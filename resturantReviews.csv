Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Travelling thru Troy, looked on Trip Advisor, rated #1 9in the area and rightly so, brisket and ribs, my wife had chicken and pork, friends had nearly the same. Great food, cooked just right, the side were awesome. The beer selection good, the service was wonderful. Nice decor, nice presentation, clean and comfortable. I would return if we lived in the area, we don't, we were traveling from NH to Michigan.~Bob W~South Lyon, Michigan, United States
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for lunch after visiting our RPI student.  Great food - awesome and different sides!  Love the maple brown suger sweet potato and the fried green tomato.  Watch for bees in the Spring/Summer when seated outside - ALSO be careful not to drop your credit card when seated outside.  An unlucky patron drop his card, and it went right through the slates of the floor!~Michele D~Fair Lawn, New Jersey
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great service and food; friendly, attentive to specific requests; good for all in the family; we will come back~cheekago~Chicago, Illinois
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice restaurant right on the water in Troy not far from RPI. Great rustic look and family friendly. Food is very good. Excellent bbq. Thought it was a little pricey for college students but reasonable for families. Although they do offer platter type servings that would be good for a group to share.  My daughter had the ribs and she said they were very good, green beans side too. I had bar b san chicken with side of chili, both were very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place.  It also had its own parking lot which is rare in downtown Troy. Service was very good. Food came out quick and was hot.~DCfromCT~Southbury, Connecticut
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like the Dinosaur, but it doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be when I would stop by at the Syracuse location.  I don't know if the food is better in Syracuse or BBQ food is something you get tired of.  That said, this is one of the best BBQ food that I have had in the area.  BBQ Chicken sandwich is good and I like the combo meals too because you get a little of ribs and chicken.  The baked beans are the best I have ever had.  Mashed potatoes are good too.  Not a great place for vegetarians.~steveredler~Delmar, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinosaur BBQ is a chain, with decent BBQ and great service.  The BBQ is pretty much what you expect, but the flavors are surprisingly good.  The waitstaff at this DBBQ were very attentive and quick to make sure you're happy.~iTravel242~Ramsey, New Jersey
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friends and I went there after reading the good reviews on TripAdvisor. However, it was a bit disappointing. The food was okay and sizes were moderate. The service was okay as well, but it took them quite long to bring the dishes. ~gloriavallfor~Troy, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can see why this restaurant was always mentioned as a great place to eat in Troy!  We had the friendliest servers, great beer choices and we were AMAZED by the BBQ.  In the midwest we have our Kansas City BBQ,  Memphis BBQ and ST Louis BBQ , but this BBQ almost made the pig cry for joy!!  Well done,  well done!!~75barbaraleo~O'Fallon, Missouri
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After several years of waiting (around 7-8), my wife and I finally had lunch at Dinosaur in Troy. She had a brisket sandwich and I had a Cuban sandwich. Both were well made, tasty and had good flavor. Mine was good, but not quite up to the standards of a true Cuban from down in Florida. The side dishes were interesting though. I had BBQ fried rice and cole slaw and my wife had the slaw and mac and cheese. The slaw was solid in that it was mildly creamy and not too sweet. The fried rice was awesome as it was real fried rice but had bbq meats in it and a nice flavor. The mac and cheese was well made but had an odd taste due to the use of a cajun seasoning, according to our very perky waitress. Service was excellent, bathrooms were clean and the whole place had a nice rustic feel, but couldn't capture the genuine shabbiness of the original building Syracuse. However, the view of the river was fantastic; much nicer than downtown Syracuse. Overall, the place was solid though I will say some prices seemed a tad high to me. But then BBQ joints, at east in NYS tend to be on the higher side in our experience.~Mseinber~Altamont, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is one of the favorites places for people from Troy and other near communities. As you enter the restaurant you are welcomed by a wooden style furniture that creates a great athmosphere with walls, floor, ceilings and tables made from wood. We were sit quickly and service was prompt and friendly. The food is really good: The best ribs and bbq sauce I have ever tasted. Highly recommended!~lcastill3~Panama City, Panama
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family (2 adults, 2 teens) visited the Dinosaur BBQ last Monday, 9/26 and only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated, which was very welcome.  We ordered two sets of wings:  one BBQ, one Wango Tango.  Both were delicious, cooked perfectly, and the sauces tasted just as we had hoped.  Daughter had the mac and cheese and found it a bit spicy.  Husband tried it and agreed, although he liked it. I had ribs and they were delcious, fall-off-the-bone.  Son had chicken sandwich and enjoyed it.  My husband had a plate of a little bit of everything and especially enjoyed the brisket.    My only negative was the outside of the building.  The landscaping was so overgrown and distracted from the entrance.  I like rustic, but this was unkempt.~debandrob0821~Albany, NY
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best Dinosaur bbq sauce I've ever tasted! I loved it so much, I bought 2 bottles with our visit. They were excellent over ribs. Their corn bread and mashed potatoes were great! They gave my son a student discount when he showed them his RPI student ID. I was not thrilled with the bathroom though. Needs updating and a good cleaning. ~S R~Troy, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a meal here on a Thursday night. We were sit quickly and served just as quickly. Service was quickly, accurate and friendly. Our server was taking care of the tab at the table next to us. they had kids and she entertained them and talked to them about their first day of school while dad took care of the bill and mom was busy with a little one. She went out of her way to make everybody feel welcome (sorry forgot her name) Food was amazing as usual and I would make a detour again if/when I go back that way.~Germain1000~Orillia, Canada
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to this location for dinner on Sunday, quite busy since it was the long weekend. Food better than Service As with all Dinosaur, the brisket is the best choice. the ribs are second. The housemade sausage could use more seasoning. The chicken is just ok. Do yourself a favor and avoid the fried rice. Great french fries, though. Food took forever to arrive, almost completely cold meats, but fries and rice were hot. Guess poor coordination in the kitchen.~Juan C~New York City, New York, USA
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While I am not a big fan of restaurant chains in general, trying Dinosaur BBQ for the first time I was impressed with the food quality.  The fried green tomatoes were tasty but they did need the dipping sauce, more seasoning in the breading would help here. The pulled pork and the brisket were both good, flavorful on their own without having to drown them in sauce. The sauces were ok but nothing special, mixing them proved to give the best flavor. Service was fast and friendly even if it was the "fake orgasm" friendly approach which I think is a bit over the top but some corporate playbook somewhere has instructed wait staff to sit down with you and make chit chat as if you're old high school buddies, there's nothing offensive about it, it's just not needed in my opinion. Overall I was very happy we gave this place a try and we would go back again if we were in the neighborhood.~optiman32~Hopewell, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the food was really good and the price for this area was great also. I was born and raised here so coming home to different restaurants and eating good food is exciting I enjoyed this place but service needs to be fixed. They kind of ignore you unless you order drinks. That needs to be changed. Your biggest tips are not from drinkers it is from the families. Lesson learned..~heather654~newark, ohio
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First visit to this location, been to the one in Harlem. The fried green tomatoes were delish as usual. Dinners were alright. The restaurant smelled a little too smoky..Needs a refresh. The service was good once she showed up and a little slow considering they were fairly empty. My biggest complaint was the Sangria which was probably the worst I've ever had. Tasted like water with fruit and a couple tablespoons of wine, gross. So discussed I drank water.~dowdross~Scarsdal
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant was very busy on this Sunday evening.  We had a window seat near the river for a nice view.  Because of the crowd, the noise was deafening--not a place for a quiet, intimate dinner.  My chicken sandwich was on the chewy side.  Since we were a party of two not ordering drinks, the server seemed to ignore us in favor of those who would generate a larger check and tip.~Rock1774~Willow Street
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My nephew took us to Peck's on the Friday before Halloween. It was wild. Of course we brought the median age in the place way up, but that didn't matter to us. We had a 9:15PM reservation and wasn't seated until 10:00PM, but we enjoyed ourselves upstairs in the bar. The wine offerings were very eclectic but fun. The bartender was great and let us try a few before we chose. I loved the dining room. Very comfortable and fun place. Even though I loved it, it was tough. There was a dj playing music and it was as loud as a nightclub - in the dining room, which made it so difficult to hear any conversation. We really enjoyed the tapas menu and the creative and fun offerings. We tried most everything on the menu I think. The carrots were great, so was the octopus. The beats were so unusual and flavorful, but i think there was espresso in there and it felt like you were eating a mouthful of coffee grounds. Nah. Also, while the littlenecks had fabulous taste and were wonderfully briny, they tasted like they were full of sand and i gave up on eating them. The server was really attentive and lots of fun. He kept us plied with a wild variety of wines with each one being better than the last. The service was great. A few minor misses on the food, and really loud music were detractors. But the people watching (on Halloween) was a hoot and we had a great time. Oh yes.. forgot about the perfect egg. It was amazing! We had to order another one we loved it so much!~yecats59~Redding, Connecticut, USA
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a fabulous evening at Peck's Arcade!  There were 4 of us and I was a bit worried as to how everyone would like the menu. I'm a vegetarian but the other 3 were not. The menu has so many wonderful vegetarian options but not a lot of meat. Well silly me shouldn't have worried!  We ordered 6 or 7 items to share (only 1 with meat) and we all loved every single dish. The drink menu was interesting & good and the service was outstanding!  I wish I could remember the waiters name (young, blond, from Oregon I think) because I'd sing his praise!!!!  He was fabulous in every way; knew his beers & wines, the food & was so nice & added to the enjoyment of the menu. We can't wait to visit Triy again & head back to Pecks for a creative fabulous evening!~offto~Pittsburgh PA.
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like to share and enjoy ordering a variety of small plates, this is the restaurant for you.  We tried many of the small plates and all were very good.  The duck special that evening was excellent.  Love the fact that the menu is always changing.  Also, the chef was able to accommodate some food allergies, which was greatly appreciated. The wines were affordable and we were given good advice by our waiter.  Make reservations!  We waited too long to make our reservations and had to go at 5:15.  Unfortunately, the bar doesn't open until six and the bartender doesn't arrive until 5:30.  So if you're going early, don't plan on a cocktail before dinner.~Claudia C~Scotia, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I simply love Peck's Arcade. I'd love to live in Troy just to be a regular there. I've been there three times, and last night meal reaffirmed my predilection for the restaurant. The food is "comfort chic." You may order dishes to consume by yourself or to share, which allows you to taste more items form the menu. Do not miss their home bread; great to wipe the wonderful sauce of many of the dishes. The menu changes regularly. Everything is delicious, with original twists and layers of flavors (food high dishes). The menu items are diverse and the specials are so tempting (we ordered both specials last night). The wine options are very well thought (either by the glass or the bottle). The staff is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is very welcoming; we like seating at the bar to watch the amazing dynamics in the kitchen. On the pricey side, but very much worth it. It gets really busy so reservations are strongly recommended. We've always gone during the week; perfect spot at the end of a long day. Tasty food, great wines, great atmosphere. Great vibe, nice crowd.~William G~Schenectady, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My children took me to Pecks Arcade for my birthday. We started out with a nice glass of wine. We had the shared plates of wild mushrooms, soft shell crab, and fried chicken.Chocolate cake for desert. The food was fresh, tasty, and filling. The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly, and fast. Very enjoyable restaurant.~Robert M~Troy
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First: make a Reservation Second: order as many small plates as your tummy can handle Thank me later Not only will the food make your raise an eyebrow More than once The service is on point The wine is boutique Go an hour early and head upstairs to the cocktail lounge. Tell the bartender what you like and they will dazzle you Enjoy!~SusanCFeldman~Troy, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I regularly go to Pecks Arcade.  We can both say that this restaurant is consistently amazing.  We always feel like special guests.  The servers are friendly and attentive.  The food is absolutely inventive and delicious. The small plates are small but big enough to share.  I love that they change the menu often.  I highly recommend the octopus.  My husband is normally turned off by the idea of eating octopus, but tried it openly because he trusts in everything from their chefs. He was surprised by how much he actually liked it.  We look forward to trying more dishes from the new menu in the very near future.~Cate A~Troy, New York, United States
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I enjoyed a truly sublime meal here, with attentive, appropriately leisurely service, and outstanding food. Upon arrival, we were given generous tastes of a great Cava sparkling wine, and the courtesy touches continued through the meal - house-baked bread (on the menu for $5, but complimentary for us), the roasted carrot small plate, and even a dessert to accompany the two we had ordered. Everything was delicious, creative prepared and plated. The standout was octopus - something I never liked before, but at Peck's it was tender, slightly charred, and almost melting in the mouth. Great cocktails - and when our server brought me a different cocktail from that which I'd ordered, he said, keep it, enjoy, and I'll bring you the one you ordered next. Honestly, what's not to love about a place like this? NOTHING. When even a mistake becomes a virtue, this is as close to perfect as you can get.~oldrose1~Connecticut
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The price tag isn't cheap, but the food is well worth it. The most interesting flavors in the area, with some of the most creative dishes. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in great food.~joesatthev~Troy, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really wanted to love this restaurant. The food was lovely and very well prepared, the dishes small but big enough to share, the location is very good and the inside of the restaurant is attractive. The staff is very helpful. Our waiter was fantastic. The maitre d' was lacking in experience. We walked in with reservations, a young man was in front of us and the maitre d' was in a conversation with him that took a while. The maitre d' never looked at us, never acknowledged our presence, never told us she'd be right with us. By the time she seated the man and returned to us, I was annoyed! But the worst part is the loud music. It is blasting! I don't understand music in restaurants. If I want to listen to music, I'll go to a club, or a concert hall. In restaurants, I like to eat and talk to my husband and our friends. But this wasn't just music, it was loud enough that you couldn't hear yourself talk. That is absurd! I had to shout to be heard and by the time I got home, I had a headache.~Martine A~Greenwich, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went with the Mrs for drinks and to meet friends. Upstairs empty warehouse with picnic tables and sheets ambiance. The bartender (young male) came down asked what we wanted then walked away for 15 minutes and made some other customers drinks (smh) came back asked what we wanted again (are you sure this time) wife got a house wine and I asked for a Jim Beam was told "we don't carry Jim Beam products" ordered Woodfords told we " only have well bourbon". Wth is well bourbon? Should known then. Order it (on the rocks) and was told "we only sell it (on the rocks) or neat". Where'd they get this guy? I didn't see it but my friend did. This bone head grabs the ice with his bare hand and puts it in my glass. The name of this "bourbon" is back dirt. Tastes just like the name and apparently it's $13 a glass. Watered down cheap liquor at a premium price with bozo, unsanitary service. All in the pretence of being trendy. Lots if other options go some place else~NewYorkBighawk68~new york
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Troy is seeing a bit of a resurgence (bars, restaurants, etc).  The folks at Peck's Arcade consistently do the very best cooking in the capital district.  we've become regulars because of the cuisine, the funky atmosphere, the service.  A great addition to the local restaurant line up.~Peter A~Niskayuna, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food --- amazing tasting experience, the design is well thought out, a wine bar     with an outdoor court, cocktail bar and restaurant all attached. Do not miss this great find in an upcoming little city.  I visited both Pecks and Lucas Confectionery which is the wine bar at different times, both are exceptional.~rnte266~Wynantskill, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While writing this review I was quite conflicted.  The food is absolutely spectacular.  However, the service was schizophrenic in the worst way possible.  To call it slow doesn't do it justice.  Its pathologically sadistic in how we were blatantly ignored much of the time. We had a dinner reservation and were promptly seated.  Water was poured for us, and we were told that our server (Kwan?) would be with us shortly.  We then sat for nearly 20 minutes waiting, and waiting, to the point where we were seriously debating just walking out.  All the while, random other wait staff were refilling our water glasses.  I flagged down a random person to inquire when our actual server would stop by to take our order.  Finally, nearly 30 minutes after being seated, he came by, apologized for the wait, and comped us glasses of champagne.  We placed our drink orders, asked a few questions about the menu, and told him that we'd be ready to order food as soon as he brought our drinks.  Thus began the next waiting period, where it took another 10 minutes for our drinks, and we finally ordered our food (its now nearly 45 minutes since being seated). All the while that we were waiting our server walked past us multiple times, without even acknowledging us. From that point forward, food came out fairly quickly, because the head chef was bringing it out.  That's a rather odd approach, but it worked well here.  The chef is clearly quite proud of his work, and always explained his inspiration or cooking process for each dish. The food itself was simply amazing.  As a San Francisco area resident, i'm fortunate enough to have a wide array of quality dining options.  Peck's could easily compete with them.  Everything we ate was delicious, expertly plated, and well conceived.  The house bread was right out of the oven.  The pasta dishes were all fresh & flavorful.   Once we finished eating, we were back in the hands of our server, and the flow ground to a halt yet again.  the table was cleared, random people refilled our waters, but no dessert menu for many minutes.  The same slow process was repeated all over again, and once pur desserts were served, they were fantastic.  We even received a complimemtary extra desert, whcih was also great.  In summary, the food is top notch.  The service is beyond slow.~netllama~Sf Bay Area
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Part of the food renaissance in Troy, this is a great place for exciting new taste combinations and a wonderful wine list. Heather & Vic continue to grow the business and the cuisine - all for good! We had five plates - all delicious. Because the menu changes frequently I won't recommend particular dishes, you have to go and experience what is being served for you. I agree with a previous reviewer, it is far too loud, a trend in restaurants these days. If I could have heard my dinner partner, it would have been rated excellent.~xinnkeeper~Kennett Square
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sleeping in troy for 1 night on our way to Boston, we tried Peck's based on recommendation from our host.  The place is very small and cosy. The food was really great with a lot of small plates to share. All dishes that we tried were original, very full of savours and very well presented.  All people working there are very nice and help you to enjoy a great evening.  The only thing that could botter some people is the noise level. Not sure if it's every night but a DJ was there playing music. It was not too loud at the beginning but more and more the evening was moving, the noise level was increasing. Not a real big deal but be prepared for it and to speak loud whit people dining with you.~Pierre D~Maumee, Ohio
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There's a lot to like at Peck's Arcade. An inventive menu of small plates provides a great opportunity for gourmets to try new dishes. The wine menu is well chosen and special cocktails are available. The setting has a charming, semi-industrial feel. It's too bad then that the experience at Peck's isn't as special as it could be. The music made conversation difficult, despite the close quarters. The server, though well informed about the menu and wine, abandoned the table after dessert and our party had to flag down three different employees to get the check. Overall we enjoyed the meal but we didn't leave promising to hurry back.~lupaglupa~Albany, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service, food and presentation were second to none. I will return to Illium, my only regret is that it's in Troy.    It was a fantastic find.  The chicken waldoff wrap was delicious. The perfect blending of ingredients.  Another person at my table ordered the soft shell crab with potato chip, it too was beautiful.  I sampled a bit of it, the crab was crispy and sweet, a great balance of taste and texture. I regret we didn't have time to get the steak wrapped in romaine lettuce which the person at the table next to us got. It was simply beautiful.    Service was friendly and respectful of what little time we had to enjoy this adorable cafe.~EZGoingTraveler10001~New York City, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~AWESOME lunch!  Everything was very fresh. The salmon salad was great!! I am looking forward to going back.~Taurus1072~East Greenbush, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for breakfast on road trip to Burlington. Great small cafe with good choices for breakfast and coffee. Service was very friendly and food order was prepared quickly. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the Parisian omelette and both had lots of fillings. Parisian omelette was one of the best omelettes I've had. Highly recommend breakfast here!~mixfl~Florida
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was very good. Need a few more staff. Kind of hippies type of atmosphere. As I said, the food was good.~JVRyan~Troy, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Illium has very good different food. The place is real cool to go to. Always have had good meals here breakfast and lunch.~Sue L~Troy, New York, United States
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the food, the atmosphere, the historical building and the prices. This is a great place to have lunch, as the lunch prices are quite good. The ONLY changes I would make are to get rid of all the cheap fake greenery. That devalues the place, and that's a shame, because it's got such a special feel.~Ginnie C~Greenville, South Carolina
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I ordered Mom's Meatloaf and wasn't disappointed by it, in fact I was shocked as one would think that as it was titled that and they just said that it was on house fries that like most places the meatloaf was the star but it wasn't.  I have no clue what they did to them as normally I can't stand fries unless they are beer battered but these weren't and they were awesome.  It was like heaven, sweet yet not to sweet and perfectly cooked and seasoned with spices that were so light you could taste them but not identify what was used.  The meatloaf and chipotle-ketchup and melty cheddar cheese if anything drove them home so it was like heaven with every little bite.  I visited alone and felt weird at first but quickly got over it and made me half wish the wind hadn't been so bad as the outdoor seating was nicely shaded against the sun and it would have made everything ten times more perfect.~Judith F~Troy, New York, United States
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~every time we are in Troy we make it a point of going to the Illium. We always order from the daily specials which are AMAZING.  You have to try this restaurant next time you are in the Capital Region it is an absolute delight!~sijudy827~Staten Island, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place had a large selection of unique offerings.  It is hard to choose but everything is good so you don't need to worry.  Go with friends willing to share their dish!!   This was such a nice surprise and bigger than it looks from the entrance.~FionaPepper~Troy, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fast courteous service, very accommodating for special diets. Never rushed, and excellent food ..Daughter and myself are vegetarians, and had no problem with the many selections. ~Bill M~Troy, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely restaurant in downtown Troy that has an excellent menu for breakfast and lunch. I think Troy has better chefs now than Saratoga in terms of chef owned businesses. My honest opinion. Wedge salad is excellent as is the duck confit something or other I had. The Ilium has always been known for its excellent cuisine & never fails to deliver.  A pleasure to try out new items on their menu. They have a back room available for larger crowds with excellent bathrooms. One of my perennial all -time favorite places to eat.  ~Adirondacker1~Saratoga Springs, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We come to the Capital region 6 times a year, as that our oldest daughter and her boyfriend J live in the nearby area. Each time we visit our daughter suggests a new restaurant that the two of the have found.  We're from Long Island and thusly have had the opportunity to eat in great restaurants on both the Island and NYC. Now we don't claim to be extreme food critics...but we do know what great food taste like. We came here for brunch before going to the Troy Farmers Market and this place can go toe to toe with the best NYC has to offer. My wife had a Breakfast Sandwich which was a scrambled egg with goat cheese in a herb wrap, my daughter had the Eggs Benedict with Tarragon Hollandaise sauce and J and I had the Corned Beef Hash. I tried a bit of all three selections, to say that they were awesome...somehow seems shortchanging the quality of food that was presented.  The service is above par in comparison to the multitudes of resturants that we've eaten at throughout the entire eastern seaboard. I could go on and on...but the best recommendation I can make is go there for yourself and be prepared to be delighted. ~Steve T~Sayville, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited this restaurant with friends who live nearby and who have eaten here before. They suggested it for dinner. We shared. The pupu platter which had egg rolls, skewered chicken & pork, tempura shrimp, BBQ spare ribs. It was just ok nothing special. My combination platter of pepper steak, fried rice and egg roll was average. My husband enjoyed his shrimp Kung Pao spicy dish. Our friends said their food was very good. I found the prices to be high compared to the quality and size of the portions. The waitress was pleasant but not overly attentive. I thought that being a sit down Chinese restaurant we would be served ice cream or fruit for dessert but I was sadly disappointed. Oh, well I can tell you that the room is very pretty. ~veteran11~Delray Beach, Florida
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Passed this place many times because of something I had to do in Albany, finally stopped there for lunch on the last day. Wish we had discovered it earlier. The food was excellent, and I mean really top-notch Chinese food. Had the General Tso's chicken and hot and sour soup - both great. My wife had a dish whose name I can't recall but it was basically shrimp over spinach noodles with a lemony-cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious. Portions were large enough that we each took some home and I think they were both priced at $8.95 for lunch. Only problem - we had to wait FOREVER for the check after we had finished eating, which is really a pet peeve of mine; otherwise I'd have given it a "5" rating (there were only 2 servers for what looked to be at least 12 tables worth of diners).~Bill S~Jacksonville, Vermont
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The first thing I noticed walking into the Plum Blossom was the very attractive ambience. Lots of woodwork. Very appealing. Although much of the Plum Blossom's menu is standard fare,  they also have items on it I haven't seen elsewhere. I had a beef dish that came with a fruity curry sauce. A friend had an item called Singapore Street Noodles(very tasty); and another friend had an appealing dish of shrimp and noodles in a coconut cream sauce. While I have been to better Chinese restaurants, I would certainly rate the Plum Blossom as a place worth repeated visits.~Beeper99_12~Hudson, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Typical Chinese food, nothing special. The waitstaff were friendly but didn't check on us enough. I had egg foo young and they make it without bean sprouts and put a brown gravy on it. It seemed freshly prepared but not much flavor. The sweet and sour chicken was heavy breaded and deep fried too greasy for our taste. Anyway, not bad but nothing noteworthy either.~karen m~Desert Hot Springs, California
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good chinese food with a very nicely decorated interior and exceptionally friendly staff.      Will definitely be back again.~BL_LI~LI, NY
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nothing much really from the outside, this is a wonderful place for Chinese food in Troy, NY.  The inside decor is very nice, the service is courteous and the food is delicious and well priced.  My adult kids and I have eaten here a half dozen times in the past 6 months and have never been disappointed.  We've also had a few to-go orders which were the best from the area.   Highly recommended.~agarneau~Albany, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a traditional Chinese restaurant beautifully decorated. Center of the main dining room has 2 exquisitely carved wooden vases & other Oriental accessories. Add white table cloths on tables & a pot of tea! Food is well prepared & delicious! Nice menu. Good for whole family & eat with chopsticks for fun!~cookiegran~North Naples, Florida
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a wonderful dinner that was hot and fresh at the Plum Blossom. The menu has a wonderful variety and the atmosphere is soothing. Along with all of these attributes the interior is beautiful and comfortable.  A nice place for dinner!~Thea M~Cody, Wyoming, United States
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is delicious and made even better by the atmosphere! Friendly and prompt service. The prices are a little higher than your typical Chinese restaurant, but the portion sizes and flavor more than makes up for the increase. ~mynes001~Troy, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved our lunch, staff very nice, however no one at the door so we stood there awhile until someone greeted us to take us to a table and we would return.~2013TravelinFool~Yuma, Arizona
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I will first say that the craftsmanship put into this place is outstanding... a work in progress on the outside BUT A Masterpiece on the Inside... VERY WELL DONE... which makes the dining experience very pleasant.. The service was great... had gotten the dim sum for an app and was delish. I have never had it served the way they do and certainly no complaints about the dish either.  I got the Pad Thai and my friend got the General Tso's chicken... I will say I've had better Pad Thai in other places... it wasn't bad I've just had better... now... the General Tso's chicken... OFF THE HOOK FANTASTIC!!! best I've ever tasted for real. Unbelievable... perfect because I can tell they make it different then anywhere else I've tried it. The only thing I can say disappointing about Plum Blossom is that they should really get a Saki menu. They only have one kind and they serve it hot. You can't get it cold... wait doesn't it come at room temp? Anyway, I love my Saki luckily I was in a warm Saki mood anyway. I would suggest going anyway!!! ENJOY!!!~William O~Albany, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My nephew, who attended RPI, told me about this place.  He said his parents would always book a reservation here when they came to visit him at school.  It's a big place, so they often have reservation slots available. But definitely make a reservation if it's a big weekend at RPI, you'll wait a long time if you just stop in.  Typical Chinese fare, nothing very special about the menu, but that makes is a good choice for a crowd.  Plenty to choose from.~12RAS302~Albany, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The interior is beautiful and makes for a very elegant and pretty ambiance. The service is very slow. If we order three dishes we will get them at three different times, often served cold. Waiting times to get a table are long too. We used to go there often but hadly do so anymore because of the incredibly  slow service.~Nele73~New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My daughter and I found this lovely Asian restaurant on route 7 going east out of Troy. The lo mein noodles were fabulous: tasty, complex, good portion size.  Many of the items were not quite like "every other Asian-American place;" the gyoza and the shumai dumplings had not-quite familiar fillings, but variety is nice!  The dining room is gorgeous; surfaces are ornate with varieties of artistic wood surfaces and sculptures and artwork. Go just to be impressed by the walls and ceiling!~Erica T~West Chester, United States
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is great!  And the hand carved woodwork makes for a great atmosphere.  It is elegant but you don't have to dress elegant.  Cocktails available.  Ample parking.~Kathleen A H~Troy, United States
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very efficient service. Excellent food. Atmosphere inviting. Good place to bring family and friends for a special occasion.~Gail R~Troy, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped to eat at Plum Blossom as we were driving through. We were expecting just a small little strip mall Chinese restaurant, and we're pleasantly surprised. When we arrived there were quite a bit of people waiting in the front entrance to be sat and to pick up to go orders, but we were brought to a table very quickly. The service wasn't the quickest, but when you are seated you are brought hot tea and fried wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard sauce for dipping. This helped hold us over, we were starving.  The menu offers a great variety of vegetarian options, as well as all the traditional items. The food was great, and the serving sizes are quite large. ~Kristen R~Denver, Colorado
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our son got married here the last Friday in October. What a great place. The service was incredible and the food very delicious. They really can handle a big crowd as there were about 130 people. There  also was plenty of room for the band and everyone up and dancing.~Linda S~Thousand Oaks, California
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~only downside is can be noisy. I likely get the sampler of 4-5 4oz glasses of their different beers and ales~george r~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is our go to place when we want good solid food..it never fails..our waitress was very friendly & accommodating!  Food was very good..when home with leftovers..~anna10302016~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had lunch here with the family, after picking up our student at RPI.  Great service; great beer; good quality food; relaxed atmosphere - great to sit outside on a sunny day.~Michele D~Fair Lawn, New Jersey
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While our waitress was lovely, the food was just awful!  I ordered a tuna salad over greens, dressing on the side.  The greens were soaking wet, & I'd say at least half of them were slimy & uneatable!  My husband's salad too, the Cobb, while not quite as slimy as mine, was also disgusting.  How could the kitchen send these out??~jf2189~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located on the Hudson River, Brown's appeals to everyone. Inside and Outside dining. Good for small group get togethers, families, and bringing your significant other. Enjoy some Great Food and Beer. This is a Brew Pub, with their beers being distributed locally. For the more adventurous take in a local band at Revolution Hall, right next door. You will return though, because the Beer, Food, and Staff, will beckon your your tastebuds back.~Mitchell P~Philmont, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great beer paired with an ever-changing food menu. They even employ a real chef! If you like craft beer and a great atmosphere Brown's is the place.~rs_joe~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Brown's, a group of six, on a Tuesday night, on our way to a concert. Folks looking for sandwiches, a couple of beers and a nice setting to catch up in. Brown's scored in all three areas.  The beer is, of course, their own, expertly crafted, great flavors and variety. The Oatmeal Stout is always a winner in my book, although their fall Oktoberfest and pumpkin beers were available, I didn't not have time to sample.  I guess I'll just have to go back.  The service was great.  Our server was pleasant, knowledgable and efficient. The food was served promptly and was excellent.  My Uncle Sam burger was rare as requested, and onion rings crispy. The final bill surprised us all.  Very reasonably priced. Good job-High marks.~jelmwood~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for an after graduation lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Naturally the beer selection was endless. They have a large menu with some daily specials. Mallory our waitress was very attentive to our needs. Large burgers (The Uncle Sam Burger) and Quesadillas were very tasty. Reasonable prices too.~Philroy2014~Amsterdam, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a big fan of craft beer, I was excited to finally get to Brown's.  The food was disappointing, but the beer was good. The Riveter IPA was the best part of the experience; a nice hoppy kick and a citrusy blend.  The service wasn't awful, but not great; the server only messed up one of our orders.  The food runner who brought it out was sure to correct us though... It wasn't the kitchens fault, the server put it in wrong, so I guess that makes it our fault.  No accommodation; we just had to pick the olives off the nachos.  I had bland mac and cheese with luke-warm pulled pork on top, which I guess is one of their signature items.  There are better options in the area for pub food and craft beer.~Randy H~Johnstown, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This brew pub has a great selection of beer that's made on premises and has creative, fresh pub food at affordable prices. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere with outdoor seating on the bank of the Hudson River. You can sample the many types of beer at no cost, and, they offer two sizes of growlers (larger size is 64 oz.) to take beer with you.~Ron R~Connecticut
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I consider myself a regular there. Once you go, you will want to come back. Excellent menu selections, delicious beer, and friendly service make Browns a must visit in Troy, NY. If you have plans for going somewhere else after, cancel because you will want to stay!!~Kerryman11~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for a bite to eat and have some drinks with a friend. Love dining alfresco and overlooking the Hudson River. The service was great and the food was delicious. The portions were very large. I will be back to this restaurant and highly recommend it.~maijr1119~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is decent, but the service is slow. I have had instances where I had to leave because my lunch took so long to come, and I had to return to work.~joesatthev~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner with friends before attending a ballgame required dealing with a timetable, but hoping for a chance for relaxed conversation. Our choice had to be local, with a reputation for reliability - as opposed to a chain . The Taproom was all of that! We ate upstairs overlooking the bar. It is a very spacious restaurant separated from the river by a parking lot. It was just too hot this day to dine on the terrace. Everybody enjoyed their meals and the service - food and beverage  - was spot on. A very pleasant, well informed waitress took the order and the rest of the meal was service by committee. One party member's gluten free needs were appropriately addressed and we were always well looked after.~upthehudson~Kingston, NY
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We waited 40 minutes for our appetizer to be brought to the table.  I flagged down the server Christine, she didn't come over to the table to see what I needed.  She must have assumed.  I am actually typing this review at the table.  We watched other patrons arrive, eat and then leave before our appetizer even showed.  Not sure how much longer our server would have had us wait if we didn't flag her down.  She did not come back to see how our meal was.  By the time my meal was completed she then came over to see if I wanted a refill.  Food was very good.  I would have expected a little faster service for 2:30pm on a Saturday.  We are the only patrons left on the second floor and our credit card is still awaiting pick up by our server who is no where to be seen.  Came here as it rated #3 in Troy.  Would have gone elsewhere.  The food can be amazing but at what cost are you willing to wait?  Still waiting to pay and leave.  Another server just offered to take it up for us.  Unacceptable.~SherryBerry76~Barrington, NH
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With a party of 20 we were extremely pleased with the time and attention given to each of us. Food was served timely, hot and very tasty! Wouldn't hesitate to return in the future and would recommend it to others as well. Enjoyed the evenings entertainment as well.~Bob P~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is a little neighborhood restaurant with really good old world flavors! My husband, daughter and mother-in-law each had something different and they were all delicious. The sauces were fabulous and the portions were big. You may want to share. We will definitely be back the next time we are in New York!~Celina970~Basalt, Colorado
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Brought hungry college students here.  Reminded me of The Hill in St. Louis.  Atmosphere was of a bygone era.  Polite. Dim light.  Delicious smells.  The food was unbelievable!  Huge portions would make for sharing.  Had lobster ravioli that was just scrumptious!  You will not leave hungry but you will leave satisfied and happy.  I will be back next time I am in Troy!~mjcrooksmomof3~southwest Michigan
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~YUM! I've never had a bad meal here. I eat here once a week at least. Friday's special penne alla vodka is amazing ! Also amazing is the meatball parm. Honestly everything on the menu is great. It's not a fancy place but it's very reasonably priced and the portions are huge. ~bayly79~Melrose, New York, United States
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have seldom been disappointed with any of the food at Testo's. Close to home, hot and good. They are a family place and sometimes the order gets mixed up but we eat there a couple times a month~Jim S~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a throw-back. In a good way! It's on a corner in a residential neighborhood in north Troy. You can tell by the look, and the easy way customers are strolling in that it is a place for local and long-time customers (though smart travelers know that's a sign of where THEY should eat, too). GREAT value for the money, food you'd expect in this style restaurant - pizza and all the pasta dishes. Chicken parm is great, so are the meatballs. Nice salads and dressing. Friendly service. dining room, decor, nothing fancy, but feels like home! Get a taste of Troy away from downtown. You'll want to return.~Mike R~Shelburne, Vermont
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, like going to Grandma's house for a nice big meal.  Staff is super friendly and service is fast.  Decor could use updating.  Pasta fazioli is amazing! ~FionaPepper~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Testo's Has very good Sicilian Style pizza, this is sheet pizza for those of you who are not familiar with typical Sicilian fare I can only comment on there pizza which is not the best in the world BUT it beats anywhere in the general area that i have had! Excellent food per dollar ratios as well.~jhessup L~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have only had carry out, Testo's is our preferred place for carry out pizza and wings.  Their pizza is the best I've found in Rensselaer county by far. They have a nice dining area and I'll make it for eat-in one of these days. All the times we've ordered we've been very pleased. Consistently good. Staff is friendly, down to earth and professional.~RoadWarrior47~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The family has been going to Testo's for years and years. We ordered a pizza for an appetizer. Chicken parm and lasagna for entrees. Huge piece of lasagna that was to die for. The customer service is excellent. Such a nice night. ~DaynaLove~Albany, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~For those who like the best in ICE CREAM This is the place to go Bar None Bring the entire family for the best in the area~roy k~Brunswick
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Husband and I went with friends who frequent here and are from Lansingburg. When we pulled up their were people waiting outside. Wait was about 40 minutes, not bad. Well worth the wait. No ambiance but we were there for the food. Husband had veal and peppers and he said it was the best he's had. I had eggplant parm which was also outstanding. Friends had the baked haddock which was also excellent. No doggy bags for any of us. We all finished every bite. We will definitely be back. Read a lot here about the pizza which we will have to try soon. ~Linda A~Clifton Park, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've never had a bad experience whether it be dining in or picking up. The consistency is wonderful! Their portions are HUGE and the price is well worth it!~12GreenApples~Averill Park, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Testo's has been my family's go-to spot since I was a child. Coming from an Italian family where my gram always made her own sauce and meatballs, it was hard to find a restaurant that was comparable. Testo's is the next best thing. The sauce is perfect and this is the ONLY place I will order meatballs. Everything on the menu is delicious, from the pizza to the dinners.  One of my favorite childhood memories is eating a bowl of spumoni ice cream after dinner! If you're looking for great home-cooked Italian food for a great price, this place is it!~Mocha927~Cohoes, NY
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've be going to this restaurant for 40 yrs1  Their pizza is my all time favorite.  Always consistent, hot & fresh.  The dinners are excellent.  I have never been disappointed.  The staff is always friendly & helpful.  Love this little family place.    ~Karen J~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service is good,staff is friendly. Prices are affordable.Food is good, kids love it. The restaurant is decorated in older style~magalieu~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything on the menu is delicious and not overly priced!  The building is easy to find and parking is ample.~marjie3~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love the food.Eat their food all the time. Sauce is great. Meatball's are the best. The service is great.staff is friendly. Plus you can buy their sauce for home. One of best places to eat in Capital District. Don't miss out. Try it out.~tony C~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to Testos the other day and I was satisfied to say the least. Best Italian in the capital district. If you get the chance to go there, try the meat balls. You will not be disappointed . ~Acioffi20~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is no better pizza in the Albany - Schenectady - Troy - Saratoga area! More expensive than the Pizza Huts, Domino's, Papa Johns and other mass-produced imitation pizzas, but worth every penny. You can try DeFazio's at the outstanding Troy Farmers' Market, but a visit to their Little Italy location is worth the trip. I am a vegan and find their cheeseless Puttanesca is exceptional.Almost everyone else I eat there with is an omnivore and they love the place.~Knith~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After 10 days of touring Hudson River valley, we were looking for another good meal and found this pizza. We had eggplant spinach and smoked mozzarella.  Pizza was excellent. Also shared a salad.  Pizza fantastic. Also bought cookies and those were also very good. Loved the people. Family recipes cooked by the family  ~debra p~Atlanta, Georgia
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seriously the best pizza in Troy! Wood fired, thin crust, flavorful sauce and really delicious toppings. I love the mozzabella pizza with meatballs, mozzarella and basil. The little salads are so fresh and tasty too. Excellent wine and beer selection that is paired with the food well. It is cozy inside  but can get noisy-  come early!~Beeinthestarts~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If we're making pizza or spaghetti at home, we have to drive down to De Fazio's to get sauce. My husband will not have it any other way. After trying it myself, I completely understand. We've tried a few of the different sauces, the stromboli, and a couple of the desserts they have in their shop and  have always been pleased. We've also eaten at their little restaurant they have next door. I'll admit the food took longer to come out then I would have liked, but they quality was spot on and the serving sizes were more then generous.~Jolene O~United States
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was born and raised in the NYC area so I've had my share of good pizza. I'm new to Troy so am enjoying searching out good local food. So what a treat it was to find De Fazio's and this absolutely delicious pie, perfectly executed with homemade sausage, right here in Troy. Everyone told me I HAD to try De Fazio's pizza and I honestly didn't think it could live up to the hype. Well it did, and more so. I'm a fan now.   Before you die You gotta try a De Fazio pie!~John H~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great authentic pizza.  To dine in, the restaurant is small.  Setting is very intimate and cozy.  Pizzas are on the small size.  I brought my daughter and her friend. We ordered a pizza, antipasto and garlic bread.  All of the dishes were wonderful!~Lamm612~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is steps from my house, so whilst I do not have pizza often, if I want pizza this is perfect. The seating area is small, but it is fun to be in this quintessential Italian pizzeria to eat. Great choices, great crust - including wheat and gluten free - fantastic straight from the oven.~Janet D~Troy, New York, United States
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was really looking forward to trying their pizza after all of the rave reviews.  So I went on their website to peruse the menu and they have a Mealeo option...so I placed my order and paid right on the site...got to the restaurant at said pick up time and it was hot fresh and delicious...ps while I was there I over heard them say 2 hour wait for pick up on Good Friday...Thank Mealeo and DeFazio's~laura p~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We love these kinds of places and seek them out when we travel.  Great food, caring owners, loved by the locals, neighborhood feel, and more.   The place is tiny with really great homemade food.  The salad was great, pizza, pasta too.  We were so happy to find this unique place in Troy while on a road trip to visit colleges.~sueBoston~Boston
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having grown up closer to NYC I craved a good pizza, crispy crust, nice marinara, and lots of gooey mozzarella. I found it in Troy today. Oven baked! I first ordered a pie with sausage but due to the Super Bowl, they were out. They only use fresh sausage, perhaps made next door at the Italian deli. I'll be back!~CravenMaCree~Haynersville, NY
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I heard so much about their pizza and had to try it myself.  All of those reviews were accurate. The pizza is as good if not better than described.  I plan to return for some other dishes offered on their varied menu.  ~bclooch~Albany, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Their mozzarella pizza was the best!  We've had delivery from these guys and they're very accommodating and nice.  Would definitely order from here again.~laurieg832~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Imagine being thrust back in time to an Italian delicatessen complete with pancetta, hanging provolone cheese and homemade sausage topped by owner Rocco greeting you at the door. DeFazio's Wood Fired Pizzeria sits next door to the aforementioned Deli and the two are interchangeable. Yes, we found Pizza Heaven right in the heart of Troy's Little Italy.   Founded in 1951, DeFazio's still brings Mama's recipes to the table in the form of wood fired pizza complete with specialty dough's and an amazing sauce. We had the              16" Fra D'avalo pizza which combines spicy peppers and homemade sweet Italian sausage with a perfectly baked crust. Throw in a Chicken Antipasto salad and there was enough to serve three hungry people.  The food was amazing but the ambiance is what truly defines DeFazio's. From Rocco's kids behind the counter and in the kitchen, to the wait staff, all bring a level of customer attentiveness that makes you feel like you just finished the day circa 1951 and joined family and friends for dinner. DeFazio's is small and quite a bit of business goes out the door in the form of takeout or delivery but don't let the venue stop you from visiting. It is quite worth the effort.  Although we were 1400 miles away from our home in San Antonio, TX, Rocco and company made us feel as if we spent 1 hour together with long lost relatives. Thank you for taking the time to show us the business.  More importantly, we appreciate the introduction to Pizza Heaven on Earth. Who thought it would be in Troy, NY.~GoldenDomer~San Antonio, Texas
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You wouldn't even notice this place if you walked by it! We had wood fired  pizza and the crust is to die for! The pesto pizza is amazing. We know where our regular lunch stop will be from now on on our way to Rochester. ~Marty J~East Thetford, Vermont
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Did not disappoint. ....everything it was promised to be! !! Recommend the Home made Cookies toooooo  Love. Love. Love. ~EllenHolmes67~Cape Carteret, North Carolina

De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the sausage, peppers and onion on garlic herb crust. It was easily the best crust I've ever had. Cash only is a pain but it was well worth tracking down an ATM. ~smiths572~Albany, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Can't be beat. Real ice cream. No ice chunks in it. Fresh ingredients. Good service. Coffee Oreo is amazing!~Matt S~Oranjestad, Aruba
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Snowman has the best Ice cream in the area,  The servce is great.Parking  good. The selection is very good. They also have a low sugar Yogert that has only 8 calaries per Oz. IT'G GOOD!!!! GO AND ENJOY yOU WILL LOVE IT~roy k~Brunswick
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Since 1956 I have been visiting the Snowman. Soft ice cream to die for and flavores to challenge the imagination. But for my concern about weight gain I would be a daily customer.~Robert J~Melrose, NY
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Forget the overpriced Guptill's!  For an extra 10 minutes drive you can get your ice cream for half the price!  They have a great variety of hard ice cream flavors. Three kiddie cones and a bottle of water is less than $7!!!  The ice cream is awesome too!  Good quality, hard to find flavors like maple walnut and black cherry. We make the drive at least twice a summer after stopping at Gus's Hotdogs in Watervliet. ~cpjrod510~c.p.
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although this take-out, hard & soft ice cream place generally appears to get rave reviews, my experience on Memorial Day was just average.  On the plus side, per their website, they offer 30 flavors of homemade ice cream & have been open since the early 1950's (quite an accomplishment).  They produce "all of the premium hard ice cream, yogurts and sherbets" served.  I ordered a double scoop of homemade hard ice cream so I could try 2 different flavors.  As I was eating my cup though, I realized that I'd gotten 2 scoops of the SAME flavor.  The one flavor I did get, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, was OK.  It contained dark chocolate chips that I liked, but I think they would have been better if they were larger.  Also, I was eating for a while before I found a piece of cookie dough. Another negative is that they had several old-fashioned style picnic tables (i.e., you have to step over the bench in order to sit down) in the back of their parking lot.  There's no grass there, & the side I sat on faced an abandoned building with boarded up windows next door.  While I'm sure folks bring their kids here for ice cream, it was not an appetizing site or experience in which to enjoy dessert.~fba5~Albany, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Snowman has the best ice cream around!  All winter we anxiously await for Snowman to open.  They offer a wide variety of soft and hard ice cream but the soft is what everyone comes for! It is made fresh on the premises.  They offer a low calorie version with the flavor changing weekly.  If you love ice cream, you cannot pass up Snowman! Be prepared to wait in line.  They are busy all summer long.~Lamm612~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great fair weather place to go.. Take your honey for a wonderful selection of dessert favorites.  My wife likes the low low calorie soft yogurt there.  Most ice cream places don't have the flavored low cal like Snowman does in different flavors and swirls!  The lines are long at busy times, but the line moves fast with the plenty of counter help. Prices are reasonable!~Don M~Green Island
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~a Troy tradition.   From March to October, join the line for a great ice cream.  Soft ice cream flavors can be twisted or dipped.  Add sprinkles.  But my favorite is the hard ice cream in so many delicious flavors.  A real treat.~Kathleen A H~Troy, United States
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Prices have gone up,it gets very crowd,and this yr,think they could have used more help.serve was slow,but the ice cream is still good.parking can be a problem after games,in the summer~LaCat304~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like hard ice cream, this is your place. I prefer soft, so to me the selection is limited. My favorite is cream-cicle with rainbow sprinkles.~Ponine23~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great service with a smile and quality ice cream. Look forward to them opening in the spring and sad when they close in the fall.~Bevybou~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A visit to Snowman is like a blast from the past with great fast friendly service and a stupendous selection of flavors! A Burgh tradition!~Janet H~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A Lansingburgh institute. There are always lines for ice cream at the Snowman. They have excellent soft ice cream. The prices are fair and the cones a good size. The chocolate dip is an added pleasure. I know they have quite a menu but I always go for the soft cone dipped in chocolate.~Lissy0717~Waterford, New York

Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been coming here since 2013-each time we are in the area and visit our son we always go here for dinner.

Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's been quite awhile since I've had the pleasure of dining at Loporto's Restaurant in Troy and boy have I missed it.  I had the chicken Milanese and my Mother had the Veal Guiseppe both dishes were phenominal.  I called talk all day about how fabulous their bread dipping oil too.  I cannot wait to go back.~laura p~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is Troy! If you haven't been here and you live in Troy. What are you doing with your life. Get it together people. Place is authentic and delicious. The Guinies outside will tell you the same. Eat up!~RonnySlamawics~Albany, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not being offensive but it looks like a hole in the wall.  Went for lunch.  Bread seems homemade. Everything was ultra fresh. Lunch meeting so didn't look at wine list, but they do have a full bar.  Food was great!  Would love to try them for dinner.~hockeygump~Connecticut
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Rome, Venice, Florence an d Naples have nothing on Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe. Pasta like you dream of and ambiance that reminds one of Italy. Chianti and Sambuca complement every meal.~Robert J~Melrose, NY
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this little place. It's vibe reminds me of an old world Italian restaurant. You'll often see the owner, Michael, chatting with the regulars, and making sure you're happy with everything. Every entree I've ever had has been delicious- sea food, veal, steak- and the servings are amazingly generous. The vegetables and the sides are always cooked perfectly. I don't think I've ever been able to finish a meal. Another gem found in Troy, New York. ~Nancy M~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to Lo Portos to celebrate a good friends birthday.  The service was great.  Our food was outstanding. Three of us had the pasta with vodka sauce with shrimp.  It was outstanding and we all had lunch for the next day.  Great place to celebrate or have an outstanding Italian meal.~Fez H~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Until this last visit to Troy's Lo Porto Restaurant we were convinced it was the best Italian restaurant in the Capital District of New York. However, our last experience has made us go away with mixed feelings. No criticism of the entree I chose. My very generous portion of Veal Cacciatore was delicious and the doggie bag I took home, heated up the next day,  was equally good.  My husband, however, was not so lucky. He had picked the Frutti del Mare and though the seafood, mostly consisting of calamari rings on linguini in a tomato sauce, was plentiful, all of it was very, very chewy and obviously over cooked and heated up. This is obviously not a dish we would never choose again in this normally excellent eatery. The parking on busy 4th Street, by the way, but can be quite challenging.~Renate B~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can't beat this place.The food is cooked to order and it's Fabulous! I am Italian and have been brought up on this kind of food.its exactly like my mothers cooking!! I highly recommend this place.you will leave with lots and lots of leftover so bring your appetites ! The Cristaldi's :)~Susan C~Boston, United States
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Best Western we were staying  in recommend Lo Porto.   Telling us the servings were large.   The servings were large and the taste excellent.   Great service as well.~Joe T~Brentwood, California

It's everything an old-fashioned Italian eatery should be. ~Janet D~Troy, New York, United States
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was amazing. It looks like an outdated little hole in the wall from the street but it goes so far back and up that it's actually pretty big. It's definitely family run and you can really feel how dedicated to it they are. The food rivals anything from little Italy or the north end. It's a little pricey but when you realize that each plate is actually 2 or 3 meals worth of food, it is a deal you can't pass up. I can't wait to go back!~Rob M~Plymouth, Massachusetts
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located only two blocks from the famous Troy Music Hall, this restaurant aims to please, especially if you call ahead and let them know you're going to a concert.  We sat in front in the two-level restaurant and had excellent entrees. I had calamari bathed in their special sauce. Very enjoyable.~John B~Slingerlands, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm not one that usually gives a restaurant five stars but considering all factors this establishment deserves that rating.  Myself and a friend had dinner at this Italian restaurant on Monday night. It was raining heavily but that did not deter the multitude of the regulars from arriving for their reservations.  This place is totally old school Italian.  Michael LoPorto, executive chef/owner, greeted us warmly and spent time with us before and after the meal.  The food was prepared to order and both veal dishes were delicious and came with vegetable, salad and side of pasta. So much food that I had to take the entire pasta dish home with me. The price point for the quality and quantity of the food they serve is exceptionally fair if not underpriced.  Wait staff was engaging and courteous.  I will definitely return on my next trip to Troy.~Ralph A~Dorado, Puerto Rico
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A first visit to LoPorto recently was for a Holiday / year end dinner for about 30 people. Right from start with the large plattered hot and cold appetizers to the main course large platters, the quality, flavor, and freshness of all the food was superb. I grew up with Italian families and worked in an Italian restaurant in upstate New York. But, until LoPorto, never tasted numerous Italian dishes any better than theirs.~Robert L~Schenectady
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yes, it looks like a dive from the outside.  However, it's a very good Italian restaurant inside.  Request seating in the balcony.  We tend to visit several times a year.  My favorite is Linguine Con Vongole -- just wonderful!~LakeRecluse~Grafton, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although everyone  in my party ordered a different dish, all arrived floating in a gravy.

If this is "authentic" Italian cuisine, something is amiss. Dreadful.~bullklages~Santa Monica, California

He had picked the Frutti del Mare and though the seafood, mostly consisting of calamari rings on linguini in a tomato sauce, was plentiful, all of it was very, very chewy and obviously over cooked and heated up. This is obviously not a dish we would never choose again in this normally excellent eatery. The parking on busy 4th Street, by the way, but can be quite challenging.~Renate B~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can't beat this place.The food is cooked to order and it's Fabulous! I am Italian and have been brought up on this kind of food.its exactly like my mothers cooking!! I highly recommend this place.you will leave with lots and lots of leftover so bring your appetites !

Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Best Western we were staying  in recommend Lo Porto.   Telling us the servings were large.   The servings were large and the taste excellent.   Great service as well.~Joe T~Brentwood, California
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This a cute Italian Restaurant that been around for a while, food and service is good. Great Chix parm dinners!~David B~Rotterdam, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend gave us a gift card and spouse and I had a feast! Loved it all - good wine menu...good salad...excellent entrees and enough left over for two meals for two afterwards! It's everything an old-fashioned Italian eatery should be. ~Janet D~Troy, New York, United States
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was amazing. It looks like an outdated little hole in the wall from the street but it goes so far back and up that it's actually pretty big. It's definitely family run and you can really feel how dedicated to it they are. The food rivals anything from little Italy or the north end. It's a little pricey but when you realize that each plate is actually 2 or 3 meals worth of food, it is a deal you can't pass up. I can't wait to go back!~Rob M~Plymouth, Massachusetts
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located only two blocks from the famous Troy Music Hall, this restaurant aims to please, especially if you call ahead and let them know you're going to a concert.  We sat in front in the two-level restaurant and had excellent entrees. I had calamari bathed in their special sauce. Very enjoyable.~John B~Slingerlands, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm not one that usually gives a restaurant five stars but considering all factors this establishment deserves that rating.  Myself and a friend had dinner at this Italian restaurant on Monday night. It was raining heavily but that did not deter the multitude of the regulars from arriving for their reservations.  This place is totally old school Italian.  Michael LoPorto, executive chef/owner, greeted us warmly and spent time with us before and after the meal.  The food was prepared to order and both veal dishes were delicious and came with vegetable, salad and side of pasta. So much food that I had to take the entire pasta dish home with me. The price point for the quality and quantity of the food they serve is exceptionally fair if not underpriced.  Wait staff was engaging and courteous.  I will definitely return on my next trip to Troy.~Ralph A~Dorado, Puerto Rico
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A first visit to LoPorto recently was for a Holiday / year end dinner for about 30 people. Right from start with the large plattered hot and cold appetizers to the main course large platters, the quality, flavor, and freshness of all the food was superb. I grew up with Italian families and worked in an Italian restaurant in upstate New York. But, until LoPorto, never tasted numerous Italian dishes any better than theirs.~Robert L~Schenectady
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yes, it looks like a dive from the outside.  However, it's a very good Italian restaurant inside.  Request seating in the balcony.  We tend to visit several times a year.  My favorite is Linguine Con Vongole -- just wonderful!~LakeRecluse~Grafton, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although everyone  in my party ordered a different dish, all arrived floating in a gravy. There was no way to distinguish veal piccata from veal saltimbocca from chicken cacciatore. They were all drenched in the same "gravy", Everything looked the same. If this is "authentic" Italian cuisine, something is amiss. Dreadful.~bullklages~Santa Monica, California
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been coming here since 2013-each time we are in the area and visit our son we always go here for dinner. This is real Italian food. Everything is always amazing. Staff is always friendly and accommodating~Nancy1092~Wenonah, New Jersey
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's been quite awhile since I've had the pleasure of dining at Loporto's Restaurant in Troy and boy have I missed it.  I had the chicken Milanese and my Mother had the Veal Guiseppe both dishes were phenominal.  I called talk all day about how fabulous their bread dipping oil too.  I cannot wait to go back.~laura p~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is Troy! If you haven't been here and you live in Troy. What are you doing with your life. Get it together people. Place is authentic and delicious. The Guinies outside will tell you the same. Eat up!~RonnySlamawics~Albany, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not being offensive but it looks like a hole in the wall.  Went for lunch.  Bread seems homemade. Everything was ultra fresh. Lunch meeting so didn't look at wine list, but they do have a full bar.  Food was great!  Would love to try them for dinner.~hockeygump~Connecticut
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Rome, Venice, Florence an d Naples have nothing on Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe. Pasta like you dream of and ambiance that reminds one of Italy. Chianti and Sambuca complement every meal.~Robert J~Melrose, NY
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this little place. It's vibe reminds me of an old world Italian restaurant. You'll often see the owner, Michael, chatting with the regulars, and making sure you're happy with everything. Every entree I've ever had has been delicious- sea food, veal, steak- and the servings are amazingly generous. The vegetables and the sides are always cooked perfectly. I don't think I've ever been able to finish a meal. Another gem found in Troy, New York. ~Nancy M~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to Lo Portos to celebrate a good friends birthday.  The service was great.  Our food was outstanding. Three of us had the pasta with vodka sauce with shrimp.  It was outstanding and we all had lunch for the next day.  Great place to celebrate or have an outstanding Italian meal.~Fez H~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Until this last visit to Troy's Lo Porto Restaurant we were convinced it was the best Italian restaurant in the Capital District of New York. However, our last experience has made us go away with mixed feelings. No criticism of the entree I chose. My very generous portion of Veal Cacciatore was delicious and the doggie bag I took home, heated up the next day,  was equally good.  My husband, however, was not so lucky.

Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always a good spot to grab a quick sandwich or a full course meal..great homemade soups and fresh rolls.Staff is pleasant and service is pretty quick even during the busy times.  ~clubberfoot~Loudonville, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While I am sure the locals must love this place, as it was busy, we found the service and the food mediocre at best.  The sole was fishy, the rigatoni was too much and too spicy (though the grilled chicken salad was good).  The wait staff was harried and some dishes were cold upon arrival.  A large menu of middling quality does not a great restaurant make.~FloridaFamilyofFive~Viera, Florida, USA
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was prompt and friendly, but the food was mediocre at best.  The soup could have been hotter, the cole slaw was weirdly sweet, the mashed potatoes tasted reconstituted, the chocolate eclair looked good but tasted blah, and the place could use a good cleaning.  But, there is a lot of parking, the rolls were good, they give free soda refills, and welcome dogs on the outdoor patio.~Susanarl~New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hash brown potatoes and eggs Benedict were over the top delicious.  Hash browns were crispy.  The eggs Benedict were not overcooked and yummy. The four of us enjoyed our breakfasts before the crowd arrived. We went early because later in the morning we would have had to wait in inline.  Recommend that you get there about 9:30 am on Saturday and Sunday before the rush begins.  It is that popular we are told.~epuya~Sunny Isles Beach, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last week was the first time I was at Alexis Diner.  The menu was very large.  We ate from the lunch menu which was great and the prices were very low.  The selection came with a large bowl of soup.  Great service.~David S~Key Largo, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been going here for the last year on and off a few times a month.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Everything is home made.  Everything is fresh.  Everything is delicious.  I've ordered everything from wraps to omelettes to sandwiches.  Always perfect.  We go on an hour lunch and never have an issue getting out of the place quickly.  Worth the stop for sure.~Kim L~Niskayuna, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love diner breakfasts when I travel. I have them for brunch, lasts me all day. I had a huge mushroom, Swiss cheese, and spinach omelette at Alexis with homemade hash browns and bacon with endless refills of desperately needed coffee. One of my pet peeves is frozen hash browns vs homemade. Alexis passed the test and then some. They truly serve fresh food quickly, with a family atmosphere. Plenty of side and back parking off a busy street. I never had to flag down the waitress; she refilled my coffee without me saying anything but a "ummph," as I was choking down. Alexis never disappoints.~Adirondacker1~Saratoga Springs, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went three different times for the lunch special.Wife choose different than me. Both were outstanding and too much food to eat in one setting.Prices are very reasonable,sometimes a wait to get into for lunch but well worth it.~joeball296~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late evening stop, greeted by owner who seated us, waitress promptly took our order, and we enjoyed a tasty bite. The diner is very clean and neat in appearance. However, during our visit, which was near closing time, loud vacuuming made for raised voices throughout dining room thus causing an unfortunate distraction!~ArtLoftStudio~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I arrived at lunch time, and the Diner was extremely busy. But we were seated very fast and served our meal without any delay. Our plates were beautifully presented, and enough food for three meals.  I had the Seafood Salad Platter with a generous serving of potato salad, coleslaw and the seafood salad arranged very prettily on a bed of lettuce, sliced onion and deviled egg, topped off with an accent of red olives. The price was reasonable and we enjoyed our meals. I have to say, for some reason, the Diner is very noisy and it was hard to have a conversation.  Otherwise, very nice.~Bev560~Hernando, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We used to have business in the area and visited Alexis Diner on several occasions a few years back.  The food and selections are very good (I had a breakfast skillet, large portions, kid's meal of spaghetti & meatballs was adult sized, companion had a gyro).  Service seemed a bit off (busy times, new staff?).  Our service was fine, but the waitress who had the table across from us seemed overwhelmed.  First group at the table was upset part of their order was left out; 2nd group waited about 15 minutes for service (manager did take their drink orders after about 5 minutes).  If in the area I would visit again.  Maybe we just caught them on an off day for service, as I recall faster service previously.~kickerAuburnNy~auburn ny
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this place needs help, it is very busy, not quite sure why. I guess its the portion to price ratio, Eating mate had the pot roast, nice portion bit dry, over cooked veggies, mashed potatoes, all very diner like. The meals come with soup , salad, bread, nothing notable here.(attraction amount of OK stuff you get for the price) I had the chicken francaise, I think that's what they called it The biggest breast I have ever seen siting atop an enormous pile of macaroni, Oh boy I am thinking !!! they lemon butter sauce had a strange florescent about it that did have me wondering, but lets try. First bit was like a chemical factory smell on my palate, maybe some lemon substitute, as well a butter flavored stand in, not sure, except BAD. So I remover the yellow slim from the chicken and it wasn't bad, except they didn't quite remove some  of the bad bits what ever that stuff is when you by breast, maybe bone bits and connective tissue. I tried the pasta that was under the chicken which was swimming in the yellow slim and could not bring my self to a mouth full. So I say Go if you must , close your eyes, slide you finger down the menu point , order, hope, and maybe you will enjoy.~tilefish~Hudson, New York

Everything is fresh.  Everything is delicious.  I've ordered everything from wraps to omelettes to sandwiches.  Always perfect.  We go on an hour lunch and never have an issue getting out of the place quickly.  Worth the stop for sure.~Kim L~Niskayuna, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love diner breakfasts when I travel. I have them for brunch, lasts me all day. I had a huge mushroom, Swiss cheese, and spinach omelette at Alexis with homemade hash browns and bacon with endless refills of desperately needed coffee. One of my pet peeves is frozen hash browns vs homemade. Alexis passed the test and then some. They truly serve fresh food quickly, with a family atmosphere. Plenty of side and back parking off a busy street. I never had to flag down the waitress; she refilled my coffee without me saying anything but a "ummph," as I was choking down. Alexis never disappoints.~Adirondacker1~Saratoga Springs, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went three different times for the lunch special.Wife choose different than me. Both were outstanding and too much food to eat in one setting.Prices are very reasonable,sometimes a wait to get into for lunch but well worth it.~joeball296~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late evening stop, greeted by owner who seated us, waitress promptly took our order, and we enjoyed a tasty bite. The diner is very clean and neat in appearance. However, during our visit, which was near closing time, loud vacuuming made for raised voices throughout dining room thus causing an unfortunate distraction!~ArtLoftStudio~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I arrived at lunch time, and the Diner was extremely busy. But we were seated very fast and served our meal without any delay. Our plates were beautifully presented, and enough food for three meals.  I had the Seafood Salad Platter with a generous serving of potato salad, coleslaw and the seafood salad arranged very prettily on a bed of lettuce, sliced onion and deviled egg, topped off with an accent of red olives. The price was reasonable and we enjoyed our meals. I have to say, for some reason, the Diner is very noisy and it was hard to have a conversation.  Otherwise, very nice.~Bev560~Hernando, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We used to have business in the area and visited Alexis Diner on several occasions a few years back.  The food and selections are very good (I had a breakfast skillet, large portions, kid's meal of spaghetti & meatballs was adult sized, companion had a gyro).  Service seemed a bit off (busy times, new staff?).  Our service was fine, but the waitress who had the table across from us seemed overwhelmed.  First group at the table was upset part of their order was left out; 2nd group waited about 15 minutes for service (manager did take their drink orders after about 5 minutes).  If in the area I would visit again.  Maybe we just caught them on an off day for service, as I recall faster service previously.~kickerAuburnNy~auburn ny
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this place needs help, it is very busy, not quite sure why. I guess its the portion to price ratio, Eating mate had the pot roast, nice portion bit dry, over cooked veggies, mashed potatoes, all very diner like. The meals come with soup , salad, bread, nothing notable here.(attraction amount of OK stuff you get for the price) I had the chicken francaise, I think that's what they called it The biggest breast I have ever seen siting atop an enormous pile of macaroni, Oh boy I am thinking !!! they lemon butter sauce had a strange florescent about it that did have me wondering, but lets try. First bit was like a chemical factory smell on my palate, maybe some lemon substitute, as well a butter flavored stand in, not sure, except BAD. So I remover the yellow slim from the chicken and it wasn't bad, except they didn't quite remove some  of the bad bits what ever that stuff is when you by breast, maybe bone bits and connective tissue. I tried the pasta that was under the chicken which was swimming in the yellow slim and could not bring my self to a mouth full. So I say Go if you must , close your eyes, slide you finger down the menu point , order, hope, and maybe you will enjoy.~tilefish~Hudson, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The menu is the sizeof a bible and portions insanely huge but great food....if I lived closer I would be a regular. ~JanetDP~London, Canada
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well lets say parking is ok,no lines,waitress,was slow in taking our order,didn't get it right,there were 3 adults ,2 children.didn't let the kids share a meal be a extra charge for the plate,maybe as far as adults this place be ok.the side salad had the core of the lettuce cut up in it. this was the first and last,we will be here,oh if you drink decaf,watch it,she didn't remember who drink what. and prices are high.~LaCat304~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~great chicken,nice prime rib,good service manager away on the ball for keeping things running smoothly.wish they would change menu design for easier reading and making selection.~aanna47~Rensselaer, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was surprise that so many people liked this place it's cramped loud and the waitress we had was kind of rude and the I just ordered a roast beef sandwich on rye the beef was dry and the rye bread was old and dry also asked for mayo and got almost nothing on it I would not come back here again~rochman55~Rochester, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a wonderful wine bar that gives you a real sense of being in NYC. You are transported 3 hours downstate once you step inside.~joesatthev~Troy, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Why would a wine bar have only 6 red and six white wines by the glass?  There had to be close to 200 wines by the bottle though. At a wine bar I want a broad selection by the glass and not at NYC prices. The cheapest red by the glass was $10. How about a wine 'flight' to sample a few different wine? This is not a place for dinner per se, but they have some cheese, charcuterie, and desserts to choose from if you want to nibble while sipping. ~cpjrod510~c.p.
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Read about this wine bar on Facebook. We were looking at trying something new and when you combine wine and cheese, well it's game on. Met some friends, parking is on street but adequate. We were there during the evening on the weekend and found parking on the street. The wine bar is really attractive, trendy but comfortable and subdued. Great vibe there, staff very courteous, knowledgable on the wines. The wine selection is very good, we sat at the outside patio, really liked the setting. The wine bar has a dog friendly policy which I think is great. Saw cute pup when we were there. They have a great cheese and meat selection. Prices were decent for quality and service. I highly recommend trying it and we will make this wine bar a regular spot for us. If I had more than two thumbs I would give it many more thumbs up. ~rabump~Schenectady, NY
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I cannot recommend this venue highly enough!  Kelly was our Event Planner & could not have been better.   Our Rehearsal Dinner was for 40 & was in the Garden Patio, which was stunning with the twinkling lights, votives everywhere and the unique waterfall.  Food & drinks were delicious and the staff was attentive to everything we needed.  We then opened up the doors to Lucas Confectionery for the Welcome Party (we think nearly 150 attended) so then had both spaces for a few more hours.   It was magical!  Cannot rave enough about our experience.   We were there for a total of 5 hours and never had to look for a server - every employee was friendly & helpful.   Loved it!~Patricia K~Amelia Island, Florida
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A wide variety of wines coupled with meat and cheese platters that represent a wide array of local farms.  A great night out!~Christine R~Valatie, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lucas Confectionary is a must stop on any wine lovers visit to downtown Troy!  The staff was friendly and knowledgable on both wines and charcuterie offerings.  Whether you sit inside, a very funky atmosphere, or in the outdoor patio fashioned with cool lighting, plants and reclaimed wood made into long communal tables, you will love your time at Lucas Confectionary!~AutumnLeave~North Carolina
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Lucas Confectionary so many times and it's honestly my favorite place in Troy. The wine is incredible, the cheese plates are delicious and the staff is so helpful and knowledgeable. I feel like I'm transported while at the Confectionary- the atmosphere is just so beautiful.~Beeinthestarts~Troy, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I along with a few friends hosted a baby shower for 39 people here last weekend.  We had gone to great lengths to communicate the details of the event with the event coordinator at Lucas Confectionery over the past 3 months.  This included 2 face to face meetings at the restaurant.  The coordinator, Andrea was very unresponsive and horrible at communicating.  That  should have been my clue that things would not go well. I could go on and on about all of the myriad of issues we had leading up to the event (a nightmare) but I will stick to the actual event. It was held in the Garden Patio which was clean, set up and ready on time for the event. We were promised 2 staff people but for most of the event there was only 1 (and remember there were 39 guests!). The cheese and chacuterie platter was horrible. The presentation was an embarrassment, there wasn't nearly enough of anything, there weren't proper serving utensils, there were terrible tiny wooden sticks for eating utensils, plastic plates and paper napkins.  There was salad and 3 "small plate" choices for the main course that were tasty but nowhere near enough to feed 39 women. Again, a huge embarrassment to invite guests and not have enough food for them.  Dessert was to be petit fours.  I had asked for more specifics on this many times but never got them.  I know why now - petit fours my a- - !  There was a small plate of quarter size cookies, that was it. The coordinator on the day was uncooperative and surly.  I have called to speak with the owner about our issues but to date have received no response. Please do NOT consider hosting an event at this place or Pecks Arcade. You will be disappointed.~Roxanne S~Niskayuna, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late night stop for dessert and drinks. We had a layered hazelnut mousse cake served in a mason jar. Amazing! Many wines to choose from. Great ambiance and service! ~gwizz~ft worth
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late night stop for dessert and sticks. We had a layered hazelnut mousse cake served in a mason jar. Amazing! Many wines to choose from. Great ambiance and service! ~gwizz~ft worth
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A year ago a really hip place with good food and ok service. Now? Very limited food selection and what there is is unappitizing. The wine makes no prevention of being good except for the price. The service has gone from mediocre to awful. Go across th street to the Illum for. Great expirience..~558renater~Delmar
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tonight we decided to finally try out the wine bar in Troy. First time, a Saturday night around 9:00pm. We entered into the candle lit restaurant to a light buzz and a pretty rockin' sound track (sounded like an 80s alternative pandora station that fit the mood perfectly). Our goal was simply a glass of wine and dessert.  The patio was unfortunately booked for a private party (noting they rent out the patio...) so we 'belly up'd' to the bar. Eric was our bartender, who was personable and very informative. Firstly, their water is infused with fruit. What a wonderful surprise to have grapefruit and orange infused water (They change this on an availability basis).   Their menu is fantastically whelming! Not too many pages and items, but enough for some variety. We chose the Riesling, dry, crisp, with a mild citrus tang, and the Tempranillo, a lovely tart flavor. We ended up getting a cheese plate prior to the dessert. Their Eleven Brothers, Cremont, and Invierno. Great cheeses and the accompanying sauces/jams were delectable. Great pairings.  Finally, for the dessert we originally intended on, we chose the Nutella and chocolate mousse in a mason jar. Killer. The decadence we'd hoped for.  All in all, and utterly stellar first impression for a highly regarded establishment. Great atmosphere, delicious treats, fantastic wine. We are looking forward to another visit soon.  -CKV~CKVine~Albany, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friends and I went to Lucas for a drink, while waiting for our dinner reservation at Peck's (which is part of the whole place).  After we got our first glass of wine, we went to Peck's, and after our dinner, we went back to Lucas for another glass of wine. While we were sitting there and sipping our wine, a waitress came and ask us, if wanted to order something more. We said no, since we just ate at their "sister" restaurant, and we kept sipping on our wine.  After 15 minutes, a blond woman approached us, and asked we were ordering something more? At that point we weren't, because all of us had 2 glasses of wine and we had to drive home. Well, not ordering anything more, WE GOT KICKED OUT! Unbelievable! Bottom line, 15 minutes earlier, when waitress was asking us if we wanted to order something, has never mentioned about our table being reserved, yet since we didn't want to drink anymore, out of nowhere, we were asked to leave, because apparently our table was reserved... I guess, at this place, if you din't drink a lot, you can't stay on promises.~eve09092014~Saratoga Springs, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best places in Troy to take your date. Great ambiance and decor and very good wines. Even the tea is very good here!  They do the 'painting in the pub' in the backyard which is awesome!~aritra90~Troy, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever we go to Troy, the Lucas Confectionery is top of the list to go for a drink and conviviality, conversation and new friends. Cool interior. Imaginative use of materials. Something new happening all the time from showers to evening drawing sessions. Nicely presented, and tasty cheese and charcuterie. Efficient and friendly staff. Top drawer fun.~Q. C~Trumansburg, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cool wine Bar with reclaimed wood, light great light food and wine. Nice dim, cool lighting, good wine list with good wine at a reasonable price. Unique cheeses and charcuterie.~Billsfun7~Latham, New York, United States
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Downtown Troy is architecturally gorgeous and loaded with fun bars and restaurants. Fall is the perfect time to walk around and then stop in one of them for a pint or two.  But it's hard to imagine anybody having more craft beers on tap at once than The Ruck. And they have the small 5 oz choice for easy sampling if you don't want to commit to the larger sizes. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a nice mix of twenty-somethings, college-age and middle-age. Didn't have any food but had a pretty good time at the bar chatting up the bartenders and watching baseball.~mhfella~Upstate New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was under the impression before going The Ruck was more of a pub.  It's really a bar with a few tables.  Sat for a while before anyone acknowledged us.  However, food was good.  Burger was one of the best I've had.  Fries were a touch soggy/limp for me.  Overall may go again for food, but ambiance is not my scene.  Street parking only.~M C~Troy, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my first visit to The Ruck which was mentioned as one of the local bars participating in the Great Migration promotion for Goose Island brewery. The small plate menu was enticing but we were there for the Breakfast for Dinner beer pairings. My friend ordered the salmon omelette while I had the hanger steak with poached egg and hash browns. The food came out fast, portions were satisfying and delicious. The server was friendly and knowledgable and the beer pairings made the whole experience more quirky and fun. I plan on returning to explore some more.~Linda G~selkirk, United States
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried out the upscale restaurant literally up the stairs at the Ruck. The food was inventive and delicious,  the beer list great, the waiter knowledgeable. .but there was something in the air that made our eyes burn, and it was so noisy...even with just our group of six..that we couldn't hear when a group filled the rest of the 30 or so seats, it was unbearable!  Hence my 3 star review.  Acoustics and air filtration , people!~kelly48571~Schaghticoke, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great bar, mostly college age kids. Big list of beers but the main thing I see, the wings. Simply the best around!~JVRyan~Troy, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're in the Albany, NY area, you must take the time to go to the Ruck to have their Wings. They have the best wings around with home made blue cheese dressing, great selection of  beer on tap and all of their other food is good too. You can shoot darts and i believe there are a couple of pool tables and possibly another game.  Great place to go with a group of friends or dine alone, because the odds of meeting someone really cool are pretty good. People are always friendly in this atmosphere, so sit at the bar, have a beer and make some new friends!~donnac93940~South Lake Tahoe
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My young adult son and I met an old friend from my high school days here for lunch today.  We enjoyed the beer (danged if I can remember what all we drank, but it was delicious and the perfect temperature) and split two orders of wings (medium and Thai chile) and an order of mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce.  I've had better fried cheese, but the wings were transcendent.  We were too sated to order anything else, but there's always next time. This pub is a great choice for a  casual chow-down and adult beverages.  It would be perfect if finding parking in downtown Troy weren't such an exercise in frustration!~Lori12309~Niskayuna, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Ruck reminded me of a hundred places I used to go in college, but nicer. The casual atmosphere is welcoming and the comfort food is good. They have an excellent beer selection and the bartenders are knowledgeable about their stock. If you're looking for a trendy place, this is not the right choice. But, if you're looking for a solid, down-to-earth place to enjoy some time with friends, give The Ruck a whirl!~eluper~Albany, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My companion and I went to the Ruck because we knew that they had a great selection of beers, and we had heard that they had "prize winning" wings. On the first count there is no arguement.  As far as the wings...they were good, and I would happily have them again, but I didn't think that they were all that much better than wings I have had in many other places. The bleu cheese was sub-par as were the onion rings that I had. Companion said that fries were OK, but nothing to rave about.  Ambience was loud, hip anti-elegant, and funky-fun. Service was about what I would expect, not top end restaurant, but good enough.  If I am in Troy and want wings I will go there again, but more because of the beer.~PainterRob~Delmar, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I recently moved back to the Albany area and I decided to try out The Ruck. Place wasn't too crowded on a Tuesday night. All craft beers and they are cheap compared to most bars, with most pints being around $5. I went to undergrad in Buffalo and I can say that the wings here are the best I've had outside of the Buffalo area. They've just earned a regular customer.~cl1994~Albany, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My favorite bar in Troy - for beer and for bar food. If its what you're craving, its worth checking out. I haven't had better wings anywhere in the Capital District. It can get crowded so, if thats not your scene then...take that into consideration. ~Don T~Clifton Park, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lots of beer, staff knows what each tastes like, the style, etc.  Consistently good food across several trips, especially the wings.  Empanadas were very good this last visit.  Gets busy, be prepared to wait for food!~Ann-Non-E-Mouse~Morehead City, North Carolina
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Older bar, dark with lots of wood. Excellent service, and the pub fare is very good, excellent stuff.~feralman~usa
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~OK, from the looks, a rough gem, though walk right in because it is definitely a gem!  From an excellent menu & kitchen, to an amazingly friendly wait staff & bartenders, and a very cool beer & cider & whiskey selection, you will want to make yourself comfortable & just hang out awhile.  This is a really cool pub that almost looks like a dive bar though you quickly realize it is so much more. My wife and I visited (1st time) on a Sunday evening with only 45 minutes before seeing Craig Ferguson at Troy Savings Bank Music Hall (2 blocks away). We wished we could have stayed longer. The woman who waited our table kept our orders moving so we could make the show, and she worked with the kitchen to place the order with grace & efficiency (thank you!), which made us feel relaxed and not rushed.  And, even the bartender went out of his way to say thanks and goodbye when we left ... nice touch guys.   With a couple of great pints, we also had very different food orders and both were excellent ... we want to return to try many other cool items on the menu, not to mention the great selection & variety of craft beer & ciders, served by real pros.  They even had an impressive variety of veg/vegan menu selections. Can you tell we liked the place?.   Find a reason to go here for the amazing kitchen, friendliness, and variety & selection  of beer (they're obviously tuned into the craft brew and hard cider scene, very cool).  The music energy is very cool, too.  And, be hungry when you come, because the menu is such a pleasant surprise.  Why go to that overcrowded semi-famous barbecue place when you can get bigger, better, more creative, more cool choices of really cool food & drink here?  It's so much more than just pub food, more than just comfort food, with a really creative menu with sizable dishes & very reasonable prices.  Yeah, we'll definitely be back.~Paul B~Altamont, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I visited The Ruck during RPI parent orientation.  We were hot, thirsty, and sad about leaving our youngster behind.  The bartender (I sadly cannot recall his name, only that it isn't Joe) quickly assessed which alcoholic beverages and food would transiently improve our mental health and made appropriate suggestions.  I had an Al Bundy and my hubby had craft beer on tap, and we had the quesadillas, which were very fresh and tasty -- restaurant quality- not at all like typical bar food-- and delivered promptly.  The Ruck attracts an educated and jovial crowd.  You should go.~Patricia H~Chapel Hill, North Carolina
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are into beer and good food, this is your place.  They have several staffers that have been trained and received certification in beer tasting and serving - Cicerone certified.  They take the beer very seriously.  Then they hired a CIA (Culinary Institute of America) graduate to run the kitchen.  Now that's how to run a bar, get employees who are passionate about what they do, then motivate them to excel.~Tom F~Albany, NY

I haven't had better wings anywhere in the Capital District. It can get crowded so, if thats not your scene then...take that into consideration. ~Don T~Clifton Park, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lots of beer, staff knows what each tastes like, the style, etc.  Consistently good food across several trips, especially the wings.  Empanadas were very good this last visit.  Gets busy, be prepared to wait for food!~Ann-Non-E-Mouse~Morehead City, North Carolina
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Older bar, dark with lots of wood. Excellent service, and the pub fare is very good, excellent stuff.~feralman~usa
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~OK, from the looks, a rough gem, though walk right in because it is definitely a gem!  From an excellent menu & kitchen, to an amazingly friendly wait staff & bartenders, and a very cool beer & cider & whiskey selection, you will want to make yourself comfortable & just hang out awhile.  This is a really cool pub that almost looks like a dive bar though you quickly realize it is so much more. My wife and I visited (1st time) on a Sunday evening with only 45 minutes before seeing Craig Ferguson at Troy Savings Bank Music Hall (2 blocks away). We wished we could have stayed longer. The woman who waited our table kept our orders moving so we could make the show, and she worked with the kitchen to place the order with grace & efficiency (thank you!), which made us feel relaxed and not rushed.  And, even the bartender went out of his way to say thanks and goodbye when we left ... nice touch guys.   With a couple of great pints, we also had very different food orders and both were excellent ... we want to return to try many other cool items on the menu, not to mention the great selection & variety of craft beer & ciders, served by real pros.  They even had an impressive variety of veg/vegan menu selections. Can you tell we liked the place?.   Find a reason to go here for the amazing kitchen, friendliness, and variety & selection  of beer (they're obviously tuned into the craft brew and hard cider scene, very cool).  The music energy is very cool, too.  And, be hungry when you come, because the menu is such a pleasant surprise.  Why go to that overcrowded semi-famous barbecue place when you can get bigger, better, more creative, more cool choices of really cool food & drink here?  It's so much more than just pub food, more than just comfort food, with a really creative menu with sizable dishes & very reasonable prices.  Yeah, we'll definitely be back.~Paul B~Altamont, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I visited The Ruck during RPI parent orientation.  We were hot, thirsty, and sad about leaving our youngster behind.  The bartender (I sadly cannot recall his name, only that it isn't Joe) quickly assessed which alcoholic beverages and food would transiently improve our mental health and made appropriate suggestions.  I had an Al Bundy and my hubby had craft beer on tap, and we had the quesadillas, which were very fresh and tasty -- restaurant quality- not at all like typical bar food-- and delivered promptly.  The Ruck attracts an educated and jovial crowd.  You should go.~Patricia H~Chapel Hill, North Carolina
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are into beer and good food, this is your place.  They have several staffers that have been trained and received certification in beer tasting and serving - Cicerone certified.  They take the beer very seriously.  Then they hired a CIA (Culinary Institute of America) graduate to run the kitchen.  Now that's how to run a bar, get employees who are passionate about what they do, then motivate them to excel.~Tom F~Albany, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Downtown Troy is architecturally gorgeous and loaded with fun bars and restaurants. Fall is the perfect time to walk around and then stop in one of them for a pint or two.  But it's hard to imagine anybody having more craft beers on tap at once than The Ruck. And they have the small 5 oz choice for easy sampling if you don't want to commit to the larger sizes. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a nice mix of twenty-somethings, college-age and middle-age. Didn't have any food but had a pretty good time at the bar chatting up the bartenders and watching baseball.~mhfella~Upstate New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was under the impression before going The Ruck was more of a pub.  It's really a bar with a few tables.  Sat for a while before anyone acknowledged us.  However, food was good.  Burger was one of the best I've had.  Fries were a touch soggy/limp for me.  Overall may go again for food, but ambiance is not my scene.  Street parking only.~M C~Troy, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my first visit to The Ruck which was mentioned as one of the local bars participating in the Great Migration promotion for Goose Island brewery. The small plate menu was enticing but we were there for the Breakfast for Dinner beer pairings. My friend ordered the salmon omelette while I had the hanger steak with poached egg and hash browns. The food came out fast, portions were satisfying and delicious. The server was friendly and knowledgable and the beer pairings made the whole experience more quirky and fun. I plan on returning to explore some more.~Linda G~selkirk, United States
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried out the upscale restaurant literally up the stairs at the Ruck. The food was inventive and delicious,  the beer list great, the waiter knowledgeable. .but there was something in the air that made our eyes burn, and it was so noisy...even with just our group of six..that we couldn't hear when a group filled the rest of the 30 or so seats, it was unbearable!  Hence my 3 star review.  Acoustics and air filtration , people!~kelly48571~Schaghticoke, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great bar, mostly college age kids. Big list of beers but the main thing I see, the wings. Simply the best around!~JVRyan~Troy, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're in the Albany, NY area, you must take the time to go to the Ruck to have their Wings. They have the best wings around with home made blue cheese dressing, great selection of  beer on tap and all of their other food is good too. You can shoot darts and i believe there are a couple of pool tables and possibly another game.  Great place to go with a group of friends or dine alone, because the odds of meeting someone really cool are pretty good. People are always friendly in this atmosphere, so sit at the bar, have a beer and make some new friends!~donnac93940~South Lake Tahoe
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My young adult son and I met an old friend from my high school days here for lunch today.  We enjoyed the beer (danged if I can remember what all we drank, but it was delicious and the perfect temperature) and split two orders of wings (medium and Thai chile) and an order of mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce.  I've had better fried cheese, but the wings were transcendent.  We were too sated to order anything else, but there's always next time. This pub is a great choice for a  casual chow-down and adult beverages.  It would be perfect if finding parking in downtown Troy weren't such an exercise in frustration!~Lori12309~Niskayuna, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Ruck reminded me of a hundred places I used to go in college, but nicer. The casual atmosphere is welcoming and the comfort food is good. They have an excellent beer selection and the bartenders are knowledgeable about their stock. If you're looking for a trendy place, this is not the right choice. But, if you're looking for a solid, down-to-earth place to enjoy some time with friends, give The Ruck a whirl!~eluper~Albany, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My companion and I went to the Ruck because we knew that they had a great selection of beers, and we had heard that they had "prize winning" wings. On the first count there is no arguement.  As far as the wings...they were good, and I would happily have them again, but I didn't think that they were all that much better than wings I have had in many other places. The bleu cheese was sub-par as were the onion rings that I had. Companion said that fries were OK, but nothing to rave about.  Ambience was loud, hip anti-elegant, and funky-fun. Service was about what I would expect, not top end restaurant, but good enough.  If I am in Troy and want wings I will go there again, but more because of the beer.~PainterRob~Delmar, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I recently moved back to the Albany area and I decided to try out The Ruck. Place wasn't too crowded on a Tuesday night. All craft beers and they are cheap compared to most bars, with most pints being around $5. I went to undergrad in Buffalo and I can say that the wings here are the best I've had outside of the Buffalo area. They've just earned a regular customer.~cl1994~Albany, New York
