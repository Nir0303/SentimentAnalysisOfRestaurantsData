&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~&pizza rocks! What a cool concept - it's build your own pizza, and they cook it in literally 2 seconds. Ingredients are super fresh, pizza is super delicious and healthier than most. Plus, for a mere $9 you get a very filling personal pizza and they're open late. A dream come true for late night quick-service pizza! Please come to Boston!~Kait_De~Boston, Massachusetts
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another great trip advisor find, just as good as any pizza I've had at the top rated pizza places in Chicago or New York. If you like pizza I can't imagine a better spot anywhere else in DC. We need one of these in Ocean City ~Oclo812~Ocean City, Maryland
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I found this on Trip Advisor listed as one of the top restaurants. The pizza was really good and unique. It is shaped like a skateboard and they use high quality ingredients. It was prepared and cooked within minutes. There isn't a lot of seating inside, but they have a couple tables outside as well. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. It was a great mid afternoon meal after walking all around the historic sites. The price was very reasonable as well.~MDF_U2~Irvine, California, United States
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Listen, I'm a huge fan of the whole &pizza scene... but it is comical to see this as the number 2 restaurant in all of DC.    Now that I got my preface out of the way... I can talk about the meat & potatoes (or the pizza).  I've probably been to this location a half dozen times by now and have never been disappointed.  Yes, there is always a line, but it flies pretty quickly.  I try something different every time and I've even dabbled in their dessert pizzas.  The Elvis is amazing.  I reckon that if you made an &Pizza in Boulder, CO... you could have a line several blocks long to eat the Elvis... it's what I would call a stoner's dream. The ingredients are all quality and you can get as creative as you want designing your pizza.    &Pizza is a good experience, just realize it is not as good as the ranking advertises.  I wish they had more space on the inside (perhaps a second floor of seating).~Donkey2016~Salt Lake City, Utah
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice concept but it can't be considered as real pizza. Interesting toppings, fast but also average. my had the gluten free pizza which she didn't like at all...~Roy K~Paris, France
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Soooo excited I finally tried this spot. Worth every penny!!(around $10 a pop)  Ingredients are fresh, pizza made right in front of you, served hot and yummy!!!  Late night splurge!!!!~Tye G~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The idea here is to build a pizza and cook it in a few minutes.  Fine, but there is no comparison to a real pizza baked in a real oven.  Crust is thin and mostly tasteless.  toppings are okay. The price is okay, but not a great bargain.  None of us left impressed in any way.  And the selection of drinks is poor.  Service is okay.~jxx9595~Washington, DC
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza was excellent.  Ingredients tasted fresh and food was made to order.  The drinks were way to fancy for a fountain machine and all tasted like the name was more important than the taste.  Get water.  Seating was tight so get ready to squeeze in with strangers.  But the pizza was tasty!~Richard K~Austin
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There was a list with options for individual pizzas by the door. If there had been a pen to mark down the options a lot of confusion would have been avoided at the order counter. We almost witnessed a fight over the communication problem. The pizza was one of the best I ever had. The place is noisy and I would not take a date here.~Swedishfan~Greensboro, North Carolina
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a fast food cafe with utilitarian seating that serves great pizza. You pick a standard pizza on your choice of dough or create your own from the wide range of fresh ingredients. It is cooked in an unconventional way but the result is great pizza and at a standard price. Great for a quick good value meal.~Funkydoowopper~Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a lucky find!  Three of us ate two pizzas and had some leftover to put in the room fridge. Loved the vegetarian options. So fresh and fast. Good value for the money. Very filling. ~Suzanne D~Salt Lake City, Utah
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very unique pizza place, your pick from fresh ingredients and then prepared in front of you like an assemble line. Then it goes though the conveyor belt oven for a few minutes.  The finished product is a very tasty pizza.~StressfreeNDC~Washington DC, District of Columbia
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried this pizza at the airport it was great, fresh ingredients and excellent price.  Amazing sauces (we tried the garlic knot sauce), it was so good that we took one in our way back to Phoenix......LOL~perezg1~Phoenix, Arizona
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried this place while on vacation in Washing ton DC and are so glad we did!  The pizza was unique and very tasty!  I loved the homemade home created soda pop they had on tap.  The service was exceptional!~Bob C~Provo, Utah
&pizza~3461934~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When  I  first  saw  it,  I  had  to  try  it,  and  I  was  very  glad  that  I  did.  This  is  not  your  typical  pizza  place.  It  is  better.~JohnBCowgill~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always a good spot to grab a quick sandwich or a full course meal..great homemade soups and fresh rolls.Staff is pleasant and service is pretty quick even during the busy times.  ~clubberfoot~Loudonville, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hash brown potatoes and eggs Benedict were over the top delicious.  Hash browns were crispy.  The eggs Benedict were not overcooked and yummy. The four of us enjoyed our breakfasts before the crowd arrived. We went early because later in the morning we would have had to wait in inline.  Recommend that you get there about 9:30 am on Saturday and Sunday before the rush begins.  It is that popular we are told.~epuya~Sunny Isles Beach, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been going here for the last year on and off a few times a month.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Everything is home made.  Everything is fresh.  Everything is delicious.  I've ordered everything from wraps to omelettes to sandwiches.  Always perfect.  We go on an hour lunch and never have an issue getting out of the place quickly.  Worth the stop for sure.~Kim L~Niskayuna, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love diner breakfasts when I travel. I have them for brunch, lasts me all day. I had a huge mushroom, Swiss cheese, and spinach omelette at Alexis with homemade hash browns and bacon with endless refills of desperately needed coffee. One of my pet peeves is frozen hash browns vs homemade. Alexis passed the test and then some. They truly serve fresh food quickly, with a family atmosphere. Plenty of side and back parking off a busy street. I never had to flag down the waitress; she refilled my coffee without me saying anything but a "ummph," as I was choking down. Alexis never disappoints.~Adirondacker1~Saratoga Springs, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was surprise that so many people liked this place it's cramped loud and the waitress we had was kind of rude and the I just ordered a roast beef sandwich on rye the beef was dry and the rye bread was old and dry also asked for mayo and got almost nothing on it I would not come back here again~rochman55~Rochester, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last week was the first time I was at Alexis Diner.  The menu was very large.  We ate from the lunch menu which was great and the prices were very low.  The selection came with a large bowl of soup.  Great service.~David S~Key Largo, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late evening stop, greeted by owner who seated us, waitress promptly took our order, and we enjoyed a tasty bite. The diner is very clean and neat in appearance. However, during our visit, which was near closing time, loud vacuuming made for raised voices throughout dining room thus causing an unfortunate distraction!~ArtLoftStudio~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I arrived at lunch time, and the Diner was extremely busy. But we were seated very fast and served our meal without any delay. Our plates were beautifully presented, and enough food for three meals.  I had the Seafood Salad Platter with a generous serving of potato salad, coleslaw and the seafood salad arranged very prettily on a bed of lettuce, sliced onion and deviled egg, topped off with an accent of red olives. The price was reasonable and we enjoyed our meals. I have to say, for some reason, the Diner is very noisy and it was hard to have a conversation.  Otherwise, very nice.~Bev560~Hernando, Florida
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The menu is the sizeof a bible and portions insanely huge but great food....if I lived closer I would be a regular. ~JanetDP~London, Canada
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was prompt and friendly, but the food was mediocre at best.  The soup could have been hotter, the cole slaw was weirdly sweet, the mashed potatoes tasted reconstituted, the chocolate eclair looked good but tasted blah, and the place could use a good cleaning.  But, there is a lot of parking, the rolls were good, they give free soda refills, and welcome dogs on the outdoor patio.~Susanarl~New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We used to have business in the area and visited Alexis Diner on several occasions a few years back.  The food and selections are very good (I had a breakfast skillet, large portions, kid's meal of spaghetti & meatballs was adult sized, companion had a gyro).  Service seemed a bit off (busy times, new staff?).  Our service was fine, but the waitress who had the table across from us seemed overwhelmed.  First group at the table was upset part of their order was left out; 2nd group waited about 15 minutes for service (manager did take their drink orders after about 5 minutes).  If in the area I would visit again.  Maybe we just caught them on an off day for service, as I recall faster service previously.~kickerAuburnNy~auburn ny
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well lets say parking is ok,no lines,waitress,was slow in taking our order,didn't get it right,there were 3 adults ,2 children.didn't let the kids share a meal be a extra charge for the plate,maybe as far as adults this place be ok.the side salad had the core of the lettuce cut up in it. this was the first and last,we will be here,oh if you drink decaf,watch it,she didn't remember who drink what. and prices are high.~LaCat304~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went three different times for the lunch special.Wife choose different than me. Both were outstanding and too much food to eat in one setting.Prices are very reasonable,sometimes a wait to get into for lunch but well worth it.~joeball296~Troy, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While I am sure the locals must love this place, as it was busy, we found the service and the food mediocre at best.  The sole was fishy, the rigatoni was too much and too spicy (though the grilled chicken salad was good).  The wait staff was harried and some dishes were cold upon arrival.  A large menu of middling quality does not a great restaurant make.~FloridaFamilyofFive~Viera, Florida, USA
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~great chicken,nice prime rib,good service manager away on the ball for keeping things running smoothly.wish they would change menu design for easier reading and making selection.~aanna47~Rensselaer, New York
Alexis Diner~445380~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this place needs help, it is very busy, not quite sure why. I guess its the portion to price ratio, Eating mate had the pot roast, nice portion bit dry, over cooked veggies, mashed potatoes, all very diner like. The meals come with soup , salad, bread, nothing notable here.(attraction amount of OK stuff you get for the price) I had the chicken francaise, I think that's what they called it The biggest breast I have ever seen siting atop an enormous pile of macaroni, Oh boy I am thinking !!! they lemon butter sauce had a strange florescent about it that did have me wondering, but lets try. First bit was like a chemical factory smell on my palate, maybe some lemon substitute, as well a butter flavored stand in, not sure, except BAD. So I remover the yellow slim from the chicken and it wasn't bad, except they didn't quite remove some  of the bad bits what ever that stuff is when you by breast, maybe bone bits and connective tissue. I tried the pasta that was under the chicken which was swimming in the yellow slim and could not bring my self to a mouth full. So I say Go if you must , close your eyes, slide you finger down the menu point , order, hope, and maybe you will enjoy.~tilefish~Hudson, New York
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~2 couples went to Alinea with high expectations. Sorry to say the atmosphere was average, the staff was rude, and the food is better at Moto. Let's see if Moto can stay good since being acquired by Alinea group. All four agreed we would not come back.~Pamela B~Erie, Pennsylvania
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Alinea was one of my favourite dining experiences of all time.  Each of the twelve courses was paired with an extraordinary wine/spirit and a fun presentation twist.   Staff was extremely knowledgable on all aspects of the meal, wine, restaurant redesign, art on display, stemware and flatware.  Dehydrated scallop paper with corn broth was one of the finest things to ever go into my mouth. ~DSRBrady~Belleville, Canada
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Amazing restaurant offers ice-creams and also offers a separate place for the kids to play and have fun. The prices are reasonabl quickly.The restaurant offers Chinese, Italian, Indian, Thai, Pakistani and the authority lets the customers provide their feedbacks and comments on foods and the place and as I have noticed they take prompt action on a customer complaint.~Danicavolt~Las Vegas, Nevada
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~As expected of the highest order, nearly every coarse out of this world.  Bit out of the way.  I was a bit under dressed as it is a very smart, formal establishment.  Not sure whether the up selling of an additional coarse for $185 each for the entire table is normal, but would have doubled the cost.~richcast~Auckland, New Zealand
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~How should I rate a dining experience from a world class restaurant when I should not have been there in the first place?  Let's do the easy part first.  The service was excellent and the staff helpful and engaging.  The ambience was only above average.  The chef and his team timely delivered 11 courses of unbelievably artistic and creative food without a hitch.  The wine pairings were very interesting.  Now the hard part.  The food was mostly unrecognizable. The combinations of flavors and textures made the food confused for me.  Eleven creative and artistic courses overwhelmed me with too much information.  At first I was intrigued which changed to confusion at some point.  The best of the eleven courses were the corn broth soup and the cold chestnut soup.  ~GeneralGene~Fort Worth, Texas
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~I may have over-hyped the visit beforehand and set myself up for disappointment. But I fought my way through a competitive reservation process (a race to book as soon as reservations are announced), traveled 1,800 miles, and forked over a month's rent for a 5AM dinner for two in the SALON (cheap seats).... I think I was justified in expecting more.   The food, while unique, was described with one word on the menu. The servers did elucidate on the courses, but only with a short description. For what was around $40/course I was expecting to understand more about why this bite was so special (yes, aside from the taste). There were a few standout courses, tastewise, like the initial sorbet/roe and one that featured maitaki mushrooms. The balloon at the end was whimsical and wondrous. But the majority of the dishes, while mildly interesting and tasty, were not the apex of culinary adventure and deliciousness that I had been expecting. My dinner companion was less enthusiastic even than I was-- not sure he finished more than two courses (and none are more than a few bites).  The staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and lovely. The (newly renovated) space is understated and elegant. But we left hungry (literally) and feeling guilty for our disappointment. I wanted to love you, Alinea!! I am glad of the experience, because otherwise I would spend my life wondering. But in the end, it was good food-- a feat in itself. But it was not the greatest food ever.   If you go, expect a tasty but fabulously expensive dinner.~Lac1997~Ketchum, Idaho
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Just add me to the list of admirers.  No need to prattle on about all the things others sing about.  It is worthy of its reputation.  I will note a few things:  I love the completely unfussy attitude that accompanies food of this caliber.  Staff is very relaxed in what can sometimes be an intimidating atmosphere, super high-end fine dining.  And the technique never got in the way of the food.  Rather, the whole experience works together so that it becomes hard to separate taste, service, appearance, etc.  I will say that I'd like it if servers in restaurants like these--those that endeavor to tell you what you are served for every course--would just slow down a bit during their descriptions.  It's pretty hard to take it all in rapid-fire.  And it is by no means a problem unique to Alinea.  I'd say that about recent experiences elsewhere. But that is the most minor of dings.  Fabulous experience.~martw66~Kansas City, Missouri
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Last night's dinner was worth the wait and the price. A true dining extravaganza. Like watching a movie.  The descriptions given by the well trained wait staff were part of it. The preserntation was like art. THe food blended together perfectly. A night to remember and talk about for years.~bethy1954~little rock
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~This review is a bit old, as my fiance and I dined here during the winter of 2015, so we have not been since the renovation and menu updates. Our meal was incredible, however. Expensive, as one would expect, but worth it. We have dined at many of the top restaurants in the US, however my favorite dish I've ever experienced in my life was the truffle risotto they prepared for us when we went last year. I will talk about that forever.~nrohde86~New Orleans, Louisiana, United States
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~We had a memorable evening among colleagues and friends having experienced the simple tasting menus that time. The waiters were very attentive and accommodating. The sommelier sounded very knowledgeable explaining both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic pairings. The gastronomic journey was colorful and varied. I especially liked the fun intermission of the balloon. My favorite was the steak and the Mexican chicken. Unfortunately there was a foreign material found in the yellow dish served to one of my colleagues. The waiter was apologetic and committed to have my colleague's pairing for free. That was in July but they only effected it this October after following up with them. The general manager apologized for the delay and offered direct access to him in our future bookings.~Eric R~Taguig City, Philippines
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~We had the pleasure of dining in the Salon this past weekend. It was a wide ride, and so fun! I thought the food was amazing, but walked away more with the experience of it all. the china, flatware, glasses, etc, all were different each course, and truly stunning!  I never dined at the "old" Alinea, but had a amazing dinner. Only one of us did the wine pairing, but shared and sipped, as it was lots of wine! They were amazing on the front side, contacting us the week of the reservation to talk about dietary needs, which I had some of. They did an amazing job of it, and I never felt my courses were "subpar" My dining partner actually thought some of mine were better or more intersting then his!  Overall, an amazing time, and we have lots of stories to tell about the Taffy balloon, and all the amazing dishes we tried!~j D~Charlotte, North Carolina
Alinea~570063~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~We visit Chicago every 2 years for business. We had purchased tix 2 years ago however our flights were delayed and we didn't get to eat here. Finally this week we made it. Wish we hadn't bothered. We dined in the gallery which offers an element of theatre with the meal. We found the food overly sweet and rich ...even the savoury courses. They often felt quite unbalanced and even boring. Having eaten in many 2 and 3 hat Michelin restaurants in Europe and South America we felt in comparison the food just didn't not excite or inspire. Maybe we just didn't get it.~sydneysider~sydney
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A few things about this restaurant.  There were some negatives and positives.  If you can't take stairs comfortably, don't go to this restaurant.  It is all stairs! and it's loud.  I found myself yelling across the table to be heard.  I think the prices are too high..but it was PACKED for a Thursday night seating. I did not see one table on my floor empty for long.  Service was a little sporadic...we would have probably ordered more to drink if our waiter had come back more often...but he was okay...just not fabulous. I picked the fixed price menu and was very happy.  It was good food...but maybe the restaurant is a bit too expensive to say I will come back soon...  Even with two of the four of us ordering from the fixed price restaurant week menu our bill with tip was almost 100 dollars a piece. (Which is definitely on the high side for what we were actually served)  We had one or two drinks each and entrees with apps,.  My small Foie Gras appetizer was 18.00.  It was delicious, but I felt it was a little over priced.  My husband ordered the ox tail bone marrow at $16.00, and there was practically nothing to eat ...two bites really...probably should be advertised as such. (It was really good. but I barely got to taste it before it was all gone)   The portions were all over the place, some of what we ordered was a bit too small to share with anyone, other things there was too much on the plate..I'm not sure if that's just a restaurant week thing or not.  The Foie Gras  I will order again (probably why they can charge 18.00 for a small portion)  My friend's roasted pork was DELICIOUS.~Sharontwfl~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ama de Cuba is multi-level. So if you have trouble walking upstairs this is not the place for you. The dining area is two flights up. The cerviche is the best in  the  City but pricey.  Good drinks and attentive service.  There are a  number of small plates and if you don't want to splurge for dinner you should at least go to happy hour and have some small plates. I think the samplers are great as these allow you to share  with a friend or at the tableI  love the pork. This is not  Cuban food that you find on the streets of Miami or Lincoln Road. It is  tasty but a more elegant and pricey presentation.~joanz359~Philadelphia, Pa 
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Celebrated our anniversary here. What a fantastic experience! The service was impeccable and we can be finicky. Our server recommended a wonderful white wine to go with our meal. Everything was presented beautifully and the pacing of the meal was excellent. We began with a trio of ceviche and each selection was fresh and interesting. My entree, the roasted Bronzino, was tender and delicious. My husband had the goat in red wine and we loved it. Admittedly, though, not everyone would appreciate it. The sweet plantains were perfect, as were the collards. Dessert was magical and the pastry chef sweetly wrote "Happy Anniversary!" on the plate. The spicy/sweet popcorn and corn nuts mix that came at the beginning of the meal is quite addictive and our server obliged us with some to take home.~lovestotravel013~Wilmington, Delaware
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyed a dinner starting with a Thai inspired ceviche moving on to a deliciously prepared classic beef dish.  Excellent service, interesting surrounds, nice wines, and of course the food.  Will return next visit.~4SIGHT~Laguna Beach
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've gone to Alma de Cuba several times, and each time I'm very happy with my experience. The food is consistently delicious. I especially love their ceviches, of which there is a great variety. The ambience is great for dates or special events.~Danielle R~Parlin, New Jersey
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Made a last minute decision to dine at Alma de Cuba as it was close to our hotel. A discrete store front masks a wonderful modern interior. We dined on the ground floor and had very attentive service, first class.  The food was good, but not what I expected for a Cuban restaurant. The basics of Cuban were there, but it was a more stylized version. The black bean soup was great. Others in our party enjoyed the dorado, goat, and chicken. The Alma sampler was also enjoyed by three of our party. ~rbcatraveler~Califormia
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not a foodie restaurant but nice for a drink. Mojitos are delicious but just two much heavy food on menu.  Service was great. Interior creative - just seems overdone.~momma3foodie~Belvedere, California
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our server was very informed and helpful.  The food was outstanding. Overall the experience was a full 5 stars.  In October 2016 they celebrated 15 years in business.  Must try location ~Orchard609~Williamsport, Pennsylvania
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our waiter couldn't have been more knowledgeable which helped us make many choices. We had black bean soup, yucca, octopus, stuffed dates and a pork dish. Most portions were small with the exception of the pork which 3 of us shared -so be sure to ask about size. Drinks were expensive. Bread-delish! Black bean soup was good, but I make that at home just as good so $10 was a lot for it.~WorrywartBoston~Boston
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was quite good, delicately flavored and tasty. The service was careful,  friendly, and efficient. The staff was responsive to specific dietary needs and were able to suggest substitutions or offer to alter ingredients. We were surprised that for a lively place with music playing, it was still possible to enjoy a conversation over dinner. We'll return the next time we're in Philadelphia.~jpb-ny~NY, NY
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is another Steven Starr restaurant in Center City. Authentic Cuban menu. Dining room on second floor~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was the second time I have been to Alma de Cuba, the first time was with my wife following an afternoon shopping, we had stumbled in without a reservation and no recommendation. We enjoyed a lovely meal and great mojitos. This was a few years ago. So when I attended a small conference and heard that the group would be going to Alma de Cuba I was intrigued to see if it was as good as my wife and I remembered.  I was not disappointed. There was about 25 of us in the group, we had a mojito demonstration along with appetizers in the bar area. I loved all of the food they brought  out but the smoked Marlin tacos were very delicious and memorable.  We were taken to the second floor for our meal, we took over the whole area and were shown a guacamole preparation demonstration. The food was extremely delicious and quite innovative, by the time the deserts arrived we were all quite full however. But I did like the chocolate cigar and accompanying matches (see the picture) which was very good to eat and fun to see. I will be taking my wife again, definitely recommended!~101Umpalumpas~Princeton, New Jersey
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very very very noisy and very very very nice! The back beans soup is great, the staff are super enthusiastic abs happy to help, the  vegetarian gnocchi was super! ~GovindaMadhav~London, United Kingdom
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We originally went into this establishment to get a drink. The place was hopping at both the full bar and restaurant. The food look different and the patrons, both local and tourists, could not say enough about this place. Therefore, we decided to eat there the next day. We got food we never ate before, and everything was AMAZING. We totally pigged out just to try all the different things. We had the bannanas, pork, scallops, bread with special sauce, marlin tacos, and some kind of cerviche. All good. You will not be disappointed.~4PMK~California
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped by for the Happy Hour drinks which were very good and they were $6 and had some excellent small ceviche shooter appetizers which were $2 each. Then we went upstairs and had dinner. The hot bread and spread is fantastic. The scallop dish was very delicious. I will warn you that you only get 3 large scallops for $29 with a grain mixed with crab. The pork dish is very large and extremely good.for $29. The plantain side was also very good. The restaurant is pricey but the food is very tasty. Excellent service.~Ramadama~New Providence, New Jersey
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were there with a group of 9 and the ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful.  They served the best mojito I have ever had and my dinner was delicious.  I had the chocolate cigar for dessert and it too was a home run!  Our server was outstanding.  This was a lovely night, with good friends, and delicious food and drink.~lauralou67~Johnson City, Tennessee
Alma de Cuba~433418~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this restaurant was recommended by a friend and he did not disappoint, the staff was very friendly, very informative of their menu, good recommendations by our waitress, enjoyed the food, I had a gaot dish, never had goat before, it was fantastic, highly recommend~Joseph Z~Tewksbury, Massachusetts
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A little reluctant to eat Balkan food.  We did the unlimited food and drink. A deal for $49/person. The food was/is excellent, drinks were tasty as with all the dishes. Would go back again. Try the Balkan salad.~SailstarOrion~Boothbay, Maine
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ambar is truly a gem. there are three bars, that are usually pretty busy, but that doesn't detract from a great experience. one of the bars is outdoor, but covered with a roof. I always enjoy the Balkan salad, Balkan kabob and the mussels are great.  I've also been here for dinner and they offer a $49 all you can eat small plates and drinks deal, which is a great deal, especially in DC. highly recommend going!~AttWife~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ambar's Balkan menu is something I've never seen before.  For $49 they offer unlimited drinks and small plates - wow.  We didn't have the unlimited option, but chose the chef's speads, hummus (delicious) drunken mussels. viener schnitzel, leek croquettes, braised cabbage over yogurt, balkan salad.  The food was very good.  If you are interested in something completely different, this is a great choice.  Terrific service.  Strong value.~Cathy A~Sarasota, Florida
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friendly staff , very good food and wine, and the ambience is really trendy. Also I'm a vegetarian and they have many veggie choices on the menu. Highly recommended. I will go back before leaving DC.~SirDaniele~London, United Kingdom
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I got a reservation for 2 on a Sunday evening to celebrate a birthday. We arrived on time, and the host was very nice-she made small talk, wished my wife a happy birthday and quickly seated us. Our waitress came over in a couple of minutes and explained the menu to us. We elected not to do the $49 all you can eat since we were not that hungry. Our first 2 dishes came out very quickly. The spicy crab dip was amazing! We placed an order for another dish which also came out at in a reasonable amount of time. By now, the waitress was taking a little bit longer to get around than earlier in the night. She finally stopped by and we ordered 2 more dishes-the chicken kabobs and the calamari. Then things started to go downhill. Once our dishes came out, our waitress disappeared. Our chicken was very undercooked, so we could not eat it, but the calamari was pretty good. We asked one of the bus boys for some ketchup for our fries because no waiter was to be found, and unfortunately he never brought them.   Our drinks went empty and after about 20-25 minutes we flagged down another waiter to figure out where ours went. Finally, after 30 minutes of no service, she came to ask if we wanted to order anything else. We said we would like the check. No dessert was offered and nothing special was done for the birthday. We were given the check and we quickly paid. The couple next to us looked unhappy as well because they had gotten the all you can eat but were only able to order 1 round of dishes so far.   Overall- Good ambiance, cool menu options, the $49 all you can eat is a steal if you drink. But the long wait times can destroy the fun of a tapas style restaurant.~saqib55~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just loved this restaurant.  Went with another couple and had the Ambar Experience.  This is an all inclusive dinner, including drinks.  The cost was $49 per person but was so worth it.  The waiter was incredibly helpful and suggested most of the dishes we had.  This is a small plates restaurant which was perfect for an all inclusive dinner.  It allowed us to try many different dishes.  This was our first time eating Balkan style food.  Everything was fantastic.  I can honestly say that I loved everything.  If you are looking for something different this is the place for you.  Drinks are from a limited menu but we had no problem finding things to drink.  Their mojitos were terrific and we tried the Sarajevo Old Fashioned.  I would highly recommend this place!~Skyking233~Brampton, Canada
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I selected Ambar to celebrate my husband's birthday. Chose this restaurant due to the reviews on trip advisor and it did not disappoint. This restaurant is located in the eastern market area, which is a nice area.  Excellent food, drink and atmosphere. Prices are very affordar. Our server was amazing and was able to provide great recommendations as she was clearly knowledgeable about the food that was offered.  If you are looking for an extraordinary experience with a great atmosphere,  look no further.  Rakia was my husband's favorite along with the steak and fries.  We will definitely be returning.~froggiesmooch~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the food here! Went for early dinner - 2 couples- and got the Balkan experience for $49 per person! It was well worth it! Drinks are included which makes it a great deal! We tried all the foods and especially likes the cheeses, meats, the pie, the snitzel, stuffed cabbage, the pork -all were amazing! And we ate outside which was very pleasant on a nice fall day. Our waiter Marco was a great european host!~Roxana M~Reading, Pennsylvania
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our group of three enjoyed delicious small plates (but really not so small) for dinner upstairs on 10-22-16. The service was friendly and efficient, even on a busy Saturday night. I recommend Ambar on the Hill.~Lynn C~Washington, District of Columbia, United States
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sopped here with friends for cocktails.  FANTASTIC!  smoked glasses for their signature apple martini and man was it good!!~whippledoc~Virginia
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is good and the room is plenty.  The service is fine as well, though not always accurate. We received a glass of wine that hadn't been ordered and a small plate was delivered to someone else at the table who hadn't ordered it and they immediately ordered it  But the heart of the matter is the food, and while it's good, it's hard to see how this restaurant rates the stars that it has achieved.  It is reasonably priced, however, and certainly a good choice.  But you won't leave thinking you've been magically transported to a 3 star MIchelin in Alsace, Brussels, or Paris.~Philip S~Columbia, Maryland
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a wonderful experience.  Like eating in someone's home!  All the food and drink you can eat for $49!!!~shawsand~Harleysville, Pennsylvania
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Three foodies dined here and we all loved it. We were shocked at the value of the tasting menu, the food kept coming and boy, did we eat delicious satisfying nibbles. Staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and guided us appropriately. Don't miss this one.~Jane E~Long Island, New York
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very tasty Balkan foods, largely. Served to be shared by two. If you have time, order the $50 special. Make it an evening. Be sure to try some Rakia, sipped during the meal. A strong delicacy.~kisner_jeff~Roxboro, North Carolina
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had never been to this restaurant or had Balkan food. So we decided to give it Ambar a shot. It was a fantastic experience. The Balkan dishes were delicious, but what made the meal unforgettable was our hostess. Since this was our first visit, our hostess  spent the time to enlighten on each dish, interacting with us and educating us on Balkan food. It was an amazing experience, When we were finished, she provided dessert for free.  Next time we come to the shipyard for a meeting, we will certainty visit Ambar again.~Jeffery K P~ozark, United States
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~i think the small plates are wonderful, the flavors exceptional. i think the atmosphere is also wonderful. i recommend it for all~spbeers~wayne
Ambar~3845796~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~what a great place- we had a party of 4 this past friday night. we had the balkan experience.  this is really a great deal.  the food is very good and interesting.  the house wine is really good as well.  all with service with a smile.  don't miss it.~MD O~New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amelia's is in our neighborhood and that convenience is the primary motivator to go there.  The service is usually reliable, as is the food - nothing special, but when you're hungry and everything else in the neighborhood is packed, it's a good backup.~landminseattle~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Eat here after a transatlantic flight, the sandwiches were great and the place was buzzing, wasn't here long enough to return but would willingly do so~Fiona H~Reading, United Kingdom
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great location. Food is pretty good. Generous portions. Been here a few times, sometimes catch the friendlier staff and sometimes I get a not so peppy hostess.  It's not my first choice of places to eat. ~pkjersey~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love Amelia's. Food is always good with great service. They have the best brunch menu in Jersey City!~Leah S~New York City, New York
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My girlfriend and I had gone to this restaurant for a seventy-fifth birthday party several weeks ago, (they have a party room), and decided try it out on our own for lunch. We were not disappointed. They have small plates, tapas, if that is what you desire and, of course, a full menu with some unusual items. I must say that their mixed vegetable salad with the blackened chicken was superb! The blackened chicken seasoning was delicious, and I, for one, am somewhat of a connoisseur of seasoning, and this was outstanding. We also had the "angry mussels" and the ""shrimp and grits". Yes, like I said, the offerings are different. If you are in the area, or want to try something different, this is the place to go. Oh yes, the Spicy Bloody Mary is great too!~sradmd~Belleville, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My son set sail from the Liberty Landing Marina in New Jersey on the last (Atlantic) leg of the Round the World Clipper Race. We were there to wish him well. Having done so my wife and his family crossed by ferry to Warren Street to find somewhere to eat. A helpful local suggested Amelia's Bistro. Our party of 6 including two children wanted to eat outside so the tables were quickly reconfigured to allow us to do so. Our very friendly and patient waitress answered all our questions about items on their extensive menu, coped well with several changes of mind on orders for drinks and food and then produced first drinks and then food amazingly quickly and without mistakes. The food was all delicious, particularly their chicken quesadillas, their home made guacamole and their Gulf shrimp and grits. Bread rolls came with a pestle and mortar filled with chick peas, garlic and the other ingredients to make your own hummous. We each had a different dessert from their menu to taste and share. All were delicious particularly their cobbler and their Tiramisu. My wife and I enjoyed the service, ambience and food so much that, on our last day in New York we decided to forego the delights of uptown Manhattan and catch the ferry across to Jersey City to revisit Amelia's Bistro. We were not disappointed.~EricSurrey_UK~Ashtead
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Over the years my  family and I have eaten at Amelia's many times. We have shared several brunches, lunches, & dinners there. We have celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, and we even went there to share a family meal after my mom's funeral. It is a family place, and children of all ages are welcomed.~Katherine B~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Restraunt week fixed lunch menu.  even though the place was empty service was slow. then a huge group came in.    Food was decent  mac and cheese need to set up a little more.  kobe sliders were good but when you ask for medium rare i expect them to be a lot more pink.   desert was dry and lacked something.       We have been here on other occasions and i would say the same thing.  They hit on some items but fall short on others and this has always been consistent.   i would go back as they do have some good dishes and its local.~DRandMTR~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Some comfort food, some slightly upscale dishes, reliable and predictable. lots of families and strollers~LKeck~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is delicious and tastes like someone took time to create. You can leave here feeling full, happy about the eclectic dishes you just consumed, and not feeling gross because it's all very a la Mediterranean as in light, tasty, perfect. The best tidbit...even their delivery comes served perfectly. I was still craving the miso glazed sea bass a few days later and ordered it for takeout and it was put in three separate containers so that the fish was still crispy, the sauce still hot, and my veggies blissfully unaware that they weren't the main dish. Oh and if you sit outside and it's cold, they bring thick blankets around that you can don on your lap while you're there. It's just a super thoughtful place.~nicoleMCJ~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a nice "neighbourhood" restaurant, at a corner amidst many residential buildings. Cozy inside, cozy outside with sidewalk tables with lit candles. Nice and friendly staff. But, I expected much more from a gourmet point of view. Maybe we were unlucky or expected more from this bistro. Food was simply average, far from surprising or bringing out the best in flavor and seasoning.~Kennedy S~Foz do Iguacu, PR
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a very nice restaurant with great food and service. Good selection of appetizers and different seafood. I would eat here everyday if I can. I highly recommend this place for a small meal, drink or a full blown dinner.~Imran A~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place scores on ambience,service and great food.we specially like the thin crust flat breads.they are just yum.ny cheesecake with mango puree is my favorite dessert here.~seepsaxena~Jersey City, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Trendy little restaurant with a casual/comfortable atmosphere. Nice bar area as you walk in, friendly and informed staff. The menu is varied so you can get pretty much anything you want from specialty sandwiches to filet mignon. If the weather permits there is outdoor seating. First time there. I loved it and would definitely go back.~MCPEdison_NewJersey~Edison, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've been to Amelia's a few times and have always really enjoyed the food.  The menu is extensive with a great variety of small plates and continental food that's always well-prepared.  It's a very reliable local place with good service.  It's not quite 5 stars because the atmosphere is fine but could be better; it's a little crowded and loud.  That shortcoming pales in comparison to the food though and we'll be back again soon.~Arthur T~Hoboken, New Jersey
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What keeps me coming back to Amelia's is the Kale Salad with Spicy Shrimp! They also have a great brunch menu as well. The service can be a little spotty at times, which coincides with the busyness of the restaurant. Not saying that the service is "bad" it's just not 100% when things get crazy for them.  Not a lot of places serve "grits" and sad to say, I am not a fan of the ones served here. They are too herbaceous and have a bitter after taste. Keeping it simple is the best bet..  All in all, I am still a fan~Yvette S~New York City, New York
Amelia's Bistro~1192747~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With all the new restaurants popping up in our neighborhood due to rapid gentrification. Emilia's remains our very favorite place for brunch or a casual dinner.  What makes this establishment so special is the staff (very friendly, professional, courteous staff) and of course the food. Drinks are delicious. Brunch is half the price you would pay in the City and Service is beyond what you can expect.  Best value for your money. For us is a short walk away. If you're coming from the City, it's only a few blocks from the Exchange Place or Grove Street PATH Station.  Truly the best bang for your buck. Yes, there are many new choices. But Amelia's remains the standard that all the new restaurants strive for.~Carlos B~Jersey City, New Jersey
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ancora makes you think of restaurants in more sophisticated areas. Classy and just what you would expect in this price range. We enjoyed eating al fresco, which admittedly you can only do a few days a year around here. Ancora's has stood the test of time, which is nice to see around Utica, so many places come and go. Good parking nearby and I will definitely return.~maliksmom~Utica, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I sat outside on the patio for my dinner.  The Chicken Marsala was excellent.  Service was great also.~lilycrofters~Tiverton, Ontario
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are willing to endure a deafening noise level and mediocre food, you may like this place.  You may be lucky enough to be seated in the back room where conversation is just possible, but don't expect the food to be anything other than acceptable.~Rand C~Utica, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice restaurant with good menu. Very good service.Good beer menu. Beet salad excellent. Would recommend if you are in Utica area.~David N~Williamsville
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice waiters who are very efficient with great food.  I especially like the gorgonzola potatoes.  Would go back anytime.~erin a~Utica, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really enjoy eating there and the beet salad and salmon are my normal, but the paella, fig flatbread, etc. are always great; I have never found anything I didn't like on the menu!!~Bianca007441~Utica, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recently visited and had heard good things about the restaurant.  Service was inattentive an slow. Food was below average for the price point. Nobody in my party was pleased with their meal. Don't waste your time or money.  The Utica area has many good restaurants. This isn't one I will visit again.~Detta P~Syracuse, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was awesome. I sat at the bar and had really great service. The bartender was extremely welcoming as well as social. She made eating dinner alone not so bad. Any solo traveling business people should hit this spot. It's awesome. ~2011president~williamstown, ma
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was excellent. The meat was cooked perfect and was nice and juicy. The greens were also good. The seafood dish was also cooked very well. Will be going back very soon.~John W~Utica, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Three of us went for an early dinner after a long drive. The restaurant was in a good location. The server was attentive/friendly and the food was very good. Portion size was also good. Since I come to Utica several times a year, I will probably eat here again.~Karen E~East Meadow, New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a great dinner here at Ancora. Prices were fair and service was great. Small inside, so make reservations or go early. Located next door to the Stanley Theatre. Show night the place is impossible to get in unless you have made reservations. ~herovb~Upstate New York
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We needed a dinner stop for the three of us that was downtown Utica. The special of shrimp and "hats" was superb as was the chicken francais. Great service. A little loud but friendly. Worth the stop!~Lgholt~Newburyport, Massachusetts
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Ancora prior to a show yesterday. We have been there a few years ago. The atmosphere is nice and modern. The place was packed, because of the show. We arrived at 5:30 before the main crowd and ordered immediately. The staff was polite, but not attentive. We had to flag them down each time we wanted drinks.  We ordered tapas for starters. It came out relatively quick and was delicious. We orders the gruyere potatoes, and Arancini.  For the main dishes, the other couple ordered the Ancora paella. It came out within 30 minutes of ordering. They were satisfied with the dish, but that's it. It did not appear freshly made. I ordered the beef tenderloin tips and my wife ordered the mushroom ravioli. It took 75 minutes for the dish to arrive. When it did, the beef dish was over cooked and you could only taste paprika. The risotto was mushy, over cooked, and without taste. The mushroom ravioli was adequate. The pasta did not taste fresh and the sauce was bland.  We were fortunate, because a few couples were waiting for an hour and a half and didn't get served (we happened to sit next to them and the concert as well as the restaurant by accident).  Further, there was no explanation by the staff, and barely an apology.  We spent nearly $200 with tip for four. This included two drinks each and no desert.  The experience was poor enough that I may never go back. ~FaragoCNY~New Hartford, New York, United States
Ancora~877984~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Utica last night for a fantastic concert at the Stanley - my aunt made reservations and Ancora - I'd never been there before ...... I WILL go back!  The weather was perfect for sitting outside, the food was wonderful, and our waiter was great!  I'd go back in a heartbeat - especially if you're attending an event next door.  Make reservations early though!   It's great - you park once, have great food, see a good show and voila - a wonderful evening!~JoBeth13439~Richfield Springs, New York
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best Pork Belly Starter!  Fab service, nice atmosphere, great food. Central location opposite Macy's. Will come again definitely.~Panda C~Queensland, Australia
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~By booking with the Mayflower Park Hotel directly online we were afforded a "breakfast included" with our stay. The staff were always courteous and breakfasts although limited in selection (because of the breakfast included deal) were hot and delicious.~Brian W~Calgary, Canada
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~During our stay at the Mayflower, we had a wonderful dinner here.  All our orders were cooked to perfection, our server was wonderful.  It was a great evening.~twheave~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First time at this restaurant and we weren't disappointed.   Fantastic meal and service.   Majority of our party had the Za'atar Rubbed Grilled Pork Chop.  It was flavorful and cooked to perfection being moist and tasty.   The Pear Salad and Seared Pork Belly starters were a great way to start the meal, and the Spinach Risotto was a very pleasant surprise.   Dinner was topped of with the Liquid Chocolate Cake. which only wish I would have ordered 2.~NWPackerBacker~Renton, Washington
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great meal, great service, terrific atmosphere. Surprised at how good the meal was as it is inside a hotel.~Judith L~Belmont, Massachusetts
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a great breakfast and dinner here while staying at the Mayflower Hotel. No need to find something else while shopping in Seattle. Both meals left us full, food was perfect and staff was excellent in their service.~Halt1136~Martinsburg, West Virginia
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'd like to call my review "Discreet efficiency" because, apart from the great food, both times we ate there, the service was outstanding...  This place is for foodies... from the bread service with its delicate baba Ganoush, to the Hummus Kawarma, to the Paella and a great Lamb Shank, etc. etc., excellent food period...~Jose C~highland, United States
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I were in Seattle a few years ago and went on a food walking tour. Andaluca was one of the places we stopped at. We went there tonight for dinner and shared four appetizers. We were not disappointed!  And, we found that we had enough, we left satisfied. The service was excellent, the decor was very tastefully done. ~Helen M~London, Canada
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant offers a mix of Spanish and Mediterranean cuisine with an emphasis on seafood.  The menu is reflective of a fine dining location with a smaller menu and a varied and extensive wine list.  We ordered a variety of appetizers including the bread service, olives, and the potato croquettes.  Olives and bread were alright and could have a bit fresher; but the potato croquettes were quite excellent and I would recommend those.  The main course was the Andaluca Paella and was of good quality with a generous portion of prawns, mussels, and clams.  My only criticism, if it could be one, is that it was slightly greasy or oily.  Other than that, it was a quite enjoyable dining experience.  The service was very professional and unobtrusive.  Since the restaurant is not the biggest, I would suggest making a reservation especially for the weekends.     In terms of fine dining, the value for money is pretty good.  I would have no problem returning here to eat if I were to visit Seattle again.~smrgeog~Vancouver, Canada
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a cute little restaurant in town.  The drinks were a little pricey.   We ordered a few appetizers....the bread/hummus service.....vey good.  The mini crab tower....OK.  Nothing really special.  And the stuffed dates....again, OK. For dinner, we shared the Paella, excellent!  And the Z- Pork Chop was overcooked and dry.  Overall, a cute place, average service and average food.  But would give it another try.  ~Lisa S~Erie, Pennsylvania, United States
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~To come across a restaurant with very good cuisine, polite and conversational staff, subdued background music and comfortable quiet atmosphere by accident is great.  The wine list is broad and well chosen. To dine in this peaceful environment is a joy. Paella is real!  ~stewmair~Bendigo, Australia
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~To start of with something good - amazing service. Very pleasant and welcoming staff. Decor is also nice, though I would say it looks a bit dated. However, the food is the real let down. When we finished eating, I just hoped that we will be ok throughout the day, since eating it really gave me a feeling that something wasn't quite right. So, as for food impressions for breakfast, I was very disappointed and will not come here again for breakfast.~Dani H~Tel Aviv, Israel
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very convenient location in center city.  Located off the lobby of the Mayflower Park Hotel.  Service is a hallmark, but might be a little expensive for some.~Rich Y~Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate breakfast twice here during our stay at The Mayflower. The breakfast was good- not the best ever, but hot and probably the best bacon ever and very good coffee. Our waitress, Kathleen was awesome and full of great advice on what to do and where to eat, etc. The staff at breakfast were all friendly and helpful. Very well done!~raferjack~Corpus Christi, Texas
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a wonderful dinner here.  Our favorite was the Brussels sprouts sauteed in butter, and the pork loin.  We also ordered a selection of drinks, but the sangria was our favorite drink.   It is close to downtown stores, has an intimate atmosphere with booths, was quiet enough for conversation even when the restaurant was full of other guests.  The service was friendly and helpful.  ~drmarydrmary~Seattle, Washington
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had breakfast here on our first morning. Definitely not cheap, but great food and service.  The bacon in my husbands meal was incredible and he loved the serving of blueberry jam that came with his meal. I loved my Mediterranian omelet. Both meals came with herbed potatoes that were a mix of sweet and regular potatoes. So good!  That accompanied with freshly squeezed orange juice and really good green tea made the perfect start in the day for us.  The service was exceptionally good and attentive. We loved our experience here,~Sternchen16~Munich, Germany
Andaluca~432630~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We just enjoyed breakfast here. It was quiet but very good food and the staff was friendly.  Stuffed French toast and hazelnut waffle were kids' favorites.  I had the veggie hash which was just the right amount of warm and hearty for a November morning.  ~Kristen C~Bayfield, Wisconsin
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A very large and bustling hot spot in the Pearl.  The menu features small plates (not really traditional tapas) and full entrees.  The offering is probably best characterized as nouvelle Peruvian.  We found the food very good to excellent but it was a bit expensive for what we had, especially for the small plates.  Everything is, of course, ala carte so even with a reasonably priced entree by the time you get a salad and one other side you are at $50+ for a dinner plus drinks, wine and desert.  The service was good but not exceptional.  If we had a complaint, it would be the crowding of tables and the incredible noise of having that many people jammed into a space.  It may appeal nicely to the hip set but for a couple of couple who want a nice dinner in a more intimate setting, one conducive to conversation, this is not the best pick.  By the way, the Peruvian beans were outstanding!~Jon B~Tualitin, Oregon
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~An amazing Peruvian food prepared with the heart and sole of the chef and kitchen staff who love what they do. Dishes are presented well decorated and so appetizing that you do not wish to stop. Ordering appetizers or main dishes it is always great food. I love ordering multiple appetizers to taste multiple varieties of well prepared food.~Hossien E~Corvallis, Oregon
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent happy hour specials with some great cocktails and wines. Happy hour food menu is excellent too.  I tried the beef heart and empenada.  Both excellent and where else can you get beef heart?  Beside the bar area is the restaurant itself.  It's basically the same except happy hour is in the bar only.  They still give you full access to the menu.  More searing downstairs too.   The menu is very long and includes a variety of meat and seafoods.  Vegetarian as well.  I had the yucca fries and octopus.   That along with a happy hour dish and the two of us had plenty to eat.   Around 8 pm the music started.  We were done eating so unfortunately missed it.  Next time I might try to time my visit around the music though.    Fantastic time with excellent food.  Great place for a date.  Doesn't matter if it's your first one or your 20th anniversary.~marcus k~San Francisco, California
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friends introduced me to this place, which features "novo peruvian" cuisine. We shared a number of dishes. The divers scallops were superb as were the chicken kabobs. The attentiveness to dipping sauces was evident, even with the chips that came with three sauces. The restaurant is lovely. Service was excellent.~sobaytravelguy~Santa Clara, CA
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been to Peru several times and the food at Andina was absolutely amazing! Their drinks are spectacular. Great ambiance in the bar area with live music. A must if you are in Portland.~SwedishVagabond~Encinitas, California
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're weary of salmon, crab and duck, try out Andina and you're in for a heavy dose of creativity. The Peruvian influence is strong, but the chef also mixes in flavors of the Northwest. We loved the empanadas, which benefited from exceptionally flaky crust. You can sample a number of small plates, tapas style, or share larger entrees. Don't skip dessert!~Thomas M~Mount Pleasant, South Carolina
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It is a tradition for my family to stop at Andina Restaurant every time we are in Portland (we live in Bend, OR). Being a proud Peruvian myself, it is great to taste the wonderful flavors of my country while away from home. The Pisco Sour at this restaurant is spectacular! Beef hearts, empanadas de carne, saltado de hongos , alfajores and everything else I am sure! Our one year old loved the food there too and she was welcomed with big smiles. Service was great!~tatianahav~Bend, Oregon
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the amazing food but not the noise/ overcrowded atmosphere! We had a reservation and still had to wait a long time to get seated. People were everywhere. It felt like not enough air in the restaurant. Not to be negative just stating the fact. Had live music which was a nice touch!~dominikapukay~Portland, Oregon
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Made reservations far in advance so we knew we had the night here.  Arrived a few minutes early, and we were promptly shown to our table.  No open tables for walk ins that night.  My wife and I had a Pisco Sour and a mojito--they were both excellent.  We love tapas, so had a variety of tapas for dinner, slowly working our way through, and then finished with a creme brulee trio.  Food was fantastic, and the service was excellent!!!  One of my favorite places to eat when we venture out to Portland! ~ghotai~Elkton, Oregon
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On this trip to Portland to visit my sister, we came here twice, we loved it so much! Everything we ordered was outstanding! The chicken kabobs, various chips and sauces, stuffed peppers with crab, chicken salad, shredded pork, it was all so good. I would highly recommend this place to everyone, Peruvian food here is well represented.  The service was great. The area is very nice. I loved it.~Ro G~Sj
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our 19 year old son requested dinner at Andina during his fall break.  Somehow, Opentable got the reservation wrong.  The staff suggested the bar but I reminded them that our son was 19.  They said that minors were ok in the lounge for dinner.  Dinner was spectacular.  Service was spectacular.  We tried a new dessert which is a trip of creme brulee.  Flavors were squash, vanilla and grapefruit.  I LOVED the grapefruit creme brulee.  There used to be bread served with 3 sauces delivered to all tables.  Now, the 3 sauces are available for order with a basket of chips from various plants such as yucca, sweet and purple potatoes.  Very tasty!  We'll be back!~nkwins~oregon
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Superlatives wouldn't do this amazing restaurant homage.  The Peruvian food is nothing short of awesome. The flavors are unusual but not too far out that you don't know if  you like it. Everything here was beyond. the Service, the physical restaurant, and the food, oh the food. We had the diver scallops, the call them something else I can't pronounce that were perfectly done with crispy quinoa. Sounds different, tastes wonderful. They come on a vegetable puree. She had the hit dish of the night, the pork chop. Oh my goodness, she made the mistake of sharing with me. I won't spoil the surprize but they come with something you may have to go on faith to try, and will be more than happy you did. Do not miss this place. They are hard to get into, so I tried calling and Open Table which there is a  trick too. Open Table is not given the prime times, call the restaurant also. Enjoy and tell those who you want to please!~ebcnaz~Seattle, Washington
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a happening place in town, and requires a reservation.  Quite loud inside, but food is wonderful. Portions are smaller, so for hearty eaters may require a appy.~cupperr~Seattle, Washington
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant was recommended by Port of Portland and we came here for dinner. Waiter was extremely knowledgeable and explained the menu in details. We had four course dinner and all dishes are great.~YTOAY~Ontario
Andina Restaurant~440005~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well prepared food, excellent service and a comfortable atmosphere. There are options on the menu for smaller portions. The Empanads are delicious and the sorbet was perfect.~john99801~Juneau, Alaska
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A great find on our way to the adirondacks.   We both had the lamb chops.  They were excellent, perfectly prepared and paired with a good California pinot noir.  The lemoncello cake desert was a perfect capper.  Our waiter, dan, was pleasant and accommodating.  I would definitely return and recommend to others. ~Ed K~Cheltenham
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Being our last night on the road, we wanted something a little nicer so we chose Aqua Vino. Arrived at 5:45 and got the last open table so make reservations.  The hotel is located on the Barge Canal--OK so it's not as dramatic as the Maine coast but it's as good as it gets in Utica. Kayla, our waitress  was on the ball. We were literally at the last table, farthest from the kitchen but she was all over us with her warm smile and good service. Her section was always under control.  We split the crab cake appetizer which we don't ordinarily order (unless we're in Maryland) as it can be hit and miss. At Aqua Vino, it was a hit as it was loaded with crab meat and prepared just right. A small salad was included which was fine and our entrees were also done perfectly. A totally enjoyable evening.    Word of warning: Entrees run from about $20 to $45 dollars and the specials can be in the $40's as well so check with your server before you order that 40 something veal chop so there are no surprises when you settle up.~RoadMaven~Long Island
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~During a visit to family in Utica, we had lunch at Aqua Vino.  The restaurant has a pretty outdoor dining area along the canal, but it was too hot and humid the day we were there.  So we sat inside and enjoyed our lunch in air-conditioned comfort.  The cocktails were good and the food was tasty.  I enjoyed a very large and fresh Cobb salad, while my wife liked her grilled haddock.  Worth a stop if you are in the area.~MauriceTheTourGuide~Oakland, California
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Extended family met here to celebrate my Uncle's life; he had passed away and this was his favorite restaurant. Growing up in an Italian family with high culinary expectations, I am sometimes weary when eating out. The veal parmigiana was on special and is my favorite personal dish; wow!!! This is the best veal I have eaten in a restaurant. Veal was a thick cut, but tender and perfectly prepared; sauce was excellent!!! Great wine selection and the Utica Greens were phenomenal!!! Definitely order the greens!!!~SAOC2010~Anderson, South Carolina
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place to eat the Tomahawk Steak was strange when it came to the table. It was like just as its sounds. Too funny but it was awesome! cooked perfect and eat every bit. Will be back again soon.~Manyfirststogether~Whitesboro, New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a family group there for special occasion on a muggy night and because of so many flies , we had to cover food , bread ... as it was delivered and eaten. We were shewing/killing flies as we  ate. One waitress ( nice of her) gave me a fly swatter. It was so distracting and bothersome that it spoiled the entire get -together for some. There was not even an offer for anything nor a bill reduction.  Also, seemed VERY pricey. Most restaurants would do something for patrons who had such an experience . So thanks to the management for the aforementioned!~dad1meister~Utica, New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are in Utica, NY and are looking for a great meal with terrific ambiance, look no further!  Aqua Vino is fantastic.  Someone recommended it to us and we were not disappointed.  Unfortunately, we were there on a very stormy evening, so I look forward to returning when in town on business again.~LPWNewYork~New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is great for special occasions.  Have eaten there many times and never once had a bad meal.~swtstuff~Utica, New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We found this restaurant on our way home from a relaxing Adirondack weekend, and we were not disappointed.  It was a warm night so we chose to be seated outside with a canal view. The tiki torches were a nice touch and made for a relaxing atmosphere on a busy night. I chose the Penne Santorini, which was full of flavor and served hot over a bed of pasta. My husband's Haddock Oreganato was moist and tender. We were eager to share tastes of our delicious dishes with each other.  Both entrees were accompanied by a cold fresh and crisp salad, as well as warmed bread with butter.  Service was excellent.  I love a restaurant where the service is great, and the cold foods are served cold, the hot foods are served hot and this hit the mark.  Add on the delicious flavors and ambiance, and it has become a new favorite.~Eatright2014~Syracuse, New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We go here frequently. Food is consistently good and staff is efficient and courteous. Had several fish dishes that are delicious and we love the greens!  Love the outdoor seating! ~Michele0101~Central New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We located this hidden restaurant with excellent food and we are more than pleased.   I had a salmon dish with a lot of character.   My husband had broiled haddock and was very happy.   Our waitress, Amanda, was caring and pleasant.   It is a very clean and cozy restaurant with affordable pricing.~Trupes~New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Aqua Vino last night; I had the Chicken Riggies and my girlfriend had the Chicken parmigiana. Both were excellent!!!  I asked for just a little "hot" for my Riggies (GERD) and that's exactly the way they came - favorful, but not too hot for me.  The service was extremely good. Our Waiter, Michael Gino, takes great pride in his service. He knows the menu well - he should - we found out he is the Chef's Son.  Michael also recommended a wonderful Zinfandel (Old Soul). It was a great Zin that I really enjoyed.  We went early on a Friday evening, sat inside and had a great dinner.  Wonderful food, attentive and professional staff, and some of the best Italian food you will find "anywhere".  Next time I go back I'm going to have one of my other two favorites at the Aqua Vino - be sure top try their Veal Parmigiana or the Veal Saltimbocca.    ~Frank W~New York
Aqua Vino Restaurant~1150305~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went there for a Birthday Dinner - were treated with great service by Gino, our Waiter.  The Veal Saltimbocca was excellent. I recommend it, it you like veal dishes.  For dessert we had the Lava Cake - WOW. I think I will go there another time and have that as a separate meal.  Aqua Vino is a great restaurant with very good quality and consistent food. Ask for Gino - he's the best.~Frank W~New York
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing experience here. We were lucky to grab a seat straight away, but we did go a little later. I love the late dining experience, staff were super friendly and helpful, food was incredible, pricing was fair.~Jane F~Dublin, Ireland
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Avec has great food.  Presentation is good.  There was only one draw back and that is the you may have to share a table - not really my thing.~Stacy S~Madison, Wisconsin
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Four of us enjoyed a relaxing business dinner at Avec and found it to be wonderful. The service was timely, the food excellent. I would recommend it for a quality dining experience.~mssrfoie~Chicago, Illinois
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been going to Avec for the past decade or so and have always had some of the freshest food there. The ambiance can be a bit loud because you basically share a long table among other guests and it is a small crowded space so it is best going there in company of friends. Avec is mid-range in terms of cost as it serves small to medium sized dishes similar to spanish tapas sized portions to larger fuller dishes. It is definitely worthy of a michelin star which its sister restaurant blackbird has, but i don't think is as good. Try it and you will not regret it. Its kale salad is wonderful, they serve great medjoul dates wrapped in bacon, and fresh market fish, as well as lovely affordable wines.~HT0375~Chicago
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I took my 3 daughters here for lunch and it was busy from the time we arrived. I had the pork shoulder which was excellent, my one daughter had the hummus with pita which was also excellent. My other two daughters ordered the French toast and neither cared for it. The bread of the French toast seemed to have an orange liqueur in it and the topping had what tasted like a bourbon sauce. So it was not remotely close to a traditional French toast which is ok, but my girls didn't care for it nor was I crazy about it. The lunch menu is more limited than the dinner one so I would give the dinner a try for sure but possibly without my daughters.~JLFrazier5~Evansville, Indiana
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was recommended to try Avec after talking with a colleague on how great my meal was at Publican.  He thought this would be another great restaurant that has a small plate approach with the focus on food tastes and not being pretentious!  He was absolutely right.  One of my favourite dishes came from here and I would happily come back to see if it's on the menu.  We were told the menu rotates often and though they do have some standards (the dates!!)... it changes often so don't expect to see the same menu even a month later.  It is a small restaurant with the actual kitchen among the diners.  We sat along the bar instead of the communal tables and got a great view of the chefs at work.  We were given a nice introduction to their top dishes and we composed a VERY filling dinner.  Everyone working in the restaurant is in constant motion.. whether it be clearing plates, cooking, taking an order, or serving... it's a constant hustle.  It gives a great vibe to the place.  We started off with the sprout salad (love the flavours and texture... crispy sweet apple slices with a hit of mustard, and crunch and nuttiness of peanuts), calamari (my fellow diner was really hesitant on calamari.. he thinks rubber bands. Turns out this was a great dish and now he's open to having it again.  They were tender and the lime citrus note was good), chorizo dates (very good... love the sweetness hits you first then the paprika and pork flavour comes afterwards.  LOVED the sauce... we used all the bread to sop it up), paella (WARNING this is a LARGE portion.  Like more than enough for 2 people... we're talking probably 4.  it came with 5 large head on shrimp and 3 chicken legs... plus a ton of crispy bottom rice.  Great dish but damn we were stuffed), and ended with kumquat flan (LOVE this... my dining partner thought this might be too eggy and it was more like creamy milky heaven... the caramel was so good).   We did over order but wow, great flavours and execution.  I love the constant changing menu and how it does offer a variety of vegetables, seafood, and meats... not just a constant focus on red meats.  For those of us who like to eat more vegetables, Avec will be a constant on my list of places to eat in Chicago.~ACartier~Toronto, Canada
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It reminds me on tapas Spanish type of restaurant. The food is fresh and portions are on smaller side, but could be overcrowded, because reservation is not necessary. It is definitely not WOW, but In any way it is worth of money...price vs. quality of food...~Sasha B~St. Louis, United States
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Met a colleague here for an early dinner. We shared four small plates and each one was a walk through a forest of flavors. Attentive staff. Nice wine list. Although choices by the glass are few, there are some excellent options. The only negative (for some) is the communal table seating. Sitting at the bar is slightly more private but has flat wooden seats with no backs. Reservations are a must. This is a small-ish restaurant with an exposed kitchen; it's amazing that the chefs and cooks work from such a confined space.~TXRoadWarrior~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Saw this as good choice on a Chicago day trip additions to my business trip. It was all that the reviews had indicated. Great staff. Good food. ~awesomegal~Vienna, Virginia
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Chorizo Stuffed Dates are a must. Farro and Sweet Corn Salad were great. Will definitely make a return visit.~Frodogg1~Cleveland, Mississippi
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Traveled to Chicago with friends to attend their son's wedding. Arrived in town late and hungry. Their son recommended Avec to us. Delightful small plates shared by all six of us. Great selection of beverages. Service was top notch. They are open late. Couldn't be happier with the total package. ~Mike M~Olympia, Washington
Avec~427779~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We managed to squeeze in early before the crowds which turned out to work in our favour. The food was amazing, if you eat meat the chorizo filled dates are a must. The service was fantastic and the waitress was knowledgeable about the wine too. I would definitely recommend a visit here.~CAppleby~London, United Kingdom
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A great meal and the service was impeccable.  Our server didn't hover, but always kept our beverages filled and the table cleared.~bar3115~Anchorage, Alaska
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After our disappointing Breakfast At Sweetgrass Bacco was wonderful. Very busy establishment but we managed to get a table for 4 on the footpath. Great food, good staff and close to the markets.Recommende~William A~Auckland, New Zealand
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Busy Cafe, but worth the short wait- great food & service - nice brunch variety, excellent coffee & drinks~Carlton T~Cooper City, Florida
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here for breakfast on a Monday morning. Wait was about 10 minutes because the outdoor seating was closed. There wasn't a sign visible that said please wait to be seated. So we walked in and sat down and then we were told he couldn't sit there. A bit confusing. Multiple people did the exact same thing while I was there.  As for the food...I got the breakfast plate. It came with eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. It literally came with 1 piece of toast. I have never ever seen that anywhere. Also, asked for my bacon crispy/burnt and it was limp and not burnt at all.  I probably wont go back again. I'm not sure if everyone loves this place because of the food or because there really isn't many places near by that have a basic breakfast.~Michaela D~Sunnyvale, California
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had breakfast here. Took the crab Benedict. Liked it a lot. Fresh juice was also very nice. Could probably eat breakfast here everyday, so I'd highly recommend it for breakfast.~Dani H~Tel Aviv, Israel
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I came in shortly after 7:00 on a Sunday morning and was the first customer there. I was out again by 7:45. The best part was the fresh squeezed juice- orange, pineapple and pear. Delicious. I had the crab eggs Benedict and I came to realize that I just don't like crab that much. There was a generous portion of crab atop each muffin half, with the smallest piece of avocado. The eggs were poached perfectly medium. There were just a couple of teaspoons of hollandaise sauce on top of each egg. The most notable flavor in all of this was the crab. So if you love crab, this would be a good dish for you. If you only like crab in, say, crab cakes (like I do) then you better order something else.~730jane~Iowa City, Iowa
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had some lovely toasted bread, with herbs, and homemade jam. Service was good and it was a nice, inviting place to start a day. It felt very French and quaint.~Chevy S~Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you want a breakfast restaurant that is simple and delicious, this is the place! The first time I ate here, I had the Dungeness crab Benedict. When the plate was sat in front of me, I immediately thought that there was not enough hollandaise sauce. Once I took a bite, the big chunks of crab did not need any more sauce. This dish showcased the crab! Micah, the server, was a soft spoken gentleman that brightened the morning. The second time I visited this restaurant, I chose the French toast special. Two huge pieces of French toast with fresh strawberries and blueberries were on the side made up this order. The fresh, warm maple syrup tied the dish together to make a combination that melts in your mouth. The server, Ciara, had a contagious smile and welcoming personality. If you are looking for a quaint breakfast place with delicious food and awesome service, Bacco should make your list. ~Jacqueline S~Mesa, Arizona
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for a lovely, whimsical breakfast dining experience near the water and Pike's, look no further! The staff was delightful, but paled in comparison to the food. oh my! The salmon hash is my recommendation!~Samantha G~Omaha, Nebraska
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I had breakfast here, and it was very good.  A small place, and sometimes difficult to get in, it was recommended to us by downtown hotel staff when we were just walking around looking for a place to sit and eat.  My friend had the biscuits and gravy, which were delicious, and I had the breakfast sandwich, which was also good.  Enormous servings for the prices.  And they make all of their own fresh juices and juice mixes.  I had a mimosa with fresh orange juice, and my friend had the carrot juice blend.  Both of us ordered them twice.  Well worth the visit if you can get a table as it is located quite near Pike Place Market.  ~gaveston71~Louisiana
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Needed breakfast to set ourselves up for first day in city.  Looked for place used by locals. Busy when arrived at 1pm but soon had table.  Good menu and food hit the spot although only after having to ask for both meals to be heated up as they were only warm when first served. Felt pricey but this may be tinged by current exchange woes from the UK.  Quality could not be faulted.  Would visit again if staying longer.~addsup2nick~London, United Kingdom
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not fancy, but just good food and great service....... plus champagne brunch  is always a good way to start the day!!~culturebound~los angeles
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The staff are friendly and welcoming.  Breakfast was crab omelettes.  They were cooked absolutely perfectly.  There are so few places that cook omelettes correctly these days.  The egg was light and fluffy.  No surprise, the coffee is great as well.~FuzzyBeaver~Montreal, Canada
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is very popular. If you go on the weekend and get there after 8:00, expect a wait. The food is good but beware that it's pricey for breakfast food. I was in the mood for oatmeal when I went. Granted they did serve it with a nice medley of fruit, but $8 is high for oatmeal. The side of sausage was $5. If price is no concern then go by all means. If you're trying to budget then head over to the crumpet shop a block away.~valorrmac~Cincinnati, Ohio
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stayed at the Inn at the Market, our room is two floors above Bacco.  We had to wait for 15 mins for a table and were happy to sit outside, we enjoyed having the cool breeze and also good to watch people walking past.  The food was of a good size without being over the top huge. I had the dungenous egg benedict with added bacon on the side. It was delicious. The freshly squeezed juices they have are very refreshing. Unfortunately, being a Melburnian, we have yet to find a place that makes a decent coffee.  ~brettnjess~Melbourne, Australia
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here as soon as we got into town. I had the Dungeness Crab Benedict, which was absolutely phenomenal.  My daughter had the brioche French toast, equally amazing with a maple butter. One of the best cappuccinos I've ever had. Great service.  ~Sherri B~Frisco, Texas
Bacco~432704~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were suggested Bacco for breakfast. We went, we waited, we tried, and we were underwhelmed. The food was generally basic breakfast fare. I was mostly disappointed by my 'vegetable' skillet that was mostly white potatoes. Was not worth the price, wait, or hype in my opinion. ~Charlie Y~Tampa, Florida
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A tour guide from the Kennedy Center recommended this place for desert and coffee and he was spot on.  I ordered two cupcakes - german chocolate and red velvet.  My daughter also ordered two, but I only recall one that had bacon bits on top of frosting (I was too into eating my red velvet). The frosting is superb, just the right cream cheese consistency with a mild sugar flavor.  I would have like a more chocolaty flavor to the red velvet, but it was very moist.  The size was good, but coming from Chicago the prices seem high to me.  Something like $16 for the two.  I love german chocolate cake and this didn't disappoint.  On point with the coconut frosting and cake was sooo good.  I ate dessert first as they were closing, then moved on to dinner.  But my tummy was so happy, that I needed a doggie bag for dinner.~JABRAKO~Huntley, Illinois
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cost 3.75 per cupcake, which is similar to price Georgetown Cupcake and Sprinkles. Very well made, perfect combination of sweet and creamy. I bought these cupcakes for bridal shower. Most of guest were not disappointed. ~RaeshellJoye~Southfield, Michigan
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the vibe of this place. Amazing baked goods and coffee. Staff is very friendly. It's really a fun place to hang and eat and drink coffee. ~COLWF~Atlanta, Georgia
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's standard that you have to wait on the sidewalk outside to get in but it's worth the wait. Once you get inside the service is quick and friendly. The selections are interesting(6 cupcakes with fruit flavored cake, 6 chocolate,6 vanilla). There is little space to sit and eat but that's also expected I didn't try it but the coffee shop on the other side of the wall is good but nothing exceptional according to my son.~Glennithy~Plum, Pennsylvania
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love these cake cups.  Tourists go.to Georgetown cupcakes, locals go to baked and wired.  This place rocks.  Great selection and tasty desserts even if you aren't a cupcake fan.  Try these.  They're fantastic and won't be disppointed.  Go early to avoid the lines.~atarzia~Belize
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My DC children recommended the bakery for my daughters bridal shower. Researched and decided that these were the only Georgetown cupcakes worthy of the event . They did not disappoint and neither did the biscotti's. We feasted on the flavors that day and well into the weekend . With extras treated my colleagues this week . The frosting was perfect and the cupcake itself was the main event. Really do not like overwhelming frosting with minimal cake presentation .Theses treats were above and beyond . Ordering ahead of time was a breeze the local shop provided a wonderful fall walk to their store with prompt attention easy pick up! Highly recommend !!!~swatson9~Charlotte, North Carolina
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I visited for cupcakes and espresso. There are long lineups, but the wait is worth it. The food and coffee are excellent. ~Robert S~Toronto, Canada
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really good breve latte.  Not much seating.  Place gets crowded rapidly with a line out the door.  Had banana nut bread that was excellent.  Noisy and limited seating in the morning, so it is not great for reading or relaxing.  ~John R~Mobile, Alabama
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by early afternoon on a Saturday from a recommendation from a local couple the night before. It was hoppin and had about 20 kinds of cupcakes and many other pastries. I grabbed a Chai flavored cupcake with coffee icing to eat later that afternoon. The cupcake was moist and delicious and the coffee icing pulled it together perfectly. It also came in a very cute little box to go. Great alternative to the other touristy cupcake shop in Georgetown.~btyson11~Mishawaka, Indiana
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There may be a line but the cupcakes are so good! They even have vegan ones. Great place for coffee too! ~Lily_rosenberg~West Bloomfield, Michigan
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have cupcakes, and I am sure they are good, but the biscuits are where it is at! Coffee is also great!~Benjamin H~Kennesaw, Georgia
Baked and Wired~456607~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is my favorite now for a birthday cake - a box of varied flavors cupcakes from Baked and Wired.  People always oooh and aaaaaah.   The flavors are so creative and so unusual.  There are many cupcakes shops to choose from --- I 've tried them all and always they fall short of Baked and Wired --- and I so I return to where I started years ago.  Baked and Wired.  They just can't be beat.~JKLS333~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Coming from the Chicago area where good neighborhood bakeries are cherished it was a pleasant surprise to find this jewel in West Seattle.  Located right on California in the heart of the CBD it has a wide and ever changing selection of pastries, breads, macaroons, croissant sandwiches, coffee and more...  Try the double-baked almond croissant which has a light flaky texture covered in powdered sugar with a rich almond filling!!  It will make you smile for the rest of the day!  I have tried the quiche, chocolate croissant, various breads, breakfast sandwiches, and cookies without disappointment.  In addition, the service is excellent and efficient even when there is a line.  Sitting areas inside as well as outside.~bubinask~Kenosha, Wisconsin
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Crunchy on the outside while moist and creamy on the inside. Delicious! Not the kind that has almond paste medicine-like taste. Just freshly baked deliciousness. You might think you can find it in every other french bakery, but not as good as this one!~emendem323~Newport Beach, California
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First, when you walk in the delicious aromas will surround you, then you hear the cases of sweets and savories calling to you Bonus: the visual of their pastries.. .. beyond words!  Last because you can't wait any longer the taste;  Sell my clothes I'm going to heaven, followed by a deep satisfying sigh.~buttonjunkie~Seattle, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Found this bakery by google while I was in Seattle for just a couple of hours on Sunday morning. Place was small with few table for eat in, customers are keep coming there non-stop. Tried 3 sandwiches and pear tart and 4 pastries. They all looked wonderful and tasted very good. Each sandwich has great amount of ingredients. Cake and pastries are not too sweet and very fresh. And I also ordered a soy latte which was very very good.  I can say sandwiches are just a little salty for me, but I enjoyed their creative ingredients on each sandwiches. I recommend to any of my friend if they have vehicle to get there.~aypowell~fairbanks
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friends from out of town knew of this incredible bakery in West Seattle. Ended up going three times in one week. Never tried the same thing more than once and everything was beautiful to look at and unbelievably delicious. There was a line out the door at all times but the wait was barely noticable; the line moved right along. Staff were all helpful, pleasant and well able to deal with volume. Selections from loaves of bread, pizza, cakes,torts, pies, sandwicies, cookies, and an astounding array of pastries I can neither pronounce nor spell but which were delicious and beautiful. The Lemoncello cake was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten. Parking was easy and free on thr street. More than worth a trip.~Gail S~Seattle, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I do go to other bakeries in Seattle but I keep returning to both of Bakery Nouveau's location.  This one is in West Seattle.  If you go on a weekend there is often a line out the door and for good reason.  The sandwich's and quiche are very good as well.~Alec D~Seattle, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have to quote another reviewer:  "The hardest thing is deciding and you cannot go wrong ".  Although they say they are a bakery, their sandwiches and pizzas are great!  Its as close to going to a Patisserie in France.~Chrystine K~Seattle, Washington, United States
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the twice baked chocolate croissants.  They are flaky and delicious!  When I want to celebrate a friend's birthday I always buy their cake here - absolutely the  most decadent and best.  Their cakes definitely take the sting out of aging another year.~wajody~Seattle, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Looking for lunch, we ended up in West Seattle at Bakery Nouveau. Could have ordered one of each, but I didn't. A California Club (pictured), an almond croissant, an almond twisty thing with jam in the middle and some chocolate bread (for my son). They were all amazing. I'd travel there for a shot at just one of them, let alone all of them.   You can't go wrong at Bakery Nouveau. Go!  Enjoy!!~Chad-a-Lack~Puyallup, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely and imaginative baked goods, both sweet (all sorts of croissants and other yummies) and savory (delicious ham & cheese croissants, among others), good coffee. Two locations, the original one in West Seattle and the newer one on Capitol, which we usually frequent now because it's much closer for us, somewhat less crowded, we think, and also a calmer, more pleasant space.~Victoria B~Seattle, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So the first time I went to this bakery it was because it was rated in the top 5 restaurants in Seattle by Zagat's so I drove in the pouring rain to West Seattle and got the amazing croissants. They were so good that I drove there every morning I was there. I never go to Seattle without making a trip to this bakery and a friend just brought a dozen almond croissants back to me, cross country. Even day old croissants from this bakery beat out anything outside of France.~SBHTravels~Miami, Florida
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is impressive and the coffee is just perfect .  Staff very helpful and very courteous .  You have to visit , anything you order will be outstanding .  ~bsborunda~Texas
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pastries & sandwiches are fantastic.  I believe it is the best almond croissant in Seattle.  But their espresso drinks are downright a waste of $$.   Which is really a shame that you cannot go in & get a great coffee & a croissant together.~Tras44~Seattle, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The smell is seducing but wait until you bite into the twice baked almond croissant. There is no place you'd rather be! We also had the pistachio cassis and chocolate croissant. Everything is the best I've ever had!~Debbie L~Greater Melbourne, Australia
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The worst part about this place is trying to decide what to get.  Their creations are not only delicious, but wonderfully crafted.  I also felt that the prices were exceptional for the quality of their goods.  Highly recommended.~kingedward29~Michigan
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is like a little bit of Paris in Seattle! We popped in to the Capitol Hill branch for croissants and coffee. Everything is baked in house and the displays are absolutely mouth watering. We tried a spinach croissant and the twice baked almond croissant and both were utterly delicious. The coffee was awesome and the staff friendly. This place gets really busy and there are only a few tables inside, so be prepared to sit outside or take your baked beauties away with you!~pddownunder~Sydney
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in for a snack while in West Seattle and loved to EuroFresh atmosphere! It's a small bakery with a delightful pastry selection.~VashonRR~Vashon, Washington
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Worth standing in line!   Outstanding baked goods and incredible coffee.  Love their flaky criossants!!~Ken P~Seattle
Bakery Nouveau~788105~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can never go wrong here! Sweet or savory. Light or rich. My favorite is the caramello slice. Perfect blend of flavors and textures!~Mary Beth D~Seattle, Washington
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~6 of us went for a late dinner. Service was slow and the place wasn't crowded - maybe some of the servers or cooks went home early? We had cocktails which varied in quality and the cornbread (excellent) and spinach dip (average) for appetizers. All of the dinners were very good - served hot and tasty. Prices were high but typical for downtown.~Craig D~Missouri
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First time here. Really nice decor, great feeling inside, with good live Jazz. The menu is very interesting. We tried several items- Cornbread had great flavor, but dry and didn't hold together. Salads were very good, but way overdone with sauces. Chicken and Ribs are awesome. So sort of mixed bag. This is a great place to spend an evening, but I think the 5 star food reviews are way over rated.~Courtney B~Park City, Utah
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I enjoy Bandera as my go to for business meetings.  Food is good and service is great.  I would highly recommend.~mkbloom~New York
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was really excited to go to Bandera. The jazz band and wine selection was excellent. The food was a solid good but not great or exceptional. Overall, I got the impression that this is more a bar scene than a high end restaurant. We had a pre-teen with us and I had the impression the waitress could not wait to get us out of there by the end. The menu is limited!~hasmar2016~Memphis, Tennessee
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Im doing no breads or fried foods and just had the Macho salad with dates and almonds! The ambience is a great wind down to shopping.~REIKE P~Chicago, United States
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was my first-ever time in Chicago and my friend found this restaurant because it was close by, highly rated and reasonably priced. Surprise me. We had to kill two hours before our reservation and they took us in right when we showed up and it was busy. Good first impression. The place is like a second floor mezzanine with relatively low ceilings, it feels busy (it has an extensive sports bar) and they put us a a table near the windows and a (excellent) live Jazz trio playing near our table. Still we could hold a conversation without having to yell at each other. The waiter was excellent from the get-go, experienced, polite and in command. I had the cod with mash potatoes, broccoli, minced with lobster crunchy bits. It was simple, tasty, and very satisfying. Desert was the best apple crumble I have ever had, period. They're usually way too sweet for my taste but this one was perfection. Topped with walnuts, thank you. Overall, a great experience. Elegant, casual, lively, unpretentious, and very good. I'd go back without any hesitation. I love Chicago.~FrancisK~Honolulu
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Live music, immediate sitting, good food, reasonable price!  Give it a try and enjoy a little atmosphere at great location!~Scott T~Morton, Illinois
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My 10 year old son and I stopped in for a dinner for two.  I had my usual ahi tuna salad- but this time the salad portion was very tiny. Flavors and presentation all wonderful.  My son had the burger and it was fantastic!   Recommendation: skim milk should be available.   Love this place.  Can't wait to come back! ~221PaulC~Glen Ellyn, Illinois
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seemed a little over-rated. Rotisserie chicken is solid but nothing amazing. The "signature" cornbread was dry and tasteless compared to what a Southerner like me is used to. It was a decent dinner but didn't blow my mind by any means.~Nick M~Winston Salem, North Carolina, United States
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This second floor restaurant is a great place to stop in for dinner if you're downtown. The ambiance and music make you forget you're on the magnificent mile. The food was delicious and high quality for the price which was reasonable for downtown.~northshorenancy2016~Chicago, Illinois
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited October 16th with an old friend. We equally loved the atmosphere, the location, the view and the food. I had a French dip sandwich which was excellent and my friend had a Burger. We shared a corn bread appetizer. Overall the food was excellent. The corn bread was beautiful but a bit dry. The service was very good but a bit pushy. I should say I wouldn't complain about the service except to say I wasn't in a rush. I will certainly repeat and while I was there for lunch I would recommend Bandera for Dinner or drinks at night. It is a beautiful restaurant and bar.~Kevin L~Boston, Massachusetts
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We definitely are Bandera Lovers ! After the one in LA, the one in Scottsdale, we finaly tried the one in Chicago !  Try the meat : fabulous. The restaurant is located in the famous Michigan Avenue (Mag Mile), on the 1st floor.  We appreciated the live music and the food. The cocktails were great. Staff was caring and sensitive to our demands.~soxinette~strasbourg
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Worth the visit; a nice oasis close to our hotel. The jazz duo that night was great and it was very nice to sit and listen to live music. That is a rare treat in this day, to hear live music while you eat. My salad was good, my husband had the Seattle Salmon and would give it five stars. My minor beef was an ingredient not listed in the menu was in my salad and unfortunately was a deal breaker, so I had to send it back. Make a reservation. We were not there on a busy night and people were being turned away or told over an hour's wait. ~Hope556~Madison, Wisconsin
Bandera Restaurant~427764~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yeah, possibly the Best salmon dinner I've had. Having not been before, and that being a birthday night, I checked out their own website for the menu. From there I got more of an impression that it was a burger place, which I was fine with, just saying...when we arrived, you have to take an escalator up one level off of Michigan Ave, it's sort of right across the street from the NorstromsMall. So you enter into a good looking bar, which after work on a Friday night, in Chicago, was swinging. Could have also been that they have a WorldClass Jazz trio playing, something like from 6 til 10. The wait staff is dressed in black, which causes them to blend into the shadows of a very handsomely done up interior. A lot of booths, along with tables along the front windows looking out onto MichiganAve. Our waitress was very good, understanding that some folks like to mix and match. Meaning while the salmon comes with mashed potatoes and brocolli, I preferred the image of spinach and roasted red and yellow peppers, she too was cool with that and the kitchen accommodated me. Another couple opted to split the salmon dish, along with fries and the peppers, and out fourth enjoyed the soup of the day, a black bean chili sort of bowl, and the Pine Salad, which was a heaping portion, but not so overwhelming for one person. They comp't the dessert dish, a wonderful walnut and apple crisp with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream sitting in the middle of it. They have a nice wine list, with many coming in glasses, for reasonable prices. I highly recommend checking this place out, if you are more in the mood for a burger then think about their veggie burger, just a thought... Regarding the Menu, if I owned this place I would change the layout of the menu. Reading down from Starters to Soups and Salads I'd go to their delicious main meals, then onto the Sandwiches. Through my eyes I had the impression we were going to more of a SportsBar, this is Not that, and definitely not when you factor in the fine Jazz. Ciao for now, Salida1048~Salida1048~Salida, Co. USA
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A few days ago a couple friends and I sat outside on a lovely Wednesday evening and we fell in love with the dynamic duo Jackie and Gigi they took care of us all night long! We ended up staying longer than we planned because the jokes, drinks, food were flowing all night. Thanks again ladies we will definitely be back! ~LHornet34~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Avery well located place with very nice view to the circle with nice food and drinks,    We had lobster soup and salmon where both were gourmet, plates are small but perfect size for who is looking for light dinner beside his drinks~Hani A~Jerusalem, Israel
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Bar Dupont at the Dupont Circle Hotel is a great location to meet DC friends or for a drink with out of town friends.  You can't miss it - literally on the edge of Dupont Circle.  The inside part of the bar has amazing views of the Circle, and on a nice evening, the outdoor section is great - and dog-friendly.~John W~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Bar Dupont had excellent service and great drinks. Highly recommended.   Quinn particularly was very helpful in answering questions and extremely accommodating. Would visit again.~jasonmarler~Indianapolis, Indiana
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I got off the train at Dupont Circle, admired the small park bench area, then set out to find the place where I was meeting a friend. I couldn't find it, she was delayed and I was famished, so I ran right into Cafe Dupont and I was not disappointed. I sat on the bar side, at a window seat, so I could charge my phone. It was quaint and even though the bar was there, it was still pretty quiet. I ordered the Fish & Chips, which were delicious!! I loved the Ginger beer too. Though the atmosphere was good and my waiter was friendly, I overheard a disagreement between the workers (waiter and supervisor). It was unprofessional and should have been take care of in the back, away from the customers. That's why I'm giving it a 4, but otherwise, I really enjoyed it and would come back. I hope I'll be back when it's warm, as the outside area looks very inviting.~FrugaliciousDiva~NW Ohio
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had an interminable lunch here because I could never find a waiter - I even went looking for one three times. My salmon and crabmeat sandwich with sweet potato fries was very good; I wish I could have had something to drink with it but no one came to take an order for beverages ... pathetic. If you need to get some place, don't eat here - the same goes for the hotel restaurant!~Constant_traveller45~New York City, New York
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was there with couple friends celebrating a birthday and we had A BLAST!!!!! We had plenty of drinks and food. Midsummer Night was such a delicious cocktail we drank them all night. Gigi and Jackie made the suggestions and they really took care of us. The ambiance was perfect!!! Gotta visit this spot right off the Dupont Circle!!!!~DVTrevor~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a lovely place inside and out, but...  I'd been wanting to try Bar Dupont for quite awhile and finally had the opportunity to do so when the fiance had a meeting there. I met him after his meeting, sitting down at his table at 6:05 pm. At 6:10, I called over one of the two servers who'd been waiting on them, asking if he would wipe off the table and advising him that we wanted to place a dinner order.  At 6:25, the fiance called over the other server (because the first one disappeared) who'd been serving them and asked her to take our order. At 6:40 pm the food came but my drink still had not. When when we inquired about it, we were told that it is a pre-batch and they were waiting for it to be brought upstairs.  At $13 a glass, I do not want to hear that my cocktail is a "pre-batch".  This isn't happy hour, the drink isn't $6 and hopefully not rail!  I had ordered carrot ginger soup which is supposed to come with bread. Mine didn't. I tried to get a server's attention to bring it, but it took a few minutes and once I finally did get to tell her, it took another 10 minutes after that to get the bread.  By the time it came, the fiance had finished his steak sandwich (made I believe with NY Strip and a horseradish sauce, which was quite good) and my soup (which had a very strong ginger taste, but was otherwise rather bland) had already turned cool.  Overall I was very disappointed with our experience at Bar Dupont, as it has been one of our worst dining experiences in DC thus far. They get one star for the decor and one for the steak sandwich.~Sue F~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by this place on post-conference evening during a business trip.  I got there about ten minutes before the end of happy hour, but I wasn't given HH options or pricing, even though I ordered HH items.  Not a huge deal, but it's definitely not the kind of service you expect at a place like this.   I also wasn't offered a menu at all.    I did finally order a good draft beer, and I got the roasted Shishito peppers.  It was delicious and nicely presented, and the price was totally reasonable.  I would give this place another try, but I was by no means impressed.~NevadaJake~Sparks, Nevada
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by to meet friends for a pre dinner drink, The bar itself is very swanky. Glass floor to ceiling windows looking out on the hoi polloi and DuPont Circle. The drinks were very good and that makes them expensive. Something must have been going on on our Saturday night visit to add to out frustrations. So perhaps it was an off night. There are other haunts in DC without expensive drinks and bad service. Other than that the location is great and the aesthetics impressive.~james h~Acworth, Georgia
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The bar is beautiful, with glass windows looking at Dupont Circle. It was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday and perhaps that's why the service was not outstanding. It wasn't bad, but perfunctory. I had the Midsummer Night drink and it was delicious.   ~Liza R~San Juan, Puerto Rico
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a vibrant neighborhood bar with a nice happy hour and really good food!  I had excellent service, a great chilean red wine and fabulous mussels.  I hear their hamburgers are also great with truffle oil infused fries.  Prices were very reasonable for the quality.  Highly recommend.~Teresa E~Houston, Texas
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited the bar at the Dupont Circle Hotel during our trip to DC. We had a very enjoyable experience and the food and drinks were very good.   Blair was our server, she had a very lovely personality and was very informative!   Will definitely recommend for friends traveling to DC! ~Sophie T~Lyon, France
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were stuck in the hotel during the snow storm. Where better to hang out then in the bar ?? The bartenders were awesome, the drinks were great as well. Great atmosphere . I would love to get stuck there again !~Felice S~Baltimore, Maryland
Bar Dupont~4587338~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~i stayed at the hotel where this bar is located. good for quick drinks, nice ambience and prices are mid range~rmalik2015~New Delhi, India
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing cocktails with molecular chemistry elements. It was a fun experience. Too bad we could only get the last reservation, which didn't leave us enough time to try the flight. I'll definitely go back for the flight.~JLIO-TA~Ottawa
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~BEST.... PLACE.... EVER!!! We were visiting Washington for a long weekend. Tried to pick out some good places to eat and stumbled upon Barmini. So glad I did! I recommend doing the drink flight. It will give you the best visual and best tasting experience. Everyone that works there is friendly and knowledgeable.~Beth K~New Smyrna Beach, Florida
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great ambiance, delicious cocktails and awesome bartenders. I went back on another night by myself and also had a great time. ~Liza R~San Juan, Puerto Rico
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like cocktails and are visiting Washington DC, make sure to book this really special cocktail bar. Not just drinks. It is a real experience. I recommend sitting up at the bar, as then you can watch your personal bartender making the cocktails and ask questions about the unusual ingredients. The waffle was also amazing. To call it a bar snack does not do it justice. A really fun two hours and worth every penny~Michele B~Guildford, United Kingdom
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My bf chose this place to celebrate 3 yrs together and bar made it extra special. Let me start out by saying if you want to experience this place, you will be making reservations at least 2 weeks in advance AND be sure to sit at the bar!!  At first, I did not understand why it would take so long to get a reservation, but after this visit, I totally get it!! It is like fine dining, but for drinks. What makes this place so perfect and different from the average bar is the personal bartender you have during your 1-2 hr time there. And watching them prepare your drink is like watching a chef prepare the perfect meal. It is utterly amazing. From the smoke to the spraying (from what looked like the old-fashion perfume spray bottles). While the drinks are great, the preparation us what makes the place the most fun.  There are so many drinks you can taste and we wish we had the time to do the 2 hr cocktail treat. But for the hour or so we spent there, we were able to try 3 different drinks. Each one never disappointed (especially given we had the bartender choose them for us). It is rare to go to a bar and not walk away with a favorite.   We didn't really eat here, but I did order the liquid olive and a grilled cheese. Neither was what I was expecting at all. Both were really good and that liquid olive was interesting. So whether you come for drinks or come for food, the conversation will be never ending as you watch some of the most amazing drinks put together.~blackindimex~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My partner and I were visiting from NYC for my birthday. We run cocktail bars in the UK and were keen to check out what DC had to offer, Barmini did not let us down.   The fantastic bartender JP looked after us so well and even made me an off menu birthday drink. This guy clearly understand his liquors and is super attentive to boot.  If you're into your cocktails this is the place to check out. Great job guys, I'm sure we'll be back sometime soon :)~Sara S~London, United Kingdom
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not to be confused with Minibar, though housed right next door, is Jose Andres' unique version of a cocktail bar. Which, may I say, looks and feels like you are in someone's home. The seating area is set up like a living room- well, a living room on acid. And there is an open cocktail 'kitchen'. The drinks of course are going to cost and arm and a leg, but they are worth it. They are inventive, eye-catching, and well-made. There is a limited snack food/ bar bites menu so you can try such wonderful creations as foieffle (foie gras waffle). Reservations are essential as seating is limited and it is insanely popular.~FEEDMEMORE27~Yonkers, New York
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ok so this raises bartending to an art form. At $65 pp the flight is a no brainer. DO IT! Don't even think. Be prepared to be overwhelmed. Perfect half sized cocktails to share. Bartenders are very knowledgeable and skilled craftmen. Let them take you for a ride of a lifetime and be prepared to hold on. Food is very good but expensive. Get the waffle flight. Yes there's smoke and fire but so very much worth it. There were a lot of people sayin "Next time I'll order..." Yes there will be a next time even at $250 for two people. Extraordinary experience.~Normienorm~Huntingdon, Pennsylvania
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Order one of the flight specials and settle in for 2-4 hours of delight. The drinks are a feast for the eyes and palette, mixed with meticulous attention to detail right in front of you. Fun and enjoyable time, great for a birthday.~FociFutsal~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sit at the bar and order a flight of cocktails; you won't be disappointed. The drinks are otherworldly and amazing, the preparation is top-knot have, and the atmosphere is classy-meets-entertaining. This place is definitely worth visiting for a date or with friends.~FociFutsal~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant was more an experiment of Art meets food and not of Satiating my palate.  You know what your getting into as far as price and you must be a daring foodie to enjoy the meals.  I was impressed with the preparation and the knowledge of the staff, the food, not so much.  I really needed more substance.  My husband and I purchased the wine paring as well.  I would always recommend that option.  The cocktails are well worth re-visiting as well.~Atheo1~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was such a neat place!  Be sure to make reservations though or you'll have to wait a while. Our server wasn't the friendliest which was a little disappointing, but we had some great drinks and it was definitely worth the trip!  Ask for recommendations from the server. Yummy!~chelly12364~Henderson, Nevada
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Truly feels like you are in a bar laboratory.  Our only disappointment is that we didn't have a seat at the bar area, we were on a side table so couldn't see as much as you would if closer.  Request a bar seat when making a reservation if you only have 2pp.  What I loved the most is the meticulous detail making sure each drink had the proper glassware to enhance the flavor.  Also the mix of super modern with antique.  We had 4 different drinks between 2 people and each was unique and amazing!! What a fantastic experience.  Cant wait to try MiniBar next. ~marisaf-SC~Charleston, SC
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unique experience- we sat at the bar in front of Miguel. He was one of the mixologists in training and he did an amazing job. He knew the recipes and was able to answer all our questions very well. (We had many questions) We had a wonderful time enjoying six different cocktails. I love the environment and how much thought goes behind each cocktail, the way they train mixologists, how the windows are frosted, and the cozy place. It's a role model cocktail bar for other places. I will be back with more friends as it's the perfect place to get cocktails! My only wish is to stay longer than two hours.~Berrie13~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here for the cocktail tasting menu. It was fabulous and plentiful. We rolled happily back to the hotel. The place is fun for people watching, though it's actually quite hard to find off the steet. It's well hidden. We didn't eat so can't comment on the food. ~Nicola66~Manchester
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had four drinks total and spent $85 including tip. The drinks are strong and the service was excellent. Great atmosphere with lounge style music. It is a little hidden but we had no problem finding it. ~Brooker430~Pooler, Georgia
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We travel a lot but this place takes some beating. Book in advance to avoid disappointment. Cocktails range from $13-22 with most costing around $16-18. Some really creative cocktails and they make them all right in front of you. If there is one place you should go while in DC this is it. ~Nicholeth~Oviedo, Florida
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were ushered into Barmini after dining at Minibar and had a great experience. "Dragons Breath" smokey drinks to bourbon filled peanuts~LCG1988~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Barmini~5058863~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What an incredible experience. Miguel provided a tour of the culinary senses by preparing incredible drinks and bringing awesome dishes. First, the dishes. Excellent and surprising oysters. A very tasty grilled cheese (valdeon) with truffle oil. Philly angle was good but the tuna tartare as the best I've ever had. Excellent suggestions for drinks included gin Mare and tears from a thousand swords. Thanks. ~Maiglesias~Saint Louis, Missouri
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Before you enter the restaurant,  the beautiful graffiti art decorating the exterior walls sets your mood. The interior is very simple,  but the menu offers some unique items. The waiter was friendly,  and service was prompt.  I highly recommend their chocolate dessert spiced with cinnamon, it was terrific. ~Tr1n1man~Orlando
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Even though we read the reviews, we still didn't know what we were getting into. We had never eaten at a Mexican restaurant quite like this one. We're from TN and we're a tad worried about the neighborhood while driving to the restaurant. There is very little parking so we parked on a side street and walked. It wasn't a problem at all. We arrived for lunch around 1 and were seated immediately (though the place was almost full).  It took several minutes for a waiter to arrive. We ordered a margarita each, mine frozen, his on the rocks. They come out with bread and an olive spread. I liked the bread but I don't like olives so I let my husband have that. I ordered the poblano, which came as a sandwich (wasn't expecting that) with salad. He ordered some kind of pork tacos with spicy fries. We each thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The total was right at $50.   I would go back, but I'd try other restaurants in the area first.~TNsnowflake~Knoxville
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellently presented contemporary Mexican establishment with a lively and exciting decor and patrons.  Service was excellent and warm and made you feel welcome in a space that could otherwise feel pretentious.  The food was adventurous with some interesting modern twists on traditional Mexican cuisine.  I am vegan and was excited to see that they catered to my kind with several options.  The appetizers were excellent but I found the main dish uninspired for somewhere that really wants to stand out and be funky.  Might be a result of my menu selection, otherwise a five star experience.~PaulBadgers1234~Estero, Florida
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was awesome the atmosphere unique... everything good...just a little the service...but I understand we all have a bad day!~kim s~Phoenix, Arizona
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friendly fun group of Mexican food lovers. I loved the Enchiladas Suizas they were fantastic! The Posole Verde was out of this world. If I could next time I will try the Quessadilla Cameron as it looked delicious. Our waiter Richard was fantastic! ~Colleen D~Windsor, California
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a very good Mexican Lunch with a friend. Very nice waiter. Food is authentic Mexican. White table cloth. Will go again.~StanUSA2014~Sellin, Germany
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had heard that this restaurant makes chiles en nogada.  Plus I visited the day before Mexican Independence day, when these are traditionally served.  For the price of about $24, I got a (one) chile en nogada--just one--made with chicken (chicken?) and covered with almond sauce.  Not badly prepared and fairly tasty, but it was not what I'd been craving.   It's a labor intensive dish to make, if you're doing it yourself.  However, if you're a restaurant serving it every day, you make bulk picadillo and sauce as needed.  The rest is putting it together and plating it.  This dish is traditional when fresh walnuts are in season.  Almonds don't cut it.  And none of this cuts it for the price, but I guess I had to do it once.~Cassandra M~Baltimore
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been here several times and have recommended it to several visitors to Phoenix. This is one of the best restaurants in town. When I say one of the best, I mean this is, in my book, #1 or #2. They take Mexican cuisine and show you a new twist. I have never had a bad meal here and I always leave well satisfied. You have to get the table side guacamole. The recipe for it is also online. Some tend to be surprised that this restaurant is not in a "classier" location but, I find that some of the best places are a little off the beaten path. I'm telling you, you have to stop here.~I_Relax~Phoenix
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was recommended by some friends. I was very disappointed. The portions were small. The food lacked flavor. It was very pricey for "edible" food. I didn't care for the decor either. All skulls. They served bread (instead of chips and salsa) with, what tasted like chopped pimentos and olives? It didn't taste like it was seasoned at all, just chopped up. The fries were pretty good, but I was surprised that they served fries with Mexican food. The ketchup was good... and I don't really care for ketchup.~Patti P~El Mirage, Arizona
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Second time at the Barrio Cafe, and the food was just phenominal as before. My wife had the Chiles en Nogales which is jusy a culinary masterpiece, both myself and had the Penasco Del Mar, and it was just incredible! We took advantage of their happy hour and we had the Barrio Bomba, it was really refreshing and went well with our meal. The service, as in the past, as was the other day disappointing. The staff really doesnt seem like they care you are there, which is a shame. My mother-in-law ordered the "Tres Leche", first they told us they didnt have any, later fund out it was because the chef that day didn't know how to prepare it, then we were told they could do it. Here is the bad part, they brought out a dry crumbled up pound cake (Hostess brand possibly), they topped it with whip cream, they tried to pass it off as the real thing, didn't come close we noticed it right off. If an establishment doesn't have what you ordered, leave it at that, don't fudge it over on customers, it nearly ruined our dining experience, and coming from 20 miles away north just to dine there, we are sceptical about a return visit. However, with all that said, because of the extraordinary culinary masterpieces hopefully we will be back, but would skip on the tres leche. ;o)  ~Mike M~Glendale, Arizona
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best Mexican I have had - and that is saying something. Incredibly diverse menu from all parts South of the Border. Staff knows the dishes and where they come from. I was raised in the Southwest and this place blew my mind. Make sure and park out back and check out the murals by local Angel Diaz.~TBoneStockholm~Stockholm
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The outside of Barrio is covered in graffiti art, and once inside, it's basic and welcoming.  The menu is truly remarkable and unexpected... not that I thought it wouldn't be good, but I didn't think it would be some of the best and most unique Mexican food I've had.  The Pato en Tamarindo bringing a seared duck dish together with a tamarind chipotle reduction, and the Chili Colorado with chiles ancho and a red wine reduction are just a couple.  Other sauces that sounded interesting, but haven't tried yet are the hibiscus flower port reduction and crispy shallots; dried apricot and pecans and almond cream sauce; lump crab, scallops in tomatillo cream reduction.    It's no surprise that the chef was a semi-finalist for the James Beard Award.  Give it shot if you're in town.  You won't be disappointed.~Mike S~Arlington, Virginia
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants ever. The menu is varied, although everything is fantastic. It's not your typical Mexican fare either. It's upscale cuisine in a colorful local area (Pun intended because all of the local art beautiful and adds to the experience). Get there early or be prepared to wait a bit because they do not accept reservations. However, I would wait hours for this food. Wonderful.~vietti~Overland Park, Kansas
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited for lunch on a Saturday and were not disappointed,  We arrived around 1PM and were promptly and courteously seated.  Live music playing added to the festive feel.  I wish I could remember our servers names because he was amazing.  All of his recommendations were spot on.  The Skinny Margarita was the best and we enjoyed it more than their regular version.  The sangria was unique and refreshing.  Restaurant was very clean and the interior and exterior are covered in murals which are very taste and culture specific, so this could be off putting for some who are less than open minded and adventurous.  We tried the guacamole, Cochinita Pibil and Pollo Poblano, all superb. Definitely will be returning to try some of the other fantastic sounding dishes.~Janike1~Scottsdale, Arizona
Barrio Cafe~338181~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Barrio with friends on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  We found the restaurant easily and the artistry on the outside of the building is amazing!  The food was very delicious with 3 of the 4 of us having something different.  Two of our group had Chiles en Nogada, one had Pescado (Fish Tacos) and one had Suizas (Enchiladas).  Each of us enjoyed our meals.  We started the meal with fresh guacamole, which was also very tasty.~Grant F~Calgary, Canada
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A small and very busy counter in the Reading Terminal Market that has so many unique flavors of rich, decadent ice cream. ~Craig M~Reading, Pennsylvania, United States
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~According to the Reading Market food tour, this is the oldest ice cream vendor in USA and is still run by something like the sixth generation of the original family.  That alone made it worth trying for me.  Their ice cream tends towards sweet, meaning that the sweet taste somewhat overpowers the other flavors such as fruit flavor, and creamy/ soft, meaning that it does not have a firm texture and melts quickly. I know these are signs of a good quality ice cream with a high fat content, but I tend to prefer a firmer and less sweet ice cream.  They also did not have any really off-the-wall artisanal flavors - pomegranate, which I ordered, was about as unusual as they got and it tasted pretty close to black cherry.  They will give you a cup with your cone if you order a cone, and I recommend you do get the cup because my cone was leaning like the Tower of Pisa and eventually started to leak out the bottom before I'd finished it.  Staff are very nice and good at handling the many tourists who don't know what they want off the many-flavored menu.  Worth a stop.~Bunnydots~Baltimore, MD
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Basset's has been a part of Philly for as long as the Liberty Bell (well, not quite). And especially the Reading Terminal location makes for a great treat and not just in the Summer. A variety of flavors (including sherbets) provide something for the kid in all of us. And the quality is why they have been around for so long. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor.~DinEd~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hard to miss, at front of Terminal Really nice service Awesome ice cream;  had the coffee and peanut butter swirl on a heath cone~txbride~Houston
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had a vanilla milkshake, which was made with 3-4 large scoops of ice cream and milk, blended but so thick the shake barely made it out of the blender's metal cup into my cup, and I enjoyed the shake while I walked through Independence Mall for the rest of the morning~springbreakdad54~new jersey
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you need to cool off this one the best places to go if your in center city, stop in and have some ice cream and finish the rest of your day.~464keithr~Philadelphia
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In our afternoon tour of the Reading Terminal Market, we eyed up all kinds of yummy snacks, desserts and tons of options for lunch...but we held out for some ice cream on a hot day in September.  Bassetts met the bill and then some. I requested a cookies and cream cone and it was over the top delicious, more than big enough scoop and I was the envy of every passers-by on our easy walk back to the convention center. ~melissam7268~Malvern, Pennsylvania
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In the historic Reading Terminal Market this is a Philadelphia trdition.  They scoop the ice cream and serve it just as they've been doing for over 100 years~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Inside Reading Terminal Market you can experience the best ice cream in Philadelphia still made the same way for over 100 years~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located just inside the reading terminal, this made the perfect desert to our foodie experience. Loved it!~Lisa B~Dover, Delaware
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Shared a scoop of butter pecan with my wife. Very good, but bit expensive at $4.25. Not busy in the morning, easy in and out, location good in terminal near one of the doors.~Kevin E~Newark
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by on the way out of the market.  What great service and the ice cream was so rich.  They has a bunch of options, and even with the crowd service was fast.~Ken P~Ligonier, Pennsylvania
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The ice cream is incredible!  The service is fantastic and friendly. The Salted Caramel  is my personal favorite. ~PamPrefers~Virginia
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The line is an indication of how delicious the ice cream is and how popular a spot in Reading Terminal.  Fun watching families enjoy their choice of flavors.~55plustraveler2010~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have a really nice range of flavors and the ice cream has a really good texture. We loved it. Very friendly staff. ~Weaselmcpuppy~dekalb
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This ice cream was worth the wait, great quality and quantity. I had the Irish cream and the pomegranate sorbet. I was in heaven, lol. ~sammied3000~New York
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever we visit Philadelphia we try (and generally succeed) to visit this landmark Reading Terminal ice cream stand. There may be more premium ice creams, but few places offer the friendly authentic ambience of the Basset's ice cream stand, and its welcoming staff. ~Joseph G~Jerusalem, Israel
Bassetts Ice Cream~2321510~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~and huge scoops , nice variety to choose from, friendly servers , nice treat with the free ice water ( sometimes you just need some water to "rince & flush" your mouth with )especially when eating a proper decent ice cream truelly worthy of it's name , CREAMY, full of flavor no artifical addings (f.ex.  pistachio ice cream isn't  fully bright green but slightly colored as one expects  when asking for real pistacchio~whirefox~Hooglede, Belgium
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A very cool place on the water with views of NYC.  Fine dining with a great vibe. The fun design alone is fun but the food is excellent. I believe it leans to seafood but there are other choices. If your looking for something different, this is it!~Chi-Town910~Jersey City, New Jersey
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Batello was amazing for my niece's wedding. Her ceremony took place there also and it was beautifully done. Food was fantastic, excellent service and bartenders. The view is incredible. Highly recommend for a wedding or dinner.~Maureen O~Colonia, New Jersey
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Battello should really only be listed as a private event space. Arrived today for a brunch as advertised only to find the place closed. This is the third time this has happened. 3 strikes and you're out.  Never ever going back!!!~NJYBeachy~New York City, New York
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Each of us had four different entrees and shared two appetizers. The first bite is always telling as to the rest of the meal. Our first bites in each dish was delicious and very good food flavors. Our meal was enhanced with the gorgeous river view of New York City!   A few notes should you be considering dining here - . if you're planning to have good conversation and be able to hear each other, dine in the interior part of the restaurant. The glass enclosed "outer" area which has the city views, has a high noise level when the restaurant is full and those tables are close in proximity to each other. . the menu is limited but offers good options and items are creative in ingredients and flavors . the menu items are expensive and in my opinion, at least $5 more than the items should be for a restaurant in Jersey City. The portions are not large but adequate.  . this is not a fine dining restaurant with table cloths, etc. - which if it is, would also support the menu pricing. It's more dressy rustic informal.  . Staff service adequate not exceptional - which if it is, would also support the menu pricing.  Battello offers very good food and city views - both for an expensive but enjoyable meal.~Visitors4~United States
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I will admit, the location of this restaurant is worth every cent. On the waterfront of jersey facing Manhattan with a view of the marina, it's a stunning setting.   The food, which was reasonably priced for quality, took at least 40 minutes to arrive, which was strange for a restaurant that seems to run a tight ship. Our waiter was friendly and the staff appeared to be very with it, but our wait for the food was somewhat strange. Luckily, we were celebrating a birthday and ate up the time with unwrapping presents.  All in all, this place is a very nice location for dates, family gatherings, and any type of celebration including weddings.   4/5 stars. Will return. ~aee99~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for a great spot with free parking, or within walking distance from the Newport PATH station, look no further.  Battello offers a variety of craft beers and a menu that changes with the seasons.  It's a great spot for lunch, drinks after work or a great meal.~Chris F~New York City, New York
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was okay. To start we made reservations thru open table, parking was easy to acquire on a Wednesday night. Normally valet is $10. To start we got the Burrata heirloom appetizer which was really tasty ($14). For the entree I ordered the dinner portion of the egg fettuccine ($25) which just didn't have enough flavor. It was quite bland and definitely was missing something. It was not worth the $25.  My husband got the chicken entree ($27) which was pretty standard, again nothing amazing. Service was polite but forgetful and at times slow. They carry a house wine, which the waiter offered a sample of but never brought to our table. We ended up getting a $39 bottle of wine which was excellent. The 2 cocktails we got were decent but not worth the $12 as they tasted very watered down. $12 is a craft cocktail and these just did not taste that great. We asked for the dessert menu but then decided to opt out of it because for the prices we just didn't feel that the food was that great. $11 for dessert didn't seem worth the price or calories. The waiter made no conversation and was very robotic and dull. It was actually our anniversary and if he had bothered to ask or just talk to us we would have shared the info. He could have cared less and just wanted us to order, get our food and get out. The view is nice but you can see the same view anywhere on Washington Ave/along the pier. Doubt we will return.~Serena N~Jersey City, New Jersey
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the ambiance! What a cool, airy space. Amazing views. The kale and fig salad was incredible. The chicken and polenta was amazing. The black bass was just so-so but the sweet potato and zucchini rings side accompaniments were excellent.~yvonne4747~New York City, New York
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service is good,   Food is good but not great .   But its a fun place to go. Always busy.  Great place to bring friends and family the first time they are in town.~Laurie W~Jersey City, New Jersey
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant is located in a pier at the Houston river side in Jersey City, NJ, to be assisted  by your GPS is a good recomendation if it is your first visit, because it is hidden in that part of the street and located in a pier. It has an interesting deco and a magnificent view to the Marina.  The menu offer a lots of very interesting options and different to the traditional dishes that you find in a resturant. It is restaurant that I will come back because I would like to try also other options in the menu. For dessert the Coconut Rice Pudding, with roasted coconut, it is delicious.~Jerraz~Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is right on the waterfront in Jersey City.  Recently redesigned by the Kitchen Cousins from HGTV.   Nice menu and  bar.  Across from the Westin.  Make sure you check with them for availability since they do a lot of events and often are closed on weekends due to this.~John L~Orlando, Florida
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is s great place location wise if you love the sea which I am fond of.  However if your wife is not into it what can you say.  This establishment has a nice open bar and I mean open atmosphere thus it might feel cold.  Food is good but tends to get cold fast.  Best for the bar environment. Newport Marina is well attended by office peeps nearby.~Miramax2013~Jersey City, New Jersey
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Upscale restaurant on the Hudson River in Jersey City. Located in the marina area with fantastic views of the NYC skyline. The interior is a trendy industrial design with wonderful ambient lighting. The service was very good, the wine list was reasonably priced with a scattering of California selections. The food was good-but not great. I would go back for the view, ambience, and service hoping that the food quality and presentation improved.~Kevin34862~Morgan Hill, California
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visiting Batello's on a beautiful day this week was a lovely break from Manhattan. The food was terrific (the place is also exceedingly clean), service is efficient and friendly and the views are lovely as the wall of glass doors open onto the Hudson River.It is a 20 minute trip from 34th street PATH, First stop on Journal Square route is the Newport stop. Enjoyed looking at beautiful boats docked along the walk to the restaurant. Restaurant decor is comfortable and smart. Take a trip over for a change of pace and an enjoyable meal.~gmad1110~New York City, New York
Battello~6453534~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had an extremely enjoyable dinner, sitting outside in October.  It was the perfect evening and the food was great.  It took a bit to determine what I wanted but after all was said and done, I made the right choice and it was outside the box for me.~KurtLS~Lee's Summit, Missouri
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Busy and chilled atmosphere at the same time.  Really crowded, yet booth we had downstairs had sublime music at a volume that allowed us to still talk.  Service was top notch, drinks and food were 5 star quality.  Really great steak and sides. Dessert (pictured) a treat - shared by table.  Would go back for business or personal in a heart beat.~Seven22~High Wycombe, United Kingdom
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Came here during a visit to Chicago and it was well worth it.  Made reservations 2 months before to ensure we would get in.  Some say it is very expensive but is on par with a normal steakhouse.  $38 for a petite filet, $55 for a rib eye, is ala carte.  Service was top notch every step of the way.  I had a petite filet and it was a good size at 6 oz. Was excellent and cooked to perfection. For sides we had brussel sprouts and the mac and cheese and it was dreamy to say the least. We did not have room for desert.  Dress is not fancy, you could be comfortable in nice jeans or a suit.  This was a well worth it meal.  I would come here again hands down.  And, if you don't feel like a steak, the burgers are equally as good. Won't disappoint.~jmoonesq~Naples, Florida
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Excellent Steak, potato, and service( I ate at the bar).  Friendly and professional bartender and awesome Manhattan and Old Fashion.  Not cheap, but worth the splurge.~radams006~Kalispell, MT
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Fantastic ambience and nice decor, seated in a booth. Nice welcome and server outlined all the options. Some minor quibbles, promised the house special sourdough bread, but had to ask for it. Main came, but wine was forgotten, and then somewhat on the chilly side for a Malbec! Made for a slower consumption so maybe a good thing.  Salad was delicious- apple and candied pecans - and the mains were exquisite, filet and lamb chops. Baked sweet potato really good. Overall would recommend but need to tighten up on some of the service elements.~Peter O~Dublin
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Four of us celebrated my 50th birthday and the experience was incredible.  First off, let me say that we were there for 4 hours!  But it felt like a fraction of that.  The chairs we sat in were so comfortable we could have stayed another 4 easily.  Try to get a table in the lower level if possible.  Much quieter and more relaxed down there.  The food was great.  Our server John was the best.  The byo wine policy is fun and free.  I can't wait to go back.~Rob C~Crystal Lake, Illinois
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~I am a steak lover - always have been and always will be. Even so, I tend to shy away from expensive steak restaurants because I'm often disappointed. My husband made our reservations for this restaurant about 6 weeks ahead of time after looking for just the right place and I was thrilled with my meal!   We arrived at the restaurant a little early so we sat at the bar and enjoyed a craft cocktail while we waited for our table. I would go back just to sit at the bar again (but I would also want another steak! For dinner, I had the Dry Aged Bone in Rib Eye and it was worth every penny! I couldn't finish my steak at dinner so the next day I had an amazing breakfast before we headed out to the airport. In addition to our steaks we also had Wedge Salads, Roasted Tomatos and the Truffle Mac & Cheese. It was all excellent!  The service was exactly what you would expect from this type of restaurant. Our server was friendly but formal and he took time with each part of our meal to make sure that everything was perfect.  If you go and order a meal like ours with cocktails and wine be prepared that it is rather expensive however for a special occasion it is well worth it. You may also want to bring a tiny flashlight so you can see the menu since the restaurant is very dimmly lit! We loved this place and hope to return if our travels ever take us back to Chicago.~smdaigle~Cleveland, TN
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~If its your first time in Chicago you have to come here. The food is incredible, the steak is one of the best i've ever had. The ambiance is all about the prohibition era. Everything is amazing. ~MacariaQ~Mexico City, Mexico
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Let me start off by saying their steak is good, but not worth the $70 it charges.  If you know a good butcher you can certainly buy a steak just as good and grill it yourself.  That's what I was thinking the entire time I was eating the steak.  The "$70 steak" certainly did not blow my away.  Wine list is on the weak side.  Having said that, the ambience and the service is excellent.  The bread and butter was outstanding; it impressed me more than the steak.  A good choice to celebrate a special occasion.  Though it is not quiet at all because of all the chatter that goes on.~LAX-HKG~Los Angeles
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~The food at Bavettes was sublime.   I am not surprised it is No. 2 in Chicago.   We visited it on a Tuesday evening at 6.00 pm and it was buzzing.   Staff were very good, friendly and helpful with menu choices.   I had the Filet Mignon (6 oz) and it literally melted in the mouth - beautifully cooked as was everything else we ate.   Could not fault.~icequeen5210~Exeter, United Kingdom
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~The wait staff was impeccable. My water was never empty (you would be amazed at how often my water runs dry even and high end restaurants). And since I don't drink anything but water, this is much appreciated. My husband and I loved the setting, although use of our reading glasses were a must due to the dim lighting.  Best wedge salad I've had.~Hope556~Madison, Wisconsin
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~This is a high-end restaurant, from start to finish.  The decor fits with the old streak house theme, and the service, from the front desk to the entire staff is outstanding.  That was surprising to me as the staff is on the younger side, but they were the equal if not better than any other restaurant I've been at over the last ten or twenty years.  I never had to ask for anything, to include my water glass being filled continually.  Mostly, I loved their attitude.  The food was very high quality.  I particularly liked the shrimp de jonghe.  Some of the other dishes didn;t quite hit the mark for me, but that was only a mater of taste, not quality.  The crab cakes were stuffed full of luscious blue crab, but they were baked.  They were good, but as a personal preference, I think I like fried better.  The stroganoff had perhaps the best short ribs I've eatened, but the sauce was a little heavy for me and without the tang of sour cream.  It was good, but I think I prefer a more classic recipe.  The salmon and bone marrow were excellent, but the lemon meringue pie had one inch of lemon and five inches of meringue.  We left most of the meringue on the plate.  The criticisms above are not really criticisms.  Everything was prepared well and with the highest-quality ingredients.  I am just expressing some personal preferences.  I still loved everything.  Next time, I'm getting a steak.  The ones we saw looked fantastic.  This is a top-level restaurant, and unlike some that are more flash than substance, this one is both.  I highly recommend it.~Jonathan B~Bangkok
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~This is an unassuming restaurant from the outside but from the moment you walk in it is stunning.  Benjamin who served our table was remarkable and an asset to the restaurant.  Impeccable service!! The meal was stunning.  Incredible steak that is most probably the best steak I have had.  We booked this restaurant 6 weeks ago and was sooo worth it!  Would go back in a heartbeat!~MicheleCole~Napier, New Zealand
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~This is my second visit to Chicago in 6 months, I wasn't able to get a reservation to any steak house the first time and didn't want to miss out this go around, Did some research and choose Bavette and I'm  SOOO happy , I did.  If, I could give this restaurant 10 stars, I would. The ambiance, food and above all the service was amazing. The staff is so accommodating and knowledgeable. The menu selection has something for everyone's taste even if you are not a steak eater but Chicago is known for its beef so go for it.  I had the Bone in filet Mignon with the Peppercorn crust. Cooked perfectly ( I am picky) The mash potatoes added a great addition to my meal. Lets not forget dessert.- Carrot Cake a must try.  The ambiance gives old world feel, speak easy vibe. Low lighting. There is a upstairs and a downstairs lounge that is a little more relaxed. Both are great. I was upstairs.  Last but not least the service. It was so good, I called over the manager to express the excellent service the waiter gave. I so rarely do that but he deserved it all. Helpful in all ways about the menu.  There are a few steakhouses in Chicago. This one is a must to try.~Ariana J~New York City, New York
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~Went there on a Friday night. Sat upstairs across from the bar. Steaks are good. Ambiance is old school steak house.  If you don't get the Mac n cheese with Bacon as a side you wasted your choice on side!   The reason I am writing is because 1/2 way through dinner my wife started feeling sick. So we needed to leave. No this was not food related. Anyway, Brandon, our server went above and beyond the call of his duty!  He got the rest of our meal packed up, took care of the bill quickly, hailed us a cab, when the food was wrapped up he ran it out to us on the street while we were getting in the cab....and he gave us a complimentary piece chocolate cream pie!   Not to mention before all that went down, he had great table presence, great conversation, was very humorous and very attentive.  He is awesome!    We will definitely be back to Bavette's and we will request to sit in Brandon's section.   If you are reading this, Thank You very much for going above and beyond!~Jim T~Chicago, Illinois
Bavette's Bar and Boeuf~3606915~Chicago~Illinois~Traveler's Choice~dark, speak-easy like atmosphere but comfortably romantic and quiet, bavette's  food is well prepared and served. this place was highly recommended and it's easy to understand why: the drink, an old fashioned, and certainly one of the best i've ever tasted, as well as my excellent pork chop with mashed potatoes with a starter, the crab cake, were delicious, no complaints here. ask for a downstairs table to be certain of intimacy. it's a fun retreat so go for it.~parkpie~Bloomington, Indiana
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As the title says, the mac n cheese is really creamy and good. I'm glad I stopped by to try some while I was out there.~mercur05~Chicago, Illinois
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beecher is right across from the main market in Pike Place.  Fun to stand outside and watch them adding ingredients and stirring.  Head in and grab a sample and some to take home; quite a few varieties; I prefer No Woman but they are all good!~greatcats~Seattle, Washington
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beecher's is some of the best cheese I have ever had.  It is interesting to watch from the windows the cheese being made.  We went back several hours later to see a different stage of the cheese process.  They have samples which is great to try and narrow down the choices.  The cheese curds are fantastic and so squeaky when chewed!  Our favorite is the Flagship cheese.  A person can buy Beecher's mac and cheese as well.  If you like cheese at all, you need to come here!~minnesotans4~Saint Paul, Minnesota
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been to the market a million times, but we have never braved the line for Beechers. It was well worth the wait. We both had a sandwich, which was great... but the Mac and Cheese was exceptional.~kellirp~Cloverdale BC
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious cheeses and also some lunch items if you're hungry. Bought their signature cheese but didn't bring any home. ~Theresa O~Farmingville, New York
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Must visit for cheese lover...try the dungeness crab grilled cheese sandwich it is da bomb..also great cheese~zebcarvalho~Melbourne, Australia
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped here for a quick gander at the cheese making process.  Fascinating!   Have samples to try - was tempted to buy the cheese was so tasty but we were traveling that same day and was not feasible.   If you like cheese it's worth the stop.   ~Joy G~Durham, North Carolina
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The reviews raved about the cheese here, but I didn't find it to be anything extraordinary. The Mac N Cheese was pretty good, but not any better than other freshly made mac and cheese I have had at other restaurants. The grilled cheese sandwich was the same. Good but nothing to write home about. (And I LOVE cheese). It is very cool to get to watch them making the cheese though. That is definitely unique about this place. We went on a Saturday and it was very crowded. We only waited about 10 minutes, but there were no places to sit. There are only about 10 barstools in there for people to sit at, and no tables. This is more of a grab and go type of place.~karag773~Chattanooga, Tennessee
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is another Pike Market must-see. Fun to watch them make the cheese, The Flagship handmade cheese is sooo delicious. We tried the mac and cheese made from this and it was to die for. We took several chunks of Flagship home with us.~SDnative5~San Diego, California
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was fun to stop in.  Its right outside of Pikes Market and its ALWAYS busy! The basic cheese are really good! Some of the more specializes flavored cheeses were ok.  And I have to say it the Mac and cheese people rave about really is just average mac and cheese.  I would waste the calories on getting it again. It wasnt bad just not that special.  They do make cheese in the window which is cool to watch!  Stop in get a few free samples maybe by some to take to take home.~SteelCity13~Austin, Texas
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in on a rainy saturday. The line was wrapped around the building but it was worth the wait. The mac n cheese and the flagship sandwich were delightful ~rrenfro1~Tulsa, Oklahoma
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went there for their famous grilled cheese sandwich. Price was just under $6.00 and the Tomato Soup around $4.60 for a small cup.   The sandwich was made on sourdough bread, lots of melted cheese on it, and while it was tasty, I did not think it was really anything special or in fact that one could not duplicate at it home. The cheese itself was nice, but I have certainly had much better tasting cheese, especially since I am one that really likes  white old aged cheddar.  The soup was touted as their "flagship" soup. Again, I found nothing really special about the soup, especially for the price. I like my soup hot, this was just better than warm.   The attraction here is that you can watch the beginnings of making cheese. Interesting and very touristy.   I doubt i would go back, tried it once and that was enough.~yvr1~Vancouver, Canada
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Working with cheese I was excited to visit and try their cheese. I as going to order the grilled cheese but after sampling some cheese I decided against it. Cheese was okay  but nothing fabulous. I have tried cheese that is much better so skipped the grilled cheese.~BelaN74~Mississauga, Canada
Beecher's Handmade Cheese~876069~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You could not really call the crab sandwich a crab sandwich as the amount of crab was so skimpy you could barely locate it or taste it. My husband got a turkey sandwich and it was the same hardly any turkey plus neither one came with any condiments. The atmosphere is like a small diner with not much seating and you have to wait to get one. The food was not cheap for how little you were served either. I would say go only to watch the cheese being made and some small samples of cheese but otherwise don't bother eating there as there are many other places to eat in Pike Place Market with better food.~TravelGoddess61~Chico, California
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Absolutely great donuts. Watch them get made fresh in front of you and pick them up still warm.......and oh so tasty. If your in reading terminal in Philly it's a must stop and have~ken c~Brick, New Jersey
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Donuts are freshly made and only .99cents each. The variety is endless. Of course a warm donut is the best! At times the line was unbelievable.  Salty Caramel had a nice topping but I wasn't crazy for the filling. The glazed donut was cooked perfectly, a warm cinnamon and cream cheese roll was best warm.~WorrywartBoston~Boston
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everyone has their favorite Beilers donut..My personal favorite if the chocolate frosted with fruity pebbles on top...Go find your favorite.    It will be hard to decide but it will be fun trying to figure it out...Delicious!~Jetset34~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I am have a monster sweet tooth, but this place is awesome. After having their donuts, Dunkin and Krispy  are a faint memory. These are fresh and lots of variety. Always a line so get there early!~Layla117~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I didn't like the donuts, I LOVED THEM! Although there was a HUGE line that took 30 min... :/ The donuts are a bit too sugary. That's all I have to say! Finito.~Unisilk~Hoboken, New Jersey
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I saw so many people walking around Philly with this box and thought this is interesting - I must check it out...Went to the Reading Terminal market and saw what the fuss was all about...a LINE of people waiting !  For a taste of Heaven!!!! So good - a must taste in Philly!~Mew6160~New York
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seems everyone loves Beiler's Doughnuts.  Our experience was not very good as our blueberry fritters were raw inside and the banana cream doughnuts were missing the bananas.  Our opinion is that there are better doughnuts out there than Beiler's. ~Sailorsgirl~Springfield, Missouri
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So I have been hearing about Beiler's for a few years now so I decided to stop by and have one...OMG!!!!!  The donuts are loaded and they are all so good AND fresh.  Try one and you will never even consider a horrible Dunkin Donuts donut again.  ~rusty1970~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~These donuts are light and fluffy, sweet and addictive!!! First time trying these after my girlfriend kept bragging about it, LOL... Soo glad I did....  A must try..!!!~Tye G~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This bakery is a gem! Right across from carmens famous cheesesteaks & beliers for dessert- we had their special x2 doughnuts & a coffee for $2.99!  Amazing deal and delicious! ~carmentom2014~London, United Kingdom
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wanted a snack so waited on the line in the late afternoon but worth the wait!  Many of the donut options were sold out by the time I reached the front of the line so had to get something!  I selected the blueberry cake donut which was glazed and crisp and the cinnamon donut which was surprisingly yummy. It was not crisp but chewy and had a perfect amount of cinnamon.   This is a must when you go to the Reading Terminal Market!~chaufun~New York City
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Watch the donuts being made from the line you'll be in while waiting to order. The first time I waited in line it took 15 minutes to get to the order spot. By that time they had sold out of the flavor I wanted. New batches are made throughout the day but I just returned the next day and was able to get the flavors I wanted.  It's difficult to see the donut selection before getting in line because the customer line wraps in front of the case.  Seasonal flavors are offered. Cream filled and cake donuts on menu. Many flavors available. Good prices. ~mhdaisy~Carmel, Indiana
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stop here every time we are in Philadelphia! The donuts are amazing!!!! The line was super long on Saturday so we came back Monday and it was much better. Love these donuts! ~Shannon K~Utica, New York, USA
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked past their display case while wandering around the market. We couldn't resist getting 6 donuts. Amazing. We tried some of the "different" flavors like Maple and Caramel Apple. They all were delicious.  There will be a line, but it moves fast. We were there on a Wednesday afternoon and waiting in line for less than 10 minutes. So worth it. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Philly.~Diane L~Monroe Township
Beiler's Bakery~3964520~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~best donuts i've had in a long time.long wait on weekends .go weekday early.fritters good to.can get a box to take with you~jacka82942~florida
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A legend even among the world's top bars Bemelmans is enlivened by good jazz, strong drinks, and a sophisticated crowd.  The beautiful drawings on the walls and the seriously professional service makes the locale deeply memorable.~murrayhiller~murrayhill
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best atmosphere in town, always singer surprises and drink collection of old ages. Murals on the walls another top tip~meganmary2016~New York City, New York
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Even for a teetotaller this is a must. We had delicious 'mocktails' to be able to take in the atmosphere and ambience together with good live music. ~wwandrag~Johannesburg, South Africa
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great drinks, Great service, hip crowd. A New  York must see! Great music. The drinks are delicious by the way~Thomas C~Millville, New Jersey
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had very high hopes and expectations of this bar. We walked a LONG way through the city in the snow to experience a late night cocktail and were greeted with a live Jazz band, dimly lit bar, amazing paintings on the wall..everything I was hoping for. We got a seat at the bar and after a very long wait, we got a menu. We ordered and to be honest and much to my disappointment the drinks were nothing to write home about. I like a well made cocktail, and sadly this wasn't for me. Maybe an off day but it took the shine off of what should have been a very memorable drink. ~busastep~Edinburgh, UK
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this bar, it is expensive and charges a cover but it is worth it.  there are surprises of singers that just arrive and start singing.  ~Maria C~Bogota
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this place! Bemelmans murals on the walls to the live music. This place perfect to visit after dinner.  ~DeniseCims~Manhattan Beach, California
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seriously, this place is worth the price. My fiance and I came here for my birthday, and we ended up spending the entire evening here. I enjoyed every second of the live jazz music, singing along in an intimate, quaint space. The service was incredible. The drinks were pricey but you paid for the show and venue.   I am coming back every time I come to NYC. I felt so relaxed and met some really nice people!~Beccarter10~Greenville, South Carolina
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The $25pp (table service, $18pp at the bar) cover charge may be off putting but it is worth visiting this bar at some stage while you are in New York. The ambience is fantastic and they have a great wine menu... however, the star of the show will always be the art on the walls.~antkav087~Dublin, Ireland
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The coctails ain't cheap but the venue is a classic.  Sit at the bar and listen to the music... always good, always that lounge from days gone by - feel and the bar snacks keep you ordering more...  The mural  was done by the artist from the children's book  Madeline-Fame... Across the lobby can have excellent acts ... it's cheaper if you get an early seat at the bar..  ~Seabassnow~New York City, New York
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant has an unique decor and ambiance. Me and my husband enjoyed the pleasant live piano music, adding to the great atmosphere. The problem was the food and the service. Food was mediocre at best and the service was slow and quite annoying. Drinks are slightly pricy.~M_Norstein~San Diego, California
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of the most sophisticated, classy hotel bars in New York City. With the world's only original sketches from the "Madeline" book series (book written & illustrated by Bemelman) adorning the walls and lampshades it is also very warm, snug and cozy. A piano plays classic American tunes providing just the right volume of background music. It conjures up images of pianists Bobby Short, Cole Porter...Casablanca's Rick's Americain Cafe, the 1950's, stockings, martinis, etc.  a landmark bar in a landmark hotel.   There's a great original cocktail menu, albeit expensive, definitely worth trying. Wine list is good and included several of our favorite proseccos and pinots. Complete single malt scotch list -- again quite expensive. There's also some bar food available in case you're hungry. But most people just go for the drinks and ambiance.   Service is unflapple old world styled. Men in white jackets deftly holding trays of beautiful drinks, pouring water, replenishing the snack bowl...all polite and experienced. Note there is a cover charge added to your bill after 9:30pm, when the featured artist begins.   Put Bemelmans on your bucket list and go relax, enjoy, and feel sophisticated!~Joseph P~Vero Beach, Florida
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tucked in a corner of the Carlyle Hotel is Bemelman's Bar. The bar is small and fills up quickly. Pay special attention to the walls, you may recognize some of the drawings from 'Madeleine'!   Service is great! I got the very last seat on the very edge of the bar. When a seat in the middle opened up, the bartender saved it for me and then invited me to sit in it, which was very thoughtful. Try the Passion Royale! Perfect summer drink - tastes just like a cherry limeade!~Cara C~Boston, Massachusetts
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for the experience and drinks.  The room is great and the drinks were good.  The seating is tight with many people squeezed in on a Sunday afternoon.  the music was pleasant. Expensive but probably worth it~john3429~Sunbury, Australia
Bemelmans Bar~1143073~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When it's quiet, it's a romantic and cozy place for a drink; when its noisy, you feel lucky you have managed to get a table.  The only down side is getting a table--and when there's music, which is often first-rate, it's obviously hard to have a conversation.  Drinks are expensive, but generous.  ~murrayhiller~murrayhill
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As native Californians, my husband and I were eager to try the infamous "NYC bagel" and were excited to experience all it's glory! This place was recommended to us by our hotel and further research on Yelp had very positive reviews so we dropped by. The line was LONG and continued outside the cafe. It took us about 20 minutes just to place our order. I ordered a typical everything bagel with cream cheese (toasted) and my husband ordered something a little more complex, though I am not sure what it was (had scrambled eggs on it). When we finally got our bagel, we were both left pretty underwhelmed. We noticed NO DIFFERENCE between the NY bagels and the ones we have back home in Cali. However, the dressings on my husband's bagel made it all the better. They were very generous with their portions and the flavors tasted delicious together. My bagel ceased to amaze me and wasn't anything extraordinary (it hit the spot though). Overall, the bagels are good, but I wouldn't stand in line for 20 minutes just to get one. Service is pretty poor, but I think that's just a NY thing...~HoneyLea~Santa Barbara, California
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Awesome bagels, great variety, all fresh, choice of spreads, egg, lox.  Very good coffee. Busy, great for take out.~Jim M~San Francisco, California
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best Bagel and Coffee has the best bagels!  I recommend an Everything Bagel with Scallion Cream Cheese....so yum!  The coffee is not the best however, though you can't be the best at everything. :)~nosila2~Toronto, Canada
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't mind the long queues, those bagels definitely worth it. Many types to choose from, very good cooking, excellent outcome. ~Konstantinos K~Athens, Greece
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Extremely busy but line moves fast. Standard service but delicious food. Bacon egg and cheese bagel was everything I dreamed of and more. Reasonable prices for NYC! ~collette1109~Shelby, North Carolina
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great choice, reasonably priced, very efficient, used by locals which speaks volumes.....fab for breakfast.  The only negative was the lack of space to sit and eat~Lynne&Col-UK~UK
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I work a couple of blocks away, and have walked past this, but assumed it was another over-hyped bagel place. Since moving here, I've been underwhelmed by the bagels I've had, I haven't found most to be much better than what I could get at a Panera, or somewhere similar, so I was skeptical. One day, I had a craving, and decided to grave the line, to see if it lived up to its name.  Have to admit, it was pretty darn good, and the best bagel I've had since I've been in NYC. Chewy and just the right combination of textures. Tasted very fresh, too, no need to toast.~jannes715~New York City, New York
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really popular place, queue was in the street when we arrived about 10am. Service was efficient and very well organised. Loads of choice for bagels and fillings. We opted for onion bagel with a smoked salmon & cream cheese filling and a New York filling. These were enormous !! Bagels were fresh and extremely tasty. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a filling breakfast at a reasonable price.~pegasuss64~Liverpool, United Kingdom
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walked here from our hotel due to the fabulous reviews.  There wasn't a lot of seating but we found a small table.  What can I say, the bagels were amazing.~Sara O~West Seneca, New York, United States
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited during a busy lunchtime. It really was the best bagel I've ever had!! Went for an onion bagel with pastrami. salad and cheese plus coffee for $13. Kept me going for the rest of the day!~munchies862~Milton Keynes, United Kingdom
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We waited 20 minutes based on other reviews then understood why everyone was lined up behind us.  We split one breakfast sandwich just to save the other for a snack later!~Hollis444~Springfield, Missouri
Best Bagel and Coffee~2563134~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Best Bagel and Coffee based on all the rave reviews.  We did not find the bagels any different from anywhere else and the coffee was what we buy at Sheetz gas stations.  No self service sugar or milk available, they will add them upon request.   I don't get all the hype. The restaurant offers no bathrooms for the customers.~GraceinVirginia~Virginia, USA
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing food and service. This was a fun restaurant downtown. I dont love this area but the food was definitely worth it.~evaharvard~New York City, New York
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best restaurant in town - the food is super delicous, I was here two times in a row and ordered almost everything on the card. The lobster crossini and lamb dish were probably my favourites. Try also the chocolate tard, very very good!  The only thing to complain was that it is a really noisy place - you could say the place really lives. So if youre looking for a quiet place this is not the restaurant to go.~Gregor K~Hausen
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great unusual combinations, extremely tasty food, spot on servers who don't intrude, prices that won't break the bank.~Kenbob~Hoboken, NJ
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I booked Bestia weeks ago based on feedback as I was visiting LA for the first time and enjoy new dining experiences. The restaurant is situated in an old warehouse and difficult to get to without your own car or cab but there is a valet parking service. Very busy restaurant and noisy because diners are talking loud over the open kitchen noise. It's very unusual that the cooking takes place in front of you but I would suggest this restaurant is best for groups of people as they also like to encourage diners to order dishes to share. This is not a restaurant for a quiet romantic meal. I don't think the food was particularly exceptional and expensive for what you received. This is supposed to be the hot ticket in town and there were waiting for tables you either get this place or you don't.....I didn't not for me sorry.~CrackingJohn~Cromer, United Kingdom
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Im not the easiest person to please when it comes to dining out.  Bestia had that 'wow" factor that I haven't felt in way too long!!! The service was fantastic, the ambiance was buzzing and the food was delicious.  We tried a bunch of things, including the bone marrow, faro salad, tomato salad, and I believe it was smoked fish with lentils.  The cocktail with peach and mezcal was one of the best drinks that I ever tasted.  If you are in LA or plan to visit, make a reservation in advance.~susantF1596TS~Miami, Florida
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Is there even really a question of whether you should eat here or not? Go. Order the veal tartare and the bone marrow. Thank me later. ~Eric B~Los Angeles, California
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was an incredible accomplishment to even be dining there at 7:30 Saturday night!  After endless attempts, I was finally able to get a Saturday night table instead of a Monday!  Sometimes nothing is available for more than a month - so persistence does pay off!  Quite a distance, so we got a room to enjoy dinner and make an evening of it.    Our request for a patio table was honored and we were seated promptly.  Inside was completely full and buzzing and lots of people outside hoping to squeeze in.  We brought a great petite syrah and the sommelier was super friendly and put it in a decanter (aka huge wine bottle) for us.  Our server was very nice, informative, and never rushed us.  It was difficult to decide how many things to order and I worried that four items plus dessert for two people would be too much but it seemed about right since some are very small portions.  These were our selections:  Veal Tartare Crostino. Small serving.  Very flavorful and unique.  We both really enjoyed it.  Definitely didn't have the same texture as other tartares we've had -- it was more creamy.  Maybe better for people nervous to try tartare.  Roasted bone marrow.  Or is it?  By the time the server scrapes it onto the gnocchi and stirs it together, it's really just another pasta with a lovely sauce on it.  Also did not detect the roasted breadcrumbs that were in the description.  As it seemed more like a pasta serving, we would probably try something else in next time around.  However, it is certainly a unique presentation of bone marrow.  It is also not a large portion.  Uni Spaghetti.  Having read so much about it, we gave it a go but afterwards I wished I'd ordered one of the other more pastas.  The Agnolotti all'Agnello sounded far more interesting.  The uni spaghetti didn't live up to my expectation.    Grilled Whole Branzino.  Perfectly prepared and excellent.  We eat allot of fish and this was my favorite dish.  My husband's favorite was the veal crostino.  The branzino was lovely.  Buttermilk Einkorn Cake.  We ordered this because my husband thought the description was great (caramelized honey & pear ice cream. candied lemon zest) and then our server said it was amazing.  Really?  Cornbread cake is amazing....  I was hoping to try the pear tart....  The cornbread cake was cornbread cake....the accompaniments did not elevate it that much.  We thoroughly enjoyed our evening, but it was due to the whole package of ambiance, fabulous service, as well as the food.  The food was very very good but we also temper it with the enormous effort to secure a table and a trek to L.A. to enjoy it.  It is on the pricey side and you have expectations.   Most of the dinner was excellent and some was very good.  Really glad we were able to finally experience dinner at Bestia!  Free parking nearby isn't too difficult if you don't mind walking a few minutes.    TIP on getting a reservation - check open table often and slots within the 72 hours often come up but you have to act fast before other people snap them up!~ALadyNCal~Laguna Niguel, CA
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's obvious why it's so difficult to get a reservation at Bestia. The food is just that amazing. A little tip if you're willing to sit at the bar. Just show up and you'll be sure to get a seat or two without too much waiting. The menu changes often and sometimes my favorite item disappears but no worries as the new selections are always amazing. The Sommelier is always helpful to suggest off the map wines to try.~DudeSteven~Los Angeles, California
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Terroni and Osteria Momma have better Italian food. The service staff here is among the most pretentious I've encountered and I work with restaurants throughout all of Los Angeles and Southern California. The pizza is so average it's laughable and the food is so overrated I truly don't understand the hype. I've eaten my way through Los Angeles and found this place to be one of the least memorable and pretentious LA pitfalls. Speaking from my heart, you can go anywhere and have food like this. Why put up with arrogant service staff and an overcrowded, stuffy, low lit room thats not even comfortable? Does that sound like a great night out to you? Again, don't buy into the hype. This restaurant is not for true foodies it's for the others. You'll waste a ton of money here on small portions of uninspired food and arrogant service staff. The wine list- hilarious. Obscure wines marked up beyond reason. Look any of the bottles up before you order- you'll see what I mean. Skip this place.~TonyB_real~Los Angeles, California
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place always has people waiting even after 10pm when we left.Very busy for a reason...the food is incredible! The vibe is upbeat & even though there were a lot of people you didn't feel crammed in or rushed.The staff are very attentive & helpful. We shared the food options to sample different things & think this is the best way to go unless very hungry as the portion sizes are very generous. Everything was outstanding as were the cocktails .Will def.be back but will get their earlier for a stand by table as we had a 45min wait from 8pm on a tuesday night.~Weeksy~Sydney
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place seems to be the new "in" place as a lot of my colleagues were raving about it and how hard it was to get in.  Needless to say, I went expecting that with all the hype, it was probably going to be a let down. Wrong!  Had the Branzino, Allanduja pizza, home made country bread and the Cavatelli.  It was a parade of gourmet delights!  The food was fresh, very tasty and very well presented.  For dessert had the strawberries and cream and a peach tart that was just to die for!  Definitely a hit!~Arknwarrior~California
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We booked about five weeks out through our hotel and were able to get a nice table for three. The place has a very great vibe with loud (but not too loud) music and a great din from the fellow dining crowd. Our server was terrific in recommending the appropriate amount of plates for our group of three and of all that we tried the tagliatelle was by far the best, a great melange of pork ragu, cabbage and a touch of creme. The wine steward was very on point in recommending a nice bottle of Cabernet Franc to go with our dishes.  Order of a few appetizers, a pizza and a few pasta dishes and you will walk away with a concept of new Italian cooking.~BellBoys60625~Chicago, Illinois
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had what was a really great meal here and our experience would have been perfect except that my wife had her purse stolen from her handbag. Be careful if you are sitting on stools at the chef 's table ( as in counter).  The stools are close together and this can easily happen.  I both called the restaurant and left a message for them to return my call and reached out to them by Facebook. Four days later I have had no response.  Really too bad because the food was quite good but the lack of response tells me that they are not really concern dabout their patron's experience.~davidknoxvilletn~Knoxville, TN
Bestia Restaurant~3731729~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We so enjoyed our initial meal here that we came back.  The food is delicious and mains are meant to be shared, so don't come if you're not into sharing.  Also, don't come if you value conversation; the noise level here is hurtful.  When we asked if the music could be turned down, the hostess said they consider loud music, kitchen din, and yelled conversation to be part of the ambiance!  So, no, they don't want you to hear the food descriptions, wine characteristics, or your table mates.  The herby branzino was generous and lemony and delicious.  The lamb neck was flavorful, tender and came with a generous salad.  The pasta dish, oxtail agnolotti, was yummy, but pretty skimpy when shared, as was the salas of cubes and persimmon.  Great food, decent service, but not worth the headache causing din.~rebmans~Los Angeles, California
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A really fun 'hole in the wall' with a unique menu...we went on Saturday morning in the rain...had to sit outside but added to the fun. Sat with other visitor and a few locals; friendly. A good spot to enhance the flavor of this great city...go and have fun.~medfordcouple~medford, oregon
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As an Englishman who has never had 'biscuits' (other than the type you have with a cup of tea), or grits, this place was recommended to us by our hotel and it was great. We got there early after a jet-lagged start to the day, and the staff and food were great. Good flavours and ingredients, and the popularity with local Seattlites is also a great sign! There are not many tables so you will be lucky to get a seat at busy times, but well worth a visit for a hearty breakfast. Staff were also friendly and welcoming which is important, especially for tourists and outsiders. And grits? Delicious, will be seeking these out again before I return home.~tomcallow~Kitwe, Zambia
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic for GF eaters. Although a bit like the day after a big night food. Good coffee and highly recommended.~Gina S~Weipa, Australia
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~For a surreal biscuit and gravy experience, this is the place. Great biscuits, good gravy, lots of available topping variations, and a 40 minute show on the sidewalk outside by what appeared to be a tweaked-out tai chi master/slow-mo hip-hop artist. Great service, and lots of snark. ~AKGRB~Anchorage, Alaska
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, great location.  The biscuits and breakfast options are pretty good.  I would visit this place again next time I'm in Seattle. ~CWTX1~Austin, Texas
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been made to rewrite this by TripAdvisor because it is not family friendly....even though the name of the restaurant has the specific word in question.  The name of the dish I am referring to in my review includes that word to which, I have put in quotes, "NAME OF RESTAURANT".  Golly this is silly.  This was a great biscuit and gravy shop! The gravy was white and thick with huge hunks of patty sausage. I had the Straight up "NAME OF RESTAURANT" with scrambled eggs and a black coffee. $12. There isn't a whole lot of table space and so there are tables outside. For late October, it's still manageable outside otherwise, you can stand and eat inside along a barely stable counter that isn't strong enough to hold small children, as their sign warns you. I can see why this is a go-to place for many folks in the morning. Who needs Starbucks in Seattle? Also, there are plenty of options for going vegetarian with mushrooms instead of sausage gravy and going gluten free as well for the biscuits!~zHojo~Prague, Czech Republic
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Me and my boyfriend were visiting Seattle and wanted to try something different for breakfast and this was definitely the place to go to. OMG! This place was the bomb.com Every bite was better and better, I am from Chicago and nothing compares to this. The line was long but it was well worth the wait.~jocelynhernandez32~Chicago, Illinois
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So delicious, and super fun vibe and staff. Affordable, good breakfast food. They have vegetarian options too.~SoloHiker411~Stamford, Connecticut
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by after taking the ferry from Bremerton and this place was simply amazing.  Great service!  The biscuit was fresh, the meat tender, their secret sauce is difference maker.  Will certainly go again~Fredrik G~Boston, Massachusetts
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place always has a line and is definitely nothing fancy.  However, it is worth the wait if you are hungry for a bowl full of bisquit and meats and/or dairy.  Skip lunch, you won't need it.  Go with a friend, one for ordering food and the other for finding a table (there are only a few).  Be hungry.  If you don't like hard core rap music you might consider ear plugs and leave the kiddos outside with grandma.  The chefs like their music and don't care if it offends you.  Quirky, funky, fun place to eat.  A goldmine in the middle of downtown.~Lisa M~Sarasota
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is famous, but as a vegetarian, I did not expect that it would hold much interest for me. Sausage gravy holds little appeal. I could not have been more wrong! My husband and I finally went and had not only great food, but a wonderful time!  The mushroom gravy is excellent as well as vegetarian, and the portions are generous. The biscuits were yummy and the coffee admirable too. The staff is hilarious as well as friendly, and the music cheerful when we were in there. It is a tiny space though. The people watching was superb given the ambience of the place. I will certainly return! ~Leone H~Fairbanks, Alaska, United States
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was the choice of my travelling companion on the last day of our trip! He chose well! This concept is like the biscuit version of Nachos. i got the Biscuits & gravy topped with bacon, eggs, and cheese. A soft giant fluffy biscuit topped with bacon, eggs and gravy, this place would fit right in here in Nashville! I only wish they had better seating arrangements inside. Due to the rain we had to stand at the bar & eat, it wouldve been even better to sit & enjoy our breakfast,but we will still add this place to our list of must eats when we return to seattle.~indyfan99~Nashville
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed the breakfast food. Most everyone working there were pleasant with the exception of one person. He tried to embarrass my wife because she was drinking a Star bucks coffee. His language and attitude in general were unwarranted and rude. I understand he was trying to be cool but over coffee? Anyway, I highly recommend the food. ~Jay C~Charlotte, North Carolina
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got breakfast here with 7 family members- each person ordered something different and was NOT disappointed. Might I recommend something with an egg AND gravy.~Charlie Y~Tampa, Florida
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got the cheese grits/gravy and egg biscuit.  I was actually surprised how well it was done-I was afraid that it was more style than substance but every thing was executed well.~92gregn~Kansas City, Missouri
Biscuit Bitch~4518802~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a unique place. The food is delicious. We were not at all disappointed in anything about our breakfast here. The biscuits are big & dense. Gravy is tasty. So many different choices that we would love to visit again. ~Judy C~Ogden, Utah
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A few weeks ago the Blue Duck Tavern was simply an absolutely reliable place for a delicious meal served by one of the best and nicest waitstaffs in the area. Then Michelin made it one of the few starred restaurants in DC!  The room is extremely comfortable, light, cheerful, and with just the right amount of ambient sound to let you know it's full of happy eaters. But never so loud it's hard to hold a conversation.  The food is delicious. Some of the best beef and fowl dishes in town, not to mention lighter fare including the best Reuben sandwiches outside of New York. I've never had a dish that misfired, and we go every couple of months.  But the very best dish on the menu is the apple pie for two. Light flakey crust; a mix of sweet and tart apples that gets the sweet and tart balance exactly right. The menu says "for two", but really the portion is enough for three if the table wants to share. Come to think of it, all of the BDT's dishes are very generous portions. The rest of the desserts are excellent; someday I'll m going to is it for a three course lunch. All desserts!  The waitstaff makes every group feel welcomed and a bit special. One of my party ordered a chicken dish and couldn't finish. So she requested the usual doggy bag. When we got home and opened the packet to pit the chicken in the fridge, we discovered that they had tucked in an additional freshly made breast! Truly classy.  One of the very best places for lunch and dinner in town. Not cheap, but still excellent value~FrequentTraveler137~Great Falls, Virginia
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beautiful restaurant in Park Hyatt hotel. I guess I hadn't read the reviews carefully because I was expecting an old, cosy pub ( the name threw me off), but the Blue Duck Tavern is very modern yet warm and inviting. I had mistakenly made a 7:30 a.m. Reservation not p.m. And it was a Friday night. They were very busy but managed to accommodate us in a glassed in booth in the bar area. Very private and less noisy. The first thing you see when you walk in are rows of individual apple pies by the open kitchen. Looked amazing so we knew we needed to order one for dessert. Fantastic. One of the best apple pies I have ever had. Loaded with fruit. The rest of our dinner was great too. I had the seafood stew and my husband had the scallops, both delicious. They have an extensive wine and drinks list that we also enjoyed. Service was great too. All in all a great place that I would return to in a minute when back in DC.~joellen0713~Connecticut
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Blue Duck Tavern is a beautiful restaurant with all sorts of meat dishes to make people happy. The interior is spacious and gorgeous, and the service is what you'd expect - impeccable.  Our table was close to the kitchen, so it wasn't necessarily quiet, but it was very cool seeing how the kitchen operated. The kitchen is completely open as if it is part of the restaurant, not hidden in the back. It's very cool.   The menu was simple, and everything tasted so good. Get the poached pear salad! It's to die for, especially during fall. Our waiter also ended up giving us a complimentary full size dessert aside from the one we ordered. It was so nice!   I can definitely see why Blue Duck Tavern is consistently rated one of the best restaurants in DC. Check it out!~Alexandra R~Las Vegas, Nevada
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dined with a colleague   Had oysters, duck and crab cake. They are wonderful.  Also the server, David was the best of all. Friendly and provided a wonderful service. Will definitely come back.~548kyoko~Tokyo, Japan
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I don't give very many 5 stars to restaurants but it would be difficult to do otherwise in Blue Duck Tavern's case. From the very start the service was genuine and thoroughly professional. The manager even provided a brief tour of the modern and magnificent kitchen. The poached pear salad and the roasted bone marrow were delicious. Main courses of dry aged ribeye for two and a foulard duck with a blueberry reduction were even more so. Apple pie for two is a must. I have already made another reservation.~RJManey~Charlottesville, Virginia
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I once lived in Washington as a student many years ago, a situation which gives one a unique perspective on any city. To pay for my many expensive habits such as wine, women and amateur dramatics I took a job as a Washington guide (yes I had a badge too) and spent 8 very interesting and enjoyable months mixing my scholastic life of learning with my guiding source of income as light relief and a way of considerably widening my social circle. I was astounded at the number of people, most of whom were American who wanted to know more about their capital city. In the course of that time I naturally ate quite a lot of food I did not cook myself on a more or less 24/7 basis. You learn a lot about restaurants when you stand between them and their presumptive clientele. One thing I learned was the very odd nature of Brunch in DC. There are a lot more upmarket hotels in Washington now than there where then. Everything from the craziness of interstellar cuisine such as Minibar to some very pedestrian places we will not be discussing. But on Sunday everything seems to shift gear just ever so slightly. Washington is a city of politicians but diplomats too, and their consular and ambassadorial staff. Of course politicians tend to disappear at the weekends except in times of national catastrophe, such as the present election. But normally Washington at the weekend is home to relaxing foreigners and avid tourists. Not forgetting a fair number of students from the high echelon end of the local universities out to show themselves just how sophisticated they are. The result is odd. Restaurants serving normal set meals dive into a completely American conception of Brunch. A sort of boozy breakfast with no hold bars. I am no stranger to the whole thing but oddly enough my favourite place for brunch is the Hyde Park Hilton at the Top of the Tower restaurant or whatever it is called. You will not have a more zany experience in your life. Not so in Washington. Here it is all much tribal. "Oh no we never go south of M for brunch.", "they always choose those tacky little places down by the river.".  And if you reserve for Brunch (and you have to reserve at anywhere creditable) then you must be prepared for some new experiences.  Entering the Blue Duck is a bit odd because you have to find the door which is not self-evident. I mean, it is that upmarket. But not really discrete, because this is a big floor area with open kitchens (you practically walk through them) around the prep area before the plates are trays are carried out. It is all very, very pretentious. More like visiting a large department store with no counters, just tables. Why it was necessary to use the "Tavern" in the name escapes me. Perhaps they thought the magical reference to treasured ideas of merry dining in a rustic atmosphere would strike a chord? I think not. Modern, Scandinavian with a slight hint of something like Indian modern (think Delhi HIlton).  My first reaction was to try and persuade my host that perhaps a walk back to the Hotel over the road would be better, or even to try and join the queue for free breakfast (the restaurant provides this service for a nearby hotel). But we were there, food is not life, does it really matter etc. So we settled for an outside table to avoid the monotonous drone of the regulars to relax in the open air. Washington can be perfect at this time of year and the brisk walk had generated an appetite. Our server, helper, table assistant whatever they call themselves at this place introduced herself which was nice, but unnecessary and obviously was confused. We did not look or sound like tourists but we were not with the rest of the tribes inside. So there was deference and some caution as the menu was inspected and the first surprise appeared. There was no Lunch. There was Brunch - a fairly short and uninspiring menu - and that was it. The kitchen would be open for dinner but nothing in the a la carte was available until then. Then it became clear to me what was going on. The Blue Duck is American. The menu was quite simply trying to accommodate some American tastes in a mostly it catered to dishes that were a little unusual but less important as food than tribal trophies. "have you tried the ribs at Blue Duck etc". That is not a Brunch. A Brunch is a groaning buffet of breakfast delights usually with something more substantial available, a carvery for example. And champagne included either mixed or by itself.  So with the limited menu and the small servings of slightly warmed food we thankfully spent the entire time talking in the fresh air. The members of the tribes had homes to go to and we saw several exoduses during the time we were there.  I would like to visit the Blue Duck again, but not for Brunch, not unless they have a real  brunch, whatever the elders in the tribe think.~Iain W~Midlothian, Virginia
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It almost seems a waste of time to post another laudatory review of the Blue Duck Tavern but that is how utterly brilliant they are: we just love going back. We celebrated a birthday last night and the food was as spectacular as ever - simply prepared tip-top quality produce - service excellent and the setting (outdoor table) simply perfect. We took advantage of the restaurant's BYO policy to drink two of our favorite wines at a reasonable corkage fee (for expensive stuff). One (small) matter which deserves attention: the home-made bread is good but could be much better still...~T V~London, United Kingdom
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was a parent's weekend get together and couldn't have been happier.  The food was incredible from the bone mre arrow app to rabbit, chicken and scallops.  Our server was timely, pleasant and a great server.  The price unexpectly low, considering there were five of us.  I loved the atmosphere and would dine there again for sure.~Tamara N~Charleston, South Carolina
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our dining experience was highlighted by our waiter who from the time he introduced himself was engaging and enthusiastic.  His descriptions of the food were spot on.  We made sure to order a variety of dishes and shared them around the table - all were excellent.  The wine selection is complementary to the menu and has several interesting selections.  Would definitely return.~Nolads~New Orleans, Louisiana
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service is excellent.  Truly attentive servers.  The food is very good, though also very pricey.  Brunch for 3 totaled over $70.00, so that's one expensive breakfast sandwich!  But, for a special occasion, I would not hesitate to book the chef's tasting or other private dining area.~CherylD536~Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very pleasant dinner once we found our way inside.  There was not a clear pathway to the dining room (through hotel entrance). We ended up in the kitchen and had to be directed to the dining area.  We saw at least 4 other couples being redirected, so I didn't feel so bad.  The bread was wonderful - warm and crusty.  We started with the Oven-Roasted Bone Marrow which was very good. I also had the soup of the day which was a type of cabbage soup; very tasty.  I had the Prime Steak which was perfectly prepared.  My husband had the Cheshire pork chop which he raved about. For sides we had the white corn grits which were fantastic.  We also tried the BDT fried which were fried mashed potatoes cut into wedges.  They were ok, but would not order them again.  Dessert was apple pie for 2 (which could have served 4).  It was also average. The best part of the dessert was the homemade vanilla ice cream which was served in a big vase like container.  It was a nice dinner, but pricey.  ~DanaRN2014~Mahwah, New Jersey
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were hotel guests. Reservation not honored after being confirmed. Hostess was extremely rude and finally admitted she was hesitant to seat us because we had small service dog. Although I had documentation with me she did not know how to handle the situation except to be rude and ignore us. That is unacceptable and discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Staff was not trained and very unprofessional all the way around. For example, we were not served at the same time, one guest ten minutes before the other. One plate cleared while the other still eating. Not in any way fine dining. The food was ordinary, restaurant was noisy, unappealing and is far over rated in my opinion. Very unpleasant dining experience when we were finally seated after waiting more than hour.~ServiceDog2014~New York City, New York
Blue Duck Tavern~622172~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were visiting our son in DC and were looking for a nice restaurant to take him and his friend. We hit the jackpot. Our server, Adrienne, was simply the best. She had the most extensive knowledge of the menu that we have ever experienced! She even got my husband to try brussel sprouts, which he previously abhorred...and he (and all of us) LOVED them. Our compliments to the chef (and lovely Adrienne).~MAEBC~Kinnelon, New Jersey
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~ As stated on the wall, " donuts for grown-ups." Fantastic favors. We had the raspberry buttermilk that was infused with rosemary, and was so flavorful throughout...not just the icing, but the cake itself ( unlike Voodoo). We had the Mexican hot chocolate, which had a deep, dense chocolate flavor with a very spicy accent. The orange olive oil was so delicious, I cannot find the words. The final was Meyer lemon with key lime curd. Talk about tart! We give blue star a gold star! They will be the gold standard of donuts for us. So, a warning about parking-- do not park in the lot, even if the stores there are closed...predatory private parking police will give you a ticket anyway. You can call and have it voided, but it is a hassle. ~travellerfromatown~Allentown, Pennsylvania
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~. . . or endlessly ponder the health benefits of their products.  And even if you don't like donuts adhere to long prevailing local advice--Just do it!  Pick one flavored on the inside or coated on the outside with something you like . . . or one that simply looks good to you--and bite into it.  You just might become a convert.~Randall-Anne~Lodi, California
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Blueberry-Bourbon-Basil donut...it's a beautiful thing. Thanks Blue Star for starting my day out right.~643PennyB~Kelowna, Canada
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the chocolate buttermilk glazed donut- I am not sure of the actual name.  I also tasted the lemon and the old fashioned.  They were all delicious.  They are a bit pricey, but I would agree with their signage that states they are about quality over quantity. ~alexespo5~Saratoga Springs, New York
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Once you've done the obligatory "pink box" donut experience in Portland, head over to Blue Star Donuts for the gourmet hand-made donut for adults.  Every day, they follow a laborious classic brioche recipe (takes 18 hours to make) which originated in the south of France.  Top notch ingredients (including cage-free eggs, hormone-free milk, European-style butter) combined with a passion for excellence create a memorable experience.  Blueberry Bourbon Basil, anyone?~DandLtravel~Burbank, California
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Real treat in the mornings at weekends but prepare for a line. Great experience in every way though.  Must try ~michaelmT9346QQ~Portland, Oregon
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Some say Voodoo is the place for doughnuts, but that's because they haven't had Blue Star. They are very well made and really melt in your mouth. Of course they are more expensive, but it's totally worth it. Definitely a place I see meeting up with friends. And if you're still hungry, Waffle Window is just down the street!~Priscilla C~Savannah, Georgia
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by after doing happy hour sushi nearby.  No lines like when I was on my way to the sushi spot, but only 2 types of donuts left (but they gave me mine free)~Larry R~Portland, Oregon
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The donuts are more expensive but so worth it. Not the place to get loads of donuts but great for a exciting treat with unique flavors~adamsra_23~Queens, New York
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The last time we were in Portland, there was only Voodoo Doughnut. This trip, we wanted to check out Blue Star (which is interesting, since we usually don't eat doughnuts, at all).  Blue Star's flavors are a bit unusual, and not super-sweet, which is nice. The blueberry basil has a good flavor, although I really enjoyed my mango with cocoa nibs (which had a bit of zing).~Naberius~Chicago, Illinois
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~These aren't gluten free so I was not able to partake but the persons around me enjoyed these donuts with relish. The beignets were not considered a favorite - they were deemed by the resident beignets expert that they were flavorless- but the raspberry donut and another donut with some alcohol injector was also voted very tasty. These disappeared quickly so I take that as a good sign. Enjoy with some drinking chocolate from Cacao around the corner. ~Valerie H~Vancouver, Washington, United States
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They had a limited selection of average size and taste doughnuts for much more than any other place without their reputation!~Richard O~Rochester
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~To be fair, I'm not a huge donut person but all the locals swear by this place. It is actually really good, better than VooDoo with overall flavor.~TXDG~Ripon, California
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited this donut shop based on recommendation of hotel. Was surprised to find no line after being open for an hour but was a rainy morning. Chocolate almond donut was just ok but I purchased 2 more for the rest of my trip so I'm optimistic. Store was clean, service was average. ~Donna H~Phoenix, Arizona
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been to Blue Star at least 1 time a month for the past year (we live 35 miles away so it's a bit of a trip). We love all the amazing flavors they offer. Made fresh and when they are out that day they are out...so go early. Definitely a must visit if your on vacation in Portland or if your local definitely put it on your to-do list.~Tom G~Sherwood, Oregon
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked in and thought they had sold out...the stock was in drawers behind the display!!  Five of us each had a different donut flavor and we each raved about how good they were.  Recommend you try...however, they are not inexpensive!!~JRottie~Bend, Oregon
Blue Star Donuts~3878569~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yummy, creative donuts!  I would probably enjoy more as dessert than breakfast, but they sell out by evening.  We stopped in on a Fri at 9am and no crazy lines.  Don't think you can go wrong with any donut, all looked good.  After enjoying these donuts, did not see the need to stand in the long lines at Voodoo donuts.~SavvyNYC1~New York City
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend and I went for lunch, reservations needed, when you get out of your car and you smell  the air you know something good is going on.  With the rustic surroundings the bar-b-qua fits right in. The food we had was fantastic. I had pork & bake potato with cole slaw. The servings were very large and very good. I had a box to go. My friend had brisket on a bun. It was huge! Also very good.  This is definitely a repeat!~Donna S~PHOENIX, United States
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Despite the Uber driver's effort to make our mind change,  we followed our guts and our dedication for ribs and insisted on thi place. Good decision! In the last 2 weeks we took all TA advice on bbq places. This was far the best. Great atmosphere, kind staff and delicate food. Oh boy, that rib! :)~Kata0229~Szentendre, Hungary
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent barbecue restaurant!! Food is great, nice atmosphere, very professional staff. The BBQ chicken and potatoes is something to try!!! If you are a beef eater....I guess that is good too!! ~mandmstables~Phoenix, Arizona
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic service, beautiful food and great surrounds. We came for lunch on a Tuesday and we're well looked after by our waiter. We SHARED a HALF size ribs and it was well enough for my husband and I! Highly recommend for those in Phoenix :)~jemmah3~Christchurch, New Zealand
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was awesome.. never will forget the experience.. the full slab of ribs were great and honestly the best ribs in the Phoenix area... 2 thumbs up..  ~Whoadie~New Orleans, Louisiana
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~For those people who live on the west side, but would like an "Eastside" experience, this is the place to go. This place is a hidden gem, which provides ambiance, great service, and a clientele that doesn't make you cringe. I often wonder what happened to the good 'ol days when the employees were supposed to provide service with courtesy, and a smile. I hate to say it, but the Westside doesn't have a great selection of patronage that dresses with respect, or refrains from loud, and disruptive language. This place allows you to feel good about going out to eat. In addition to this, the food is INCREDIBLE! There is a multi dimensional menu that caters to appetites of all flavors, BBQ or not. I have never had an average meal. They have chicken, beef, and pork ribs, sausage, brisket, vegetarian plates, AND they cater for holidays! Lastly, don't forget the doughnuts! Now THAT is icing on the cake. Don't pass this place up, totally worth a night out...~DoctorCleo~Phoenix, Arizona
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are hankerin' for some really good bbq this is your place.  No dried out slabs of tasteless bbq.  Bobby Q's has meaty ribs that are full of flavor thanks to some incredible choices of sauces and great meats.  These are fall off the bone ribs  that melt in your mouth.  I've tried practically every option here in the valley and these are the best.  Even the side dishes are amazing.  Can't go wrong so try anything on the menu that suits your fancy.  Plus they give you a little bag a cute baby sugared donuts when you leave...hot off the griddle.  Dang just talking about it has made me HUNGRY!~karenmR9124QS~Phoenix
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In town for some soccer and decided to stop here based on the reviews, #5.  I started with the Cajun shrimp, it was just ok, the sauce wasn't very spicy or flavorful and the garlic toast was not toasted very well.  The wedge salad didn't have much bacon and really wasn't presented well.  Skinny fries were good, the Mac and cheese was good but really rich.  Big portions. Anyways I think the best part was the bill because they give you warm doughnuts!! I hate to say this because I rely on Trip Advisor heavily, I don't think this restaurant comes close to the 5 it was ranked, if I had to put a number on it, it would have 3 digits. ~Luv2Adventure~Colorado
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was our first time! Loved the atmosphere, smell,and the general vibe was great. Our food was good, service was great, and mgr was friendly, we will go back!~L Y~Phoenix, Arizona
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service was great! Place was crowded and smelled good! Food was very delicious! Quality restaurant. Went with 3yr old and 6yr old...they enjoyed food also!!!  ~missromania2~detroit
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Terrific variety of classic BBQ meats.  They even have a gluten-free menu.  Excellent service from hostess to waiter.  We three had the combo spare ribs with sausage, brisket with spare ribs, and my gluten free friend had straight up brisket as well.  So delicious we devoured it.  The corn bread they came with was great,  We were so happy to be there.  The atmosphere was rustic and fun.  Another must go destination when in Phoenix.~connois~Hadley, Massachusetts
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is delicious. The atmosphere is very nice. Great for dates or family meals. It can get expensive quickly. My nay piece of advice is park as close to the door as you can. The back of the lot is not well lit in my opinion. I am all about safety! ~Brandy E~Phoenix, Arizona
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place as been on my "to do" list for quite a while and I am so glad I finally made it!  Since I am from Chicago, I'm always on the look out for good ribs - it's not like home but it's a good substitute!  Mac and Cheese was yummy - you must try the Q Rolls and the Bread Pudding was fabulous! If you are lucky enough to have Aspen wait on you then it's a really good visit!  Highly Recommend!~Patricia58P~Buckeye, Arizona
Bobby Q~677283~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited for lunch after an appointment close by. The combo barbecue platter was delicious !   The service was excellent : nice , friendly waiter. Food came up quickly. There was even a desert treat to take with for later. Although the brisket was softer ( over cooked), it was tasty and came up hit. The mac and cheese was really good, as were the ribs. The platter would have been enough to share! The corn bread was awesome! I wish the restaurant was closer to my house!  ~Judy S~Phoenix, Arizona
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A lovely dining experience for those who crave Chech beer, goulash, potatoes, and sour cream. This is not peasant food, it's high-end, high fat, deliciousness that is surprisingly delicately prepared and presented. Bring your appetite, some Prilosec, and have at it. Yummy!~Scott_R_Seattle~Seattle, Washington
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here on a Wednesday to celebrate my fiance's birthday. He loves German food so I thought this would be a great place to try. We were not dissapointed! The food was excellent, we had the beef cheek pierogi, chicken paprikash, and the short rib dish that I can't remember the exact name for. Anywho, it was all delicious.They also brought out complimentary chocolate custard and it was delightful. Service was absolutely fantastic, great location downtown....we'll definitely be back!~WhitneyW83~Chicago
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lots of ethic restaurants in Chicago but this one a bit different.  Hungarian, Austrian, Czech, etc. influences.  Nice, lively atmosphere, very good service.  If you look food from innards not on most restaurant menus this is the place.   I passed on sweetbreads, liver, etc. but had a great Hungarian Langos for an appetizer and goulash for dinner and coworker had very good chicken paprikash.   Good wine and drink selection and even had Tokai for a dessert wine.~stan l~Timbuktu, Mali
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the atmosphere in this place and the beer selection. Food was tasty, although over-priced. My family is Hungarian-Croatian and there is no way I'm paying $29 for Goulash or many of the other classics on the menu.  That said, very much enjoyed my meal here. Staff was great, beers great (as mentioned) and food tasty and extremely well presented. I've just been a bit spoiled by eating all at growing up made by my grandmother.~Sfhahn~Napa, California
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I dined here this past August and we still talk about how amazing our meal was.  We travelled to Chicago for our wedding anniversary, and we wanted to try something that we otherwise wouldn't have access to.  We travel very often and always make a point to try new restaurants, but Bohemian House stands out amongst the best dining experiences we have had in a few years.    Our waitress was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive.  I can't recall her name, however she was from Wisconsin and we had a great discussion about football rivalries.  Upon learning that my wife and I had travelled here for our anniversary, she provided us with complimentary dessert, which was not expected but was definitely appreciated.    The food was something we had had never experienced before and was delicious.  The chicken paprikash, spatzle, and Hungarian langos were all amazing.  I can't remember that last time I have been this impressed with food that I had never heard of before, let alone eaten.  I would absolutely make it a point to go out of my way to dine here again the next time I am in Chicago.  Over the years the restaurants often just begin to blur together, however Bohemian House still stands out months after dining there.~Dan J~Miramichi, Canada
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not everybody is into Central European food; the Bohemian House may help change your mind. Our first visit was last night, November 5, 2016, but it won't be our last. So popular we could not obtain an reservation, we decided to show up anyway and hope for a seat at the bar which we got. However, they have a community table option which allowed us good seating and a chance to meet others..  Observations: the hostesses were most welcoming, making sure we stayed and enjoyed their place. The service was excellent, or to look at it in a different light - professional. Really reminded us of experiences in good European restaurants. The food was great; I had the pork schnitzel and my wife the hunter's goulash. Super. This is not a large restaurant, but the ambiance is comfortable crowded, if that makes sense. A lot of chatter, but all convivial - makes one feel welcome. And the apple strudel for dessert was a fine finishing touch, with good coffee. The end? No.  Our son was in town for a trade show at McCormick Place; he had a business dinner earlier, but we wanted to have a nightcap at the Bohemian House, so he showed up later to meet us there. We had left, but returned for that chance to meet with our son. Once again the folks were great, helping us to obtain seats at the bar for that nightcap. We - and our son - will be back. Quality and professionalism make a difference; there are plenty of places to eat, but not that many in which to dine well.  One final touch; the restaurant has a definite Austro-Hungarian flavor, and there was a print on the wall attributed to Czech artist Alphonse Mucha. The village scene incorporated into the print was a section  of my wife's Bavarian home town, the medieval walled city Rothenburg ob der Tauber. How did they know she would be there!!?? It is called the Ploenlein - photo attached.   We really enjoyed our night there - I think you will too.~aibling~Aurora, Ohio
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service and the food was great.  We were warned it was pricey so we were prepared.  However, if we had not been told we would have been shocked.  Don't recommend bringing anyone under 16.  Not sure what they would choose to eat.  .~Grampa1951~Dorrance, Kansas
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place serves the most delicious eclectic european meals.  For apps we ordered the Beef Cheek Pierogi.  I've never had pierogi like this.  Also, the Pate was very good. For dinner, there are only 7 entrees on the menu but so much care goes into each one - absolute perfection.  Our faves are the Spatzle which is unbelievable, also the Chicken Paprikash.  Portions are generous so we've not been able to have dessert, but i imagine they are wonderful as well.    The service is great...everyone is so attentive and professional.  We sat close to the kitchen and it was delightful to watch the chefs work so well together and create such beautiful dishes.   The decor has a fun Bohemian vibe...the front of the restaurant has a very inviting sitting area with posh couches and oversized cushy chairs.    If you're in the downtown Chicago area, this restaurant was a real treat.  ~sherrybluemoonluck~Brentwood, Tennessee
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unusual dishes and drinks. The food presentation was beautiful and the food itself delicious: pierogi, duck, chicken and spatzel followed by apfel strudel and something chocolaty. The highlight was trying the becherovka!~hanlievanwyk~Chicago, Illinois
Bohemian House~7003196~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to dinner with friends to try out the Bohemian House and we all loved it.  The service was top notch.  The manager stopped by our table multiple times.  Food was excellent and very flavorful.  Also enjoyed the treats from the chef.  Don't expect typical German or Eastern European fare - the chef does a nice twist on typical dishes that are excellent.  Save room for the apple strudel - you won't be disappointed.  We plan on returning to try out their weekend brunch and their lunch sometime soon.~Diane K~Chicago, Illinois
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Boka is my quintessential favorite restaurant:  Small and unassuming, almost casual, with excellent service and amazing food.  Their menu is largely seasonal, but always creative and interesting--you can have meat, or not, but you will eat well.  Trust yourself to the sommelier, especially if you're going to match wines to individual courses--they do this really well and it it makes a big difference in the overall experience.  Boka is a seriously good restaurant.  Go. Enjoy. ~exbruxelles~Redwood City, California
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't go to Boka hungry! The food is imaginative and delicious, but the portions are minuscule. We had the roasted carrots as an appetizer, and they were outstanding, but the seafood "chowder" was a stark white, very unappetizing in appearance and overly salty. The loup de mer and beef short rib entrees were very good. The overall ambiance of Boka is elegant and subdued without being formal. It was nice and quiet, too, which was a welcome change from restaurants where you have to shout to be heard! One warning: the restrooms are down a flight of stairs and might pose a challenge to some. ~stephanieaE9143TW~Palo Alto
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic cocktails, an extensive wine list and some of the best food I've ever eaten at this restaurant.  The prices are moderately high but the food is well worth it - seemed like a good value.  Very friendly and helpful staff!~Robert B~Portland, Oregon
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great ambience - not pretentious - upscale but comfortable. Service was spot on - waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  Food was absolutely outstanding. The dishes all offer a combination of textures and flavours that won't disappoint. One of the best meals I have ever had. ~livetotravel50~Vancouver BC
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like sweet bread, octopus, pork belly, aged duck, you will not be disappointed.  Every dish was well prepared and services were friendly.  ~Kallen C~San Mateo, California
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Impeccable service, the food was out of this world and the place has a wonderful atmosphere and design. My only note would be to mark that step between the two dining rooms - I overheard the waiters multiple times telling customers to watch their step and it got me too.~Anda_ambrosini~San Francisco, California
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food preparation and presentation was good quality and cleverly constructed. The beets were a highlight as was the fois gras dish, although everything provided interest.   The broad list of wines from the Loire was fun to select from and our 1985 Chinon and Sancere and Chenin blanc  choices were very pleasing. The food clearly is prepared to be well matched with the wines of the Loire region of France.   The service is a bit casual as is the plate ware - ceramic style was a bit out of character for the artistic flare of the place. It is an unusual decor of dark walls and brash lighting but it works. It just has a feeling of edge or creative attempt. A rather large space it still feels intimate but not totally so. ~CalgaryTraveller58~Calgary, Canada
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant is whimsical and wonderful, the live wall adds character. We had the 9 course tasting menu with the paired wines.  We appreciated that they had a Corvina allowing much nicer wines to be served by the glass as opposed to only by the bottle. It was also nice that they clean the table between every meal.  Course 2 (we both gave it an 8 of 10): very original, incredibly light.shrimp head are fantastic . The shrimp perfectly balanced   Course 3 (we gave it a 8 and 7 of 10 respectively):  the pairing was perfect the earthiness with the heirloom Tomato is superb and the flavor in the tomatoes is mmmmmm you can feel the explosions of flavor on your palate.  Course 4 (we gave it a 5 and 6 of 10 respectively): ravioli simply delicious! Contrast between sweet corn, corn, black truffles and the cheese! Black truffle shine. Combination of flavor give you an amazing experience   Course 5 (we both gave it 10 of 10 ): monkfish perfectly cooked. Very nice dish. Not a wow dish. Perfectly seasoning.   Course 6  (we gave it a 8.5 and 9 of 10 respectively):  the smoked duck compliments the sweetbreads and rounds out the dish. It's light and each bite is perfectly textured due tithe perpetration   Course 7 (we gave it a 5 and 6 of 10 respectively): pork perfectly cooked but the protein didn't complement each other. Interesting contrast but not a fantastic dish.  Course 8 (we both scored it 4/10): light and refreshing, flavorful but not inspired (basil ice cream). The pairing was not good with the tokay but wonderful with the scotch.  Course 9 (we both scored it 5/10): great pairing with the espresso but more the continuation of the first dessert.different flavor but still ice cream (hazelnut).  Our waiter (Alisandro) was friendly and very knowledgeable, however two different members of the staff reached across us while we were chatting to give us new cutlery (rather unexpected in this level of restaurant)  Very convenient for public transport, the washroom were nice with cloth towels. They also have very comfortable chairs that let us enjoy our 4 hours meal.~Peter_Bomberg~Ottawa, Canada
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of the best restaurants in Chicago.   Situated in Lincoln Park, we arrived and received a warm greeting from the hostess and shown to our table.  Our waiter introduced himself and was professional, attentive, friendly but in no way obtrusive.   We ordered a cold appetizer of roasted carrots with pistachio, dates and smoked feta to share. We followed with Roasted Suckling Pig with kohlrabi, figs and mustard and grilled Spanish octopus with cucumber, cauliflower and Morcilla. All were beautifully presented and outstanding in execution.  For Entrees we had slow roasted beef short rib with eggplant, grilled tongue and grilled tomatoes and roasted chicken with charred sweet potato, quince and Fois Gras.   We accompanied the meal with an excellent Sancerre and sparkling mineral water then followed with cheese and Oolong tea.   At about $130 per person including wine and tip, it was good value for an outstanding dining experience. ~Michael L~Sydney, Australia
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived and the our waiter greeted my wife with "Happy Birthday Dawn". The rest of the evening continued with the attentive services. We went with the tasting menu, with accompanying Austrian and Hungarian wines. The 7 courses were excellent and just a taste so you were able to finish the experience feeling satisfied but not full. The wine were a great match to the courses. Excellent service, meal and setting. Will go back next time we are in Chicago.~lucus82~Whitby, Canada
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We celebrated my 50th birthday here and had a wonderful experience. The place is really cool. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Two slight complaints - the bartender spilled a class of water that got on my pants and didn't offer anything beyond a quick apology. We ordered a couple of appetizers and the duck and the waiter confirmed that was an appropriate amount of food. Turns out the duck could have easily served 4 people so we could only finish half of it. The wine list is wonderful and our waiter made a great recommendation. I would recommend this place for a special outing. ~Tim B~Saint Louis, Missouri
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We celebrated our anniversary here. If this restaurant were anyplace else, it would be the best place in town. Instead, it is overshadowed by Alinea, one of the best restaurants in the world. Delicious food and impeccable service.~phillytraveler71~Chicago, Illinois
Boka Restaurant~430770~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While visiting Chicago to do the marathon, my wife and I celebrated our 48th wedding anniversary PLUS my wife's birthday, so we chose BOKA after a little research for the special place.  From the coat check to the pre-dinner drink at the bar, the staff and management represented the highest of professionalism. The 'speciality' drink menu was equally worthy of this restaurant's Michelin rating, and bar patrons were delighting in sharing the quality of those drinks.  Once seated, we were welcomed by our server and the maitre'd and we began a wonderful relaxed 2 1/2 hour dinner.  From the starters of marinated yellowtail to the roasted carrots, we followed with a shellfish chowder and crispy sweetbread, each having unique combinations of flavour and colour. There is a reason the chef is recognized as a master in the art of plating. Our entrees were perfection (lamb loin and belly - and beef short ribs) followed by a dessert of milk chocolate, fig, chai and sour cream.  Beyond the various courses, the attentive staff and chef followed with special platings with greetings for both the anniversary and birthday celebrations.  Simply the best!~marlinman9~Canada
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A beautiful venue- lots of twinkling lights and not far from where a lot of my family was staying for a wedding- the Biltmore!  Very noisy- I couldn't talk over the noise so if you want an intimate dinner, not a place I would seek out.  The salad was excellent, very fresh and the dressing light and flavorful. Most of us split a few fire grilled pizzas- good but not great- fresh ingredients but the sauce was a little sour and too much on the pizzas so instead of being super crispy, they were somewhat gloppy!  My brother in law had the carbonara and it came with a poached egg to mix in. He said it was very good. The bakery items looked wonderful, but we ate at 11 pm and being from the east coast- just couldn't do sweets at my 2 am. I thought it was very pricey- an ok glass of wine was 19.00- would have said that is just LA, but had some delicious meals with better wine at several other places.~SOSMindy~Burke, Virginia
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As for restaurants in LA go, this place has pretty good food. No complaints at all with the quality or quantity. The service was better than some of the other places we visited during out week out in LA. We had a group of 11 or 12 and the waiter was spot on. Thank you for a great dining experience, would for sure visit again.~jasonsbiz~Avon
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Bottega Louis is an amazing experience, lovely environment, delicious & beautiful food and pastries.  The service is also the best--~rlakehouse~Hunters
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Burger was ok on first taste but became flaccid, cold and heavy after 3 bites with too much lettuce and a cheap patty. My first cocktail was so bad I had to send it back but the waiter kindly replaced it with a better Old Fashioned. Generally a pretty underwhelming experience.  For the money I expect more. Must try harder.~malcolm79~London
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Can across the restaurant by chance, once we tasted the food and experienced the service we were hooked. we went back many times. The size of the meals are huge, and the pizza for only $22 will easily feed for of you. I recommend the Mushroom Soup or the Onion Soup. For those not dining, the restaurant is famous for the pastries, you will think you are in France with the variety and quality.~Petros14~Gold Coast, Australia
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Expected a wait on a Friday night, so no big deal. We were seated at a large, round table for our party of 6, which was big enough, but since we had the wall on one side, and another table very close on the other, we were separated into 3 on either side of the table. The place is loud, and since the table was large and round, it wasn't like sitting at a rectangular dinner table or a booth, we were pretty far from each other. Fortunately, the table next to us finished up and we were able to move it over a bit and sit closer to one another. The service was great and the food all looked delicious. I tried the carbonara at the suggestion of the waiter and it was fantastic.  I'd walked by this place many times when I lived in the area, but hadn't been until now. I'm glad I got to give it a try and wouldn't hesitate to return.~abbyhillb~Los Angeles, California
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fast, good service, good food. nice atmosphere. It really feels like you're in a downtown manhattan restaurant without the hassle.~101johnnyboi~Los Angeles, California
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First ate at Bottega Louie about 5 years ago while in LA on business. I've been back a half dozen times since. High ceilings and hard floors (I believe marble but can't say for sure bc I travel a lot and places start to blend together) and festive atmosphere means it's a loud environment. Noise doesn't bother me but some might find it less enjoyable.  The service is always good and the food is always very good. I've tried a variety of apps, salads, pizzas, and entrees and have enjoyed everything I tried. Worth a visit for lunch or dinner when in downtown LA.~johncrab911~Moorestown, New Jersey
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I stopped here to get myself some of the macaroons I saw through the window. You pick your own and they come packaged in a lovely lilac colored box that I kept as a keepsake souvenir! They were quite tasty!~Tamesha O~Madison Heights, Virginia
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My boss took me and a co-worker here for our birthdays and we did like the place. Good Italian food in a comfortable setting...right here in downtown L.A. The decor of this restaurant is modern, yet cozy...and our meals were really tasty. It's a good place for taking a business associate, or simply go with friends for some good grub! I'd recommend this place, I'd definitely go back.~GermaicanSpiceGirl~Los Angeles, California
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friends had been ravaing about this place so i finally gave in and went.  Unbelievably noisy; the food was only average and not well priced.  I put it on my miss list"~Carl J~Woodland Hills, Ca
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped here for brunch prior to going to the theatre at the Ahmanson. Great breakfast. Amazing dessert displays. A bit noisy ambiance.~sbeukema~Huntington Beach, California
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had such a wonderful late lunch at Bottega Louie. Our server Janine was superb. The food presentation was artistic and every dish we had was delicious. The portobello mushrooms sticks with the dip was out of this world. The salad was fresh and the two meat main courses were perfectly cooked. Our server Janine was friendly and very pleasant and efficient. We will surely come again as it became one of our favorite restaurants ~WRashed~Kuwait City, Kuwait
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ordered the Margherita and a Pepperoni pizza. We also ordered the modena and arugula salad. We pizza crust was nice and crisp. I thought the sauce on the pizza was just ok. The sauce had a strong acid taste and it needed to be toned diwn some. The desserts were really good and it was quite interesting to see the chefs cooking. The main issue I had with the restaurant was the noise. All surfaces are hard the the noise bounced off the hard surfaces. It was difficult to have conversations with anyone at your table. I felt out waiter was excellent. He was efficient and friendly. ~doupnikka~Roanoke, Virginia
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in to pick up dessert to go. They have a great selection. I got tiramusi. When i got back to the hotel someone told me the macaroons are amazing. The tiramusi was really good.~Autumn M~Stamford, Connecticut
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Bottega Louie on a busy Saturday afternoon. We had a great time. The menu has something for everyone - we couldn't decide so we split a few items. The drinks are great, food great (BLT and Pizza were highlights), service (while they were very busy) was not rushed. Definitely will go again.~CathyRickAdventure~Dallas, Texas
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were told about a restaurant that we simply must try in downtown L.A.   It is called Bottega Louie and is located at 700 West Grand Ave., parking is easily found right across the street.  Bottega is a simply wonderful restaurant comprised of its own bakery and open kitchen in a vast dining area staffed by a multitude of black tied wait personnel.  We were cheerfully greeted and seated at an ample table, where we enjoyed some of the most delicious food ever.  Our food selections included a mushroom soup, French onion soup, and one of the most wonderful pizzas ever, (the Tartufo pizza), made with mozzarella, fontina, pecorino Romano, and parmigiana cheeses, creme fraiche, black truffle pate, and soft cooked egg on a fantastic stone oven-baked crust, -- one of the best pizzas we ever tasted. ($22). BTW, the French onion soup was hands down, the best we ever tasted as well. ($12).  The dessert selection was to die for, as we selected a small raspberry cake to celebrate our niece's 2 year birthday. ($15).  Our waiter, Geoffrey Clifford, was so proficient and attentive, and the Assistant General Manager, Erwin Ehanno, was so gracious, making sure everything was perfect.  To wrap things up, Bottega Louie was a fantastic culinary experience.  We are indebted to our friend for recommending it. We will definitely be back many times!  We wholeheartedly recommend it as well. Aloha.~Vallian P~Honolulu, Hawaii
Bottega Louie~1474645~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the place, service, cuisine, everything was perfect. the fried portobello was crazy delicious and the pizza: HUGE!~Melodie S~Paris, France
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~After the closure of our favourite NYC restaurant, Collichio's we were trying to find a replacement.   Bouley was highly rated but our experience was disappointing.  The food and service was OK, the starter good... but it was not great.   My wife is now GF and they didnt really cater well, brought her bread after 2mins earlier being told she was Gluten intolerant.   Just not good .... Very surprised to see it rated #2 in NYC!~Clive R~Pangbourne, United Kingdom
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Bouley is a special restaurant. Romantic. Superb personalized service. Food is good. We had both 3 course and 6 course menus Very expensive, around 600$ for 2, but worth it.  Negative: wine pairing is with very young wines. I would have prefered to ve charged more for better wines.  Will return.~annayblacky~puerto rico
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Fabulous food, beautiful atmosphere, top notch service.  An experience not to be missed. My favorite lunch in New York City ~QUEENM2~Northfield, Illinois
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~From the moment we arrived to the time we left the restaurant, everything just flowed smoothly.  The smell of apples greets you as you enter the door.  The whole wall has shelvings decorated with fresh apples.  The place is nicely and elegantly decorated. This French Restaurant has a wonderful ambience, romantic and has a nice warm feel to it.   We had the lunch tasting menu and the food was absolutely delicious, nicely presented and was perfectly paced. They have good selection of wines and great mixed ddrinks. The breads are great, a gentleman pushing a cart comes to your table several times and you get to choose the bread of your choice.   The staff are friendly and courteous.   Our server was very knowledgeable and provided us with great service.  On our way out of the restaurant we were given a nice gift bag with a pound cake in it, it was a nice touch and a lovely way to end our dining experience.  Pricey but worth it.  Nanette & Stuart D. Fountain Hills, AZ~racoonian~Fountain Hill, Arizona
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Had been there in May for a truly memorable lunch. One of my best ever. Wish I had skipped it this visit. Food not as good, service stiff and not at all friendly. Not as many "chefs surprise" courses.  No more lemon cake to go. They should close now instead of next year. So depressing.~karen c~Newport, Oregon
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Had lunch [amazing value] with family and my 16 month old son here. Staff were accommodating, food was some of the best I had tasted and the wine pairings were all really very good. Definitely would recommend who is into their food.~TMFAustralia~AUSTRALIA
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I loved every bite.  Everything that was served was absolutely delicious for not only the pallet for for the eyes.  I can't say anything wrong~Stephluvstotravel~St. Petersburg, Florida
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I loved every minute of our dinner, from the apple aroma when we entered the restaurant to the gifted loaf of bread when we left. Our food was amazing (I especially loved the Forager's mushrooms appetizer), and lots of surprise extras throughout kept us delighted. Service was wonderful (especially the server who reminded us of a French PeeWee Herman and was buoyantly happy throughout the evening).~carolriverdalian~Bronx, New York
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Just not up to par with Le Bernadin or Per Se but worth going to. The food creativity is not as inventive as Alinea or Noma, but very flavorful and cooked to perfection.~Willard F~Redwood City
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~My husband I had another excellent evening at Bouley.  Yesterday was our anniversary and my husband surprised me with dinner at Bouley.  From start to finish, every morsel was a delight to the senses.  We just marveled at how delicious every bite was.  The restaurant setting is so romantic.  The service is flawless.  Bouley is a place to go for a truly superior experience.  Wonderful restaurant to have the highest quality of every ingredient prepared in unique ways, beautifully presented with impeccable service.~Deb100000~West Orange, New Jersey
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~My wife and I were returning from a European vacation; we decided to do the layover in NYC enroute to our home in Alaska.  I made reservations a month in advance and knew it would be a great surprise.  The entire evening was wonderful, the service impeccable and the food, oh my goodness.  Every morsel would simply melt like warm butter leaving a generous portion of satisfaction in every bite.  From course to course it was of course, all very yummy.  A great dining experience.~jdharkey~Palmer, Alaska
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~One of the best in NYC and perhaps earth. Exceptional on every level. The freshest ingredients. The best service and decor. Gorgeously decorated . It will transport you to France immediately. Lunch @ $59. is unbelievable. You will want to kidnap the bread server, the bread is so good! Dine upstairs but do not face a wall as you will want to soak the ambience in. Creative dishes with  Malibu sea urchin, Hawaiian hirama, fallow deer, abound. Starched table clothes, high end wine glasses, gorgeous flower arrangements. Our favorite restaurant. Alas, it is closing in January so GET OVER THERE!!!~lfbmonkey~fort lee , new jersey
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~The five course lunch at Bouley, priced at 59 bucks, is a steal of a deal at fine dining. The main courses were traditional and soothed the taste buds, desserts were more eclectic. Plenty of amuse-bouche and extra desserts made it into a nearly 10 course luxurious lunch.~UDCAKC~Santa Cruz, California
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Very pretty dinning room in Tribeca with great food and proper service, we are glad to have tried before they close~capriorflorence~New York City, New York
Bouley~423304~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~When you walk in the small sitting area which reminds me of a house, you feel welcome and then seated in quaint table for 2 for my husband and me.The service was fabulous!  The service was a WOW!  Service started with the wine and a bread table of 8 different breads all homemade and included two gluten free breads as well.  The food stood out as one of the top dinners ever!  The sommelier led us to the perfect French Barola wine that was delectable!  We chose to participate in the price fixe and in between each one of the 3 ordered items was a chef palate cleanser or a chef taster which was lobster.  The duck was divine and the veal was tender and perfectly prepared.  At the end of the dinner, the chef had at least 8 different dessert candies for a finale.  When leaving, we were given a white handled bag with a small french loaf cake. Oh what a night!!  Spectacular 5 Star evening!~ig0ug0~Birmingham, Alabama
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Authentic Italian bakery with incredible selection. This is where the locals in the know go. Kim had a florentine cannelloni (gluten free) and Paul had a turnover. Both were outstanding!  ~Paul and Kim A~Toronto
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Bova's has been a family owned bakery in this location since 1932. There are other bakeries in the area that get more press, but this one is the genuine article. They carry an enormous selection of cookies and pastries,as well as breads and slices of pizza. They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It's a great place for after hours eating when restaurants are closed, and the people watching on weekends can be fun during the late night surge. My personal favourite is their long cinnamon twist pastries- so flaky and really good with a cup of coffee.~jgabrieleg~Boston, Massachusetts
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic local bakery. Excellent food and decent service. The prices are good. We had canolis and then went back to grab calzones and cookies for later. A must eat. ~JW81812~Bend, Oregon
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great breads and pastries....... Worth a stop while you are in the North End. They also have sandwiches. ~Mamye K~Boston, Massachusetts
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great selection - every Italian dessert you can think of - plus pizza, calzones, chowder, etc -- and open 24 hours a day!!~BostonArtie~Boston, Massachusetts
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was not disappointed with my visit to Bova's. They have a huge selection of Italian Pastries and breads. They are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.  ~MISCMOMOF3~Murrells Inlet, South Carolina
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Most people who visit the North End in Boston go to Mike's for baked goods. But Bova's is hidden away and worth the slightly longer walk. There is no fancy decor. It's a working bakery with excellent baked goods. You can't go wrong here. Try the pistachio cookies, for instance. They are to die for.~TheScribe_10~Boston
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One Mini Lobster Tail and two tiny sugar cookies for $6?! How??? And the pastry was completely hard and stale-tasting. The cream inside was all dried out - gross dot com.~expat_mbk~USA
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is soooooo much better than any of the other bakeries near by.  Their cannoli is the best!  I was so glad we ran across this bakery before going to the "popular" bakery.  It was busy but they are efficient and the line goes quickly.~Tammy K~Ackley, Iowa
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place will overwhelm you with its selection of sugary delicacies.  It's absurd.  I can say it's the best black and white cookie I've ever had, for starters.  The cannoli are good, and the chocolate cake I got was also fantastic.  I'm not sure you can go wrong if you have a sweet tooth.~Adam T~Baltimore, Maryland
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walked by on our way to dinner in the North End and made sure to save room for dessert.  Went about 10 PM and enjoyed a cannoli, but could not make up my mind.  So many beautiful desserts.  The calzones and pizza looked delicious as well.  Just going in the store was fun.~Binnidm~Kenosha, Wisconsin
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We actually found Bova's using TripAdvisor. What a find! Best cannoli I have ever had. The flaky pastry dough was so good. We also had a lemon tart and a vanilla cupcake. The people working here were so friendly. Highly recommended if you are in the area.~dbae27~Staunton, Virginia
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We checked out Bova for the first time two years ago and were not disappointed.  The cannolis are delicious.  The cases are a bit haphazard so take some time to check out before ordering.~SueMay28~Shrewsbury, Massachusetts
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We definitely lucked out with this place!  Just decided to pop in and check it out and the selection was incredible.  The cannoli's were amazing and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  We certainly felt like we had experienced a Boston moment.~Tracy T~Ottawa, Canada
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went in for a couple of cannolis and left with 6 cannolis, 2 lobster tails, and a dozen cookies. Yum!  Our taste buds were very happy our whole time in Boston! What I wouldn't give for more of those pistachio cookies that just melt in your mouth!~Laurena W~Springfield, Oregon
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were looking for something to take to our apartment and have for breakfast the next morning. Some of the other pastry shops had lots of desserts but nothing for breakfast. Bova's had both! And was very good. Not on the beaten path like some but very well located and easy to find. The people who work there are very friendly and give you plenty of time to decide!~EdwardsOklahomaCity~Oklahoma City
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow! Wow! Wow! Just a couple blocks from the "famous" bakeries with the big long lines, is this little gem of a bakery/market. The place is jammed with Italian cookies, Cannoli's, tempting pastries, and even some traditional sandwiches and calzones for a quick bite for lunch. We stopped in right after lunch. But I could not leave without a couple pounds of assorted yummy cookies to take home. Skip the lines!~X-countryGuy~Coventry, Connecticut
Bova's Bakery~831598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You must eat cannoli at this place. It's absolutely amazing. I had a regular one the first time and a pumpkin one this time ('tis the season and such). Both were incredible. Next time, I'm just going to plan to eat all the food I eat in North End at Bova's. The sandwiches and calzones looked amazing and I lamented being already full.~Steve L~Boston, Massachusetts
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Absolutely the ideal breakfast spot. The menu appears to be small but provides dozens of flavor choices. Fast, friendly service staff makes eating breakfast a quick in and out. O'Brien potatoes are fabulous with any meal.  And the portions are definitely oversized. Fresh fruit served as a side with almost every meal is a great completion to your breakfast.~OrmondBeachFL~Florida
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After an early morning landing at Sky Harbor, we decided the first thing we needed to do was find a great place to have breakfast.  So, I did what I always do and consult with fellow TripAdvisor reviewers and as almost always, we found a great place in the Breakfast Club.  Between the 4 of us we couldn't find a single thing not to like, the food and service was excellent, good sized menu and we got to sit outside in the beautiful Phoenix weather.  I had the 4 egg breakfast, (hard to find a 4 egg option),  potatoes o'brien, toast & fresh fruit. Others at the table had the Biscuits & Gravy, Jalapeno cheddar biscuit topped with 2 eggs, fontina cheese with sausage gravy and with potatoes o'brien and fresh fruit.  Service was very good, juice surely tasted fresh squeezed and the coffee was fresh & hot.  When I travel back to Phoenix I will be sure to go back to Breakfast Club.~Joseph T~Indianapolis, Indiana
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Before heading to 1pm D'backs baseball game, we went here for brunch.  Cool spot! Good food, prices are reasonable and service attentive.  Fast, casual and surprisingly little wait when we went.  Definitely be back.  ~Karen A~Phoenix, Arizona
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great breakfast entrees in a busy fast paced atmosphere.  You can't go wrong here, the quality of the food and its presentation was superb.  ~snowclimber~Flagstaff
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and great service! A gem in downtown Phoenix! Get there early. Very crowded and once you eat there you'll know why!~RenoRoadWarriors~Reno, NV
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great outdoor area to sit and have breakfast. Quick service and good food.  Had an egg white chicken and avocado omelette. It was excellent. Tianna was server and did great job. ~dac831~Chicago
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a great breakfast here with also great service. Our w server was patient as we perused the extensive menu. My wife finally settled on a egg white omelet with spinach that was tremendous. I had the french toast which was awesome. Portions are large so you won't leave hungry.~SmokiesJunkie~Fishers, Indiana
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had breakfast here on a recent visit to Chase Field. Food was decent and portion size large.  Service was good and we were in and out in good time. ~Sean F~Brandon, Canada
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been here twice. Had the Continental breakfast that is juice, fruit, toast, and coffee. Staff is very good and effective. Some are college student's. Recommend you drop in their full breakfast looks good too. I'll definitely be back.~Robert W~Bedford, Texas
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a great place for breakfast when staying at the Palomar Hotel. You can access it from the second floor if you're staying in the hotel. Otherwise, you'll need to use the stairs or escalator to get to it from the street level. It's located in a very nicely landscaped CityScape plaza with indoor and outdoor dining options. They even have a separate coffee/juice bar in front of the restaurant for those who want to grab something to go (including pastries). It's just a great atmosphere. The service was also wonderful. We had breakfast here twice during our weekend stay in Phoenix.   So, I'll give you the good with the bad (mostly good). I loved the BC Iced Coffee. It's their signature coffee that has a subtle flavor of caramel & hazelnut. What a great way to start the day! I was also happy with the Traditional Bene. The eggs were a little overdone for poached eggs, but it was still very good. It was served with a thick slice of ham and topped with a hollandaise sauce that was very creamy. It was unlike other sauces of that type that I've had before (which have more lemon). This had more of a cheesy taste to it. It was very good. I also like the fruit skewers (slices of watermelon, pineapple, melon, and cantaloupe). So much so, that I had 2 sides of fruit instead of the fried potatoes. It was perfect. On the second day, I had the Banana's Foster pancake. These are large pancakes. I could barely eat the one pancake that I ordered. The pancake was good, but I didn't care for the Banana's Foster topping. It was too much like caramel. I recommend that you get another flavor unless you really like eating sticky caramel on pancakes.   My husband had the Border Bowl the first day, and the Chicken Fried Chicken on the second day. He really liked the chicken the best. He liked the flavor of the Border Bowl, but he said it was too watery. Maybe because it was packed with chopped peppers and other veggies.  Overall, we were very happy with this restaurant. It was very convenient, and the service was very good. We'd eat there again if ever in the Phoenix area. Highly recommended it if you're staying at a hotel nearby.~KarenV87~Tampa, Florida
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a busy spot and I can see why. The food is great and it has a lively atmosphere. Menu has something for everyone from traditional bacon and eggs, omelettes or eggs Bennie. The bloody Mary's are a great kickstart to the morning. Prices are very decent. Service wasn't great the first time but we went back because the food was good and it was quick.  The second time the service was much better. ~kik2~Calgary, Canada
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great place to have a great breakfast. Came in on a weekday and it was busy. Only had to wait 5 minutes for a table for 4. The service was fast and great. The server gave us suggestions and was always on the ball with filling up the water and coffees. The signature french toast was to die for and the coffee was great. Very easy to get to and only a couple of blocks from our hotel. ~crash2224~Calgary, Canada
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Those bennies with portobello mushrooms are excellent!  The secret is eggs cooked to perfection and a delicious sauce. It tasted lighter than a traditional bechamel. On first impression, the place is big, airy. Very bright, in contrast with other restaurants around town that avoid natural light. The owner was around (always a good sign), service was quick. Reasonably priced. Would love to return with friends on a weekend. ~demandingBelgium~Belgium
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Traveled to Phoenix on business and had breakfast here three times during my five night stay.  The food is excellent and the staff is very friendly/helpful.  The Breakfast Club is a great alternative to your standard hotel breakfast fare!~photodigichick~Charlotte, North Carolina, United States
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was looking for an outdoor venue for breakfast and happened upon The Breakfast Club.  All I can say is that it was an overall wonderful experience.  The food was delicious, there wasn't one thing that we had that wasn't perfect.  We had a WONDERFUL waitress who went above and beyond which ALWAYS makes the experience better. Make this a "MUST DO" if you are in Phoenix...and get the BC Signature French. :)~VOKane~Arlington, Massachusetts
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We didn't discover this place until our last morning in Phoenix and we loved it. We would have eaten here every morning if we had known about it. It's adjacent to the Palomar Hotel where we stayed so it was so convenient. Great patio with lots of shade. Our server was very sweet and our food was very prompt in being served. We ordered blueberry waffles and the breakfast sandwich. Both items were excellent. The mimosa are made from fresh squeezed OJ and were delicious. Loved this little discovery!~Joanna W~Tulsa
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had breakfast in here, had 2x breakfasts and 2x coffees and an OJ.  Then as we were about to leave - the waitress brought out 2x takeaway coffees. top notch~Catherine M~Bristol
Breakfast Club~3320960~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went there with a friend for some Bennys and a Bloody Mary.  Great service overall.  If you don't mind sitting at the counter and share a table with strangers, we got seated right away.  Some were waiting for over 40 minutes for their tables.    Tried the Mignon and Salmon Benny which were both excellent.  Fast service, great food and good prices.~hom409~Cold Lake, Canada
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~ Great deli options! Food is fresh and excellent. Loved the tuna and avocado salad. Nice wait staff and ambiance.~Anne G~Castle Rock, Colorado, United States
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After moving to another state and growing up with Brent's delicatessen, other delis just don't compare in my opinion. The corn beef is amazing and the matzah ball soup is fantastic. I'm also a sucker for their bakery and black and white cookies......oh ya!~Jon N~Los Angeles, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Brent's is an institution!  I have never had a bad meal here.  The portions are huge and the quality is amazing!  Friendly, fast service.  This is one of my staples!~Ronnie C~Los Angeles, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Family restaurant.  Excellent service with plenty of staff.  Portions ample and delicious. If you make sure you arrive early, you will not be on the waiting line.  Popular retaurant.~patdlng~Granada Hills, CA
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great atmosphere, always full of people, great portions. Fast pleasant service. Clean and easy ordering~Misswello~Los Angeles, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had dinner here a few weeks ago and wish that it was possible to go back every day.  Very good food and lots of it on the plate.~TheGreatBarusky~Captain Cook, Hawaii
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten at Brent's in Northridge at least 200  times over the past 21 years, and my family has tried many items on the huge menu including stuffed cabbage, soups, sandwiches, salads.  We have enjoyed consistently great service, generous portions, as well as food that tastes almost like grandma would make. Love the warm rye bread, pickles and pickled tomatoes.  Bursting with cheese, the blintzes rate among the best I have ever eaten, not too sweet. I also enjoy the Monte Cristo sandwich.~livinginla2016~Los Angeles, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm alway impressed with the quality and selection.   I always bring stuff home  can never finish their generous amounts~Worthie M~Sherman Oaks
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Never disappointed with Brent's. Selection outstanding. Best deli in San Fernando Valley, maybe all of So. Cal!~dryflyrob62~Kila, Montana
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of my favorite spots for breakfast OR lunch.  You may need to wait a bit for at table............but worth every second.  Put this place on your Bucket List for a REAL Deli.~Dkatiegirl~Los Angeles, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for breakfast last Sunday with my bride, we both ordered pancakes and a side meat. I also ordered a tomato juice. The tomato juice had a strange metallic taste, I returned it and was given credit for same. The pancakes were under-cooked and  had a strange texture. This is not a cheap place, but quite expensive ($31,00 for two of us) I have been going to Brent's for years but I think the children or grandchildren of the original owners have taken over and are no longer paying attention to the business. I doubt that in the future I will risk my money to see if they remain good in the deli side of the business.~T H~San Fernando
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The servers were good and helpful. I had the Black Reuben because of the raves. It was good as delis go, but not exceptional. Machine sliced pastrami had little personality and poor mouthfeel. Is it so hard to have thicker slices? The huge fries had no crisp, little flavor, and weren't salted. They were very hot yet salt didn't stick to them. As a place to go to often, it's fine. But it's not a "destination" restaurant. Fortunately it was on my way home.~Jason V~San Diego, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came in with a infant and would have kept him in the stroller which we were forced to move because it was "in the way". I tried to put it in our booth but there wasn't enough room for it to lay straight and flat on the seat. There was nowhere else to put my baby and the girl said she would help us get another booth with more room. She never came back.~Ango4~Los Angeles, California
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~best deli in los angeles by a mile. been going there for over 40 years and never once disappointed. its a definante yes~Arlene7729~Northridge
Brent's Delicatessen & Restaurant~348825~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we have been eating at Brent's deli for years and everything on the menu is really good. The atmosphere is very loud the booths are old and it is very very crowded. Service is okay prices are high by everybody seems to love it. The menu is huge.there is truly something for everybody.~melodiel534~Woodland Hills
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a big fan of craft beer, I was excited to finally get to Brown's.  The food was disappointing, but the beer was good. The Riveter IPA was the best part of the experience; a nice hoppy kick and a citrusy blend.  The service wasn't awful, but not great; the server only messed up one of our orders.  The food runner who brought it out was sure to correct us though... It wasn't the kitchens fault, the server put it in wrong, so I guess that makes it our fault.  No accommodation; we just had to pick the olives off the nachos.  I had bland mac and cheese with luke-warm pulled pork on top, which I guess is one of their signature items.  There are better options in the area for pub food and craft beer.~Randy H~Johnstown, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner with friends before attending a ballgame required dealing with a timetable, but hoping for a chance for relaxed conversation. Our choice had to be local, with a reputation for reliability - as opposed to a chain . The Taproom was all of that! We ate upstairs overlooking the bar. It is a very spacious restaurant separated from the river by a parking lot. It was just too hot this day to dine on the terrace. Everybody enjoyed their meals and the service - food and beverage  - was spot on. A very pleasant, well informed waitress took the order and the rest of the meal was service by committee. One party member's gluten free needs were appropriately addressed and we were always well looked after.~upthehudson~Kingston, NY
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great beer paired with an ever-changing food menu. They even employ a real chef! If you like craft beer and a great atmosphere Brown's is the place.~rs_joe~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had lunch here with the family, after picking up our student at RPI.  Great service; great beer; good quality food; relaxed atmosphere - great to sit outside on a sunny day.~Michele D~Fair Lawn, New Jersey
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I consider myself a regular there. Once you go, you will want to come back. Excellent menu selections, delicious beer, and friendly service make Browns a must visit in Troy, NY. If you have plans for going somewhere else after, cancel because you will want to stay!!~Kerryman11~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located on the Hudson River, Brown's appeals to everyone. Inside and Outside dining. Good for small group get togethers, families, and bringing your significant other. Enjoy some Great Food and Beer. This is a Brew Pub, with their beers being distributed locally. For the more adventurous take in a local band at Revolution Hall, right next door. You will return though, because the Beer, Food, and Staff, will beckon your your tastebuds back.~Mitchell P~Philmont, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our son got married here the last Friday in October. What a great place. The service was incredible and the food very delicious. They really can handle a big crowd as there were about 130 people. There  also was plenty of room for the band and everyone up and dancing.~Linda S~Thousand Oaks, California
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for an after graduation lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Naturally the beer selection was endless. They have a large menu with some daily specials. Mallory our waitress was very attentive to our needs. Large burgers (The Uncle Sam Burger) and Quesadillas were very tasty. Reasonable prices too.~Philroy2014~Amsterdam, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is decent, but the service is slow. I have had instances where I had to leave because my lunch took so long to come, and I had to return to work.~joesatthev~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This brew pub has a great selection of beer that's made on premises and has creative, fresh pub food at affordable prices. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere with outdoor seating on the bank of the Hudson River. You can sample the many types of beer at no cost, and, they offer two sizes of growlers (larger size is 64 oz.) to take beer with you.~Ron R~Connecticut
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is our go to place when we want good solid food..it never fails..our waitress was very friendly & accommodating!  Food was very good..when home with leftovers..~anna10302016~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We waited 40 minutes for our appetizer to be brought to the table.  I flagged down the server Christine, she didn't come over to the table to see what I needed.  She must have assumed.  I am actually typing this review at the table.  We watched other patrons arrive, eat and then leave before our appetizer even showed.  Not sure how much longer our server would have had us wait if we didn't flag her down.  She did not come back to see how our meal was.  By the time my meal was completed she then came over to see if I wanted a refill.  Food was very good.  I would have expected a little faster service for 2:30pm on a Saturday.  We are the only patrons left on the second floor and our credit card is still awaiting pick up by our server who is no where to be seen.  Came here as it rated #3 in Troy.  Would have gone elsewhere.  The food can be amazing but at what cost are you willing to wait?  Still waiting to pay and leave.  Another server just offered to take it up for us.  Unacceptable.~SherryBerry76~Barrington, NH
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Brown's, a group of six, on a Tuesday night, on our way to a concert. Folks looking for sandwiches, a couple of beers and a nice setting to catch up in. Brown's scored in all three areas.  The beer is, of course, their own, expertly crafted, great flavors and variety. The Oatmeal Stout is always a winner in my book, although their fall Oktoberfest and pumpkin beers were available, I didn't not have time to sample.  I guess I'll just have to go back.  The service was great.  Our server was pleasant, knowledgable and efficient. The food was served promptly and was excellent.  My Uncle Sam burger was rare as requested, and onion rings crispy. The final bill surprised us all.  Very reasonably priced. Good job-High marks.~jelmwood~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for a bite to eat and have some drinks with a friend. Love dining alfresco and overlooking the Hudson River. The service was great and the food was delicious. The portions were very large. I will be back to this restaurant and highly recommend it.~maijr1119~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While our waitress was lovely, the food was just awful!  I ordered a tuna salad over greens, dressing on the side.  The greens were soaking wet, & I'd say at least half of them were slimy & uneatable!  My husband's salad too, the Cobb, while not quite as slimy as mine, was also disgusting.  How could the kitchen send these out??~jf2189~Albany, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With a party of 20 we were extremely pleased with the time and attention given to each of us. Food was served timely, hot and very tasty! Wouldn't hesitate to return in the future and would recommend it to others as well. Enjoyed the evenings entertainment as well.~Bob P~Troy, New York
Brown's Brewing Company~1153096~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~only downside is can be noisy. I likely get the sampler of 4-5 4oz glasses of their different beers and ales~george r~Troy, New York
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Brownstone has really delicious pancakes. I usually order the Pecan pancakes with the corned beef hash and eggs. I'm never disappointed. They now offer gluten free pancakes as well! I'm gluten sensitive and I'm so excited that they finally have this option. It's very good. Dinner is OK. I prefer coming here for breakfast.~BahamaMama3~Montclair, NJ
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't go here on a whim you need to be hungry there is more than ample food we had a starter and a main and really struggled a piece of cheese cake between two.~johnjoewood~Workington Cumbria
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place to eat. Wonderful selection and generous portions. Husband had Thanksgiving Dinner and couldn't finish it. Prices were great.~LYNN C~LA VERGNE, TN
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I first heard of this diner on the food network show with Guy Fieri. It's definitely a great place to go for pancakes. Lines are long on the weekend but the food is good and once you're seated, its not long before you are eating!!~Kia H~Jersey City
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like this place, the food is just okay aside from breakfast, a little salty. Lackluster staff. Expansive menu, well-lit. Seems like a lot of first dates go here or this is sort of the go-to after Zeppelin hall beer garden. The reason I gave it three stars is because it is expensive, crowded and a bit trendy. It is not a real "greasy spoon" NJ diner. Go to the Coach House.~Andrew E~Whitehouse Station
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went with my friends here because we always leave in a food coma. I tried the Country Pancake Wrap which was delicious. It's like a burrito just with your breakfast favorites. I gave it 4 out of 5 because the waitress didn't provide good service. Still left her the standard 15% tip nonetheless. ~castilloo2~Secaucus, New Jersey
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been here several times with family and friends.  Every time the food is just ok. The food does come out, most times, hot and fast. But is under-seasoned and I mean just basic salt and pepper.  My husband was in the hospital and the diner happens to be right across the street.  Went in and got ONE order of cheese steak and fries. The cheese steak was hot but tasteless and the fries were greasy.  I threw more than half of it away and it cost me $16! I was there most recently in August for breakfast (only because of a friend) and the syrup tasted weird. So our waitress (after we tracked her down) brought another container.  Still didn't taste quite right to both of us.  So we asked for the packages you get in when you order food to-go.  She had to ask the owner and he said no because we were dining in!?  He changed his mind and had the waitress tell us we could each only have one . . .? Don't think I'll be back even if someone invites AND pays the tab.~bebxs3~Bayonne, NJ
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are looking for breakfast, I am not sure that there is anyplace else to go.  The menu is HUGE with options for everyone.  The pancakes, as you would guess, are fantastic.  However, the sausage, hash and omelette's were all great too.  This is a do not miss breakfast place in Jersey City!~mahays15~Cleveland, Ohio
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Quick, efficient service. Food comes out hot and is standard fare. Pancakes have good flavor. Unless you are really, really hungry, order a short stack - the regular stack is hard to finish.  Poached eggs are perfectly cooked in water - runny yolks and firm whites.  The spinach benedict has three eggs and a mixture of spinach with feta instead of the ham. It was tasty. Hollandaise is from a mix but it was better than expected - tart and not too greasy.  Grits were cooked in water so they are mostly tasteless. They put a dollop of butter on top but they needed a lot of salt and would be better of cooked in milk.  The menu si enormous. Omelettes look like they would be very good and large. Booths have confortable cushions and the tables and floors were clean.~ouilv2travel~Chicago, IL
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This casual, family-friendly diner is a go-to for my family on most weekends and a place I often bring friends when they visit. The food is good, the coffee is hot and the staff is friendly. A must-try are the pancakes - just like my grandma used to make! Very kid-friendly, it's also a good place for business breakfasts, if you're in the area.  I highly recommend!~MonicaKF~New York City
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We took 7 people to eat, we were greeted at the door and seated at a table. Our waiter took our drink order and brought drinks right back to us. We placed our order and the food was delivered in less then 10 minutes. Hot, fresh and delicious! We had pancakes, chicken basket, double hamburger platter, the Greek platter and breakfast. All were very good and plenty of food. We would definitely go there again when here.  Hope you try them if you are in the area.~setzler50~Orleans, Massachusetts
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We travel to Jersey City once a year and make it a point to go to the Brownstone for fun family fair. Staff is awesome and the food is always great. ~MedfordMA~Medford, Massachusetts
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went here to try to get a great breakfast closer to the river when first arriving in New Jersey.    This had THE best breakfast I've had in a long time.  The sausage is what I still think about two months after my visit here.  It was obviously fresh and homemade.  The rest of the breakfast was perfection.   This also was where we first got a glimpse of how close New York was to NJ.  What a great place!  Worth fighting traffic to get to.~Jolie D~Westminster
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were celebrating our son's birthday and stayed in Jersey City overnight.  We went to this diner because of the reviews. My husband wasn't very hungry but ended up trying their specialty which was the pancake wrap. It was huge! I had their western omelet. Needless to say we left we containers for both of us! Service was great, food delicious and value was great! By the time we left, there were numerous people waiting to experience this great place! Should I say more?~Cheryl C~Seaville, New Jersey, United States
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying in Jersey City and found this place to try, we first went for breakfast and the pancakes were fantastic, there is no way you could finish them, but they were light and fluffy.  We were so pleased we went back for dinner, again we were very impressed with the quantity and quality of food we were served for the price.  The cocktails are also very reasonably priced and contain a lot of alcohol, they were delicious.  If you are staying in the area you should definitely check it out early in your stay so you can go again. ~Howletts~Perth, Australia
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying near here and because it's rated #2 in the area we thought we'd check it out. I'd read the reviews and was excited for my first breakfast in Jersey City.  Unfortunately the meal was distinctly average - I went for the French Toast combo with Eggs, Bacon and Sausage, all of which were luke warm.  My son was very excited by the Nutella stack of pancakes. We warned him that he wouldn't be able to eat them all as it was an adult portion but he was determined.  Unsurprisingly he didn't finish so I jumped in.  Again disappointment ensued.  The pancakes were very stodgy.  Then we were faced with a the bill - over $50 for 3 adult breakfasts and one kids pancake!  I know the exchange rate is bad but we thought this was very high in comparison to previous visits to the US.~nogrille~Surrey, Hants, Berks borders
Brownstone Diner & Pancake~935413~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Without question the best diner in Jersey City! Anything I've order always come out well made. For diner food they are the best. Large servings, friendly staff, great owner. Normal casual northeast diner atmosphere, and they are clean. When your hungry come here. ~D G~Jersey City, New Jersey
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fabulous place for dinner with delicious and unique food.  I dream of the edamame dumplings.  Great drinks too.~SueChef76~Newton, Massachusetts
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First I visited during restaurant week. I ordered the sashimi and sea bass. The sashimi was ok but not outstanding. The sea bass was average. The server dropped off an extremely hot plate and did not warn me.  Hence I suspect it had been microwaved before service to the table which accounted for the dryness of the fish. ~DM T~Chicago, Illinois
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I dine at Buddakan several times a year and it is one of the most beautifully designed asian restaurants you'll ever experience.  Long established in Olde City Philadelphia, in the historic area, they now have other Buddakan's in New York City and elsewhere all owned by Steven Starr, who owns about 25 excellent restaurants in Philadelphia.  The room is dominated by a giant Buddah statue and there is a large communal dining table but also plenty of individual tables~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Make reservations, come hungry and be prepared, $$$$. The restaurant is a little noisy and room is kind of dark, nicely decorated. Great for a romantic dinner. Entrees are in the mid $20 range. Restaurant week menu is $35 pp for appetizer, entree and desert. Had the dumplings to start, cashew chicken and cheesecake. All was well prepared. My daughter had same appetizer and large shrimp (5). My wife had the pork, same appetizer and dipped donuts. My daughter's boyfriend had dumplings and cashew chicken. I don't recall his desert selection. The entrees came with two large bowls of white rice.  My daughter ordered a mashed potato side for $12, for the table. We also enjoyed the fruit Sangria $44 for a pitcher. A coke and 1 non-alcoholic drink brought the pre tip bill to around $220, for four.~DoylestownTraveler~Doylestown,PA
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice Asian fusion restaurant, friendly staffs  and very good service. We had aged beef, sea bass, chow fun cooked to perfection. We will definitely go back.~phillywang33~Mount Laurel, New Jersey
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice atmosphere. Food was good. Ordered the calamari salad which was very good. Also had the pepper beef steak which was more salty than peppery - it also had huge chucks of extremely hard croutons soaked in the sauce from the steak that were not good.~taaskew~Huntsville, Alabama
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Planted in the heart of Philly, great spot for food and drinks! My husband and I went here for dinner and loved the atmosphere and food.  Great sampler appetizer and the sea bass was amazing! We went on a Thursday night around 6pm and it wasn't crowded at all.  Staff was very knowledgeable on the menu and offer great suggestions! ~MommaDukes13~Baltimore, Maryland
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really loved this restaurant.  Beautiful design and atmosphere.  Waterfall and large Bhudda set the tone.  Wonderful original cocktails.  Everything we ordered was so good.  Service impeccable.  Servers know there business.  All things considered, I had to give it a five, for both atmosphere and food.~BuckeyePaulD~Howard, Ohio
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The upscale trendy atmosphere of Budakan immediately transports you when you walk through the doors but it is the food that really delivers.  I came with a group of 8 for dinner and 6 of us ordered their tasting menu. This is really not an accurate description for it because the food just kept coming.  It was an incredible feast that I would drive back to Philadelphia to experience again any day.~Keflewis~Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is my 3rd visit to this particular restaurant. The service was the best from all restaurants we have ever visited. Mark, our waiter, was absolutely excellent - always there at the right moment, but completely unobtrusive.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu and additionally we got the aged beef which is my favorite and excellent. I highly recommend it. The himachi sashimi and the chicken dumplings were amazing. The Chilean sea bass was not to my taste exactly - it was very well prepared, I just didn't love the sauce. The beef chow fun was excellent. We also tried the 3 deserts - donuts, cheesecake, and chocolate dome. They were all good, but the donuts were the best.~shuytza~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We recently had the chance to try the Buddakan in Philadelphia the first in the family of Buddakan (we had only been to the one in New York previous to this visit). The menu is  somewhat similar to the one in NYC but with differences to match the chef's style. We enjoyed the place, although it was far from where we were staying, but the food was not as spectacular and grand as their other restaurant in New York, so in comparison it was a bit disappointing. That being said, we had a lovely dinner. Two dishes were awesome and are defenetely worth trying: the pork belly bao buns and the miso black cod. We also enjoyed their chocolate palet. I highly recommend to make a reservation in advance.~Annick831~Ventura, California
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were surprised at the size of the portions considering you are getting 3 items for lunch.  They were on the generous side.  Highly recommend any of the dumplings and soups.  Also the spring rolls with the mustard sauce were the best!  Spare ribs good, but cashew chicken was better choice.  Will go again for sure.  Service was attentive and timely.~shirley0415~Rehoboth Beach
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With the restaurant open late, we decided to have dinner after the theater.   OpenTable or phone reservations are not taken after 10.  We arrived at 11, and the ditsy hostess told us that there would be a ten minute wait.  Fifteen minutes later, we were seated, although there had been several empty tables in the interval.  The martini was short.  While the shrimp dumpling and the chicken dish were fine, the lobster fried rice was almost devoid of any crustacean.  Curiously, even at this late hour and without a full house, the place is still noisy.~larryderm~Narberth, Pennsylvania
Buddakan~433470~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow! This has to be one of the best meal experiences ever. If you have 5 or more people you have to get the tasting meal! Unbelievable meal!  Can't say enough about this restaurant. The food, wait staff, and ambiance is amazing. ~3Duffields~Madison Heights, Virginia
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Busboys and Poets serves some of the best and most innovative food at reasonable prices in the DC area. Whether you are a meat eater, a vegetarian or vegan, there are great choices for everyone. I'm vegan but I go here with all of my meat eating friends. Often they wind up trying vegan dishes. My personal favorites are the Vegan Cobb Salad, the Vegan Sliders and the Vegan "Tuna" Salad Sandwich. I have NEVER taken a new person to Busboys who didn't love it. Never.  But Busboys is so much more than just a restaurant. This location has an excellent bookstore. It is an event venue, a place to share views and opinions. There are sofas and low tables for people to gather and talk or work. They welcome folks who just want to hang out and read or work on their computers. There are author events, events promoting social justice.  I live in Arlington, VA so I mostly frequent that location since it's only a couple of miles from my house. However the 14th and V location isn't too far so I often meet my DC friends there.~gaylefleming~arlington, VA
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyed a nice brunch here on a Saturday mid-day. The vibes were nice, the food was good, and the portions were cool. Overall the bookstore and restaurant combo was nice deal. We had a group of 12 with various appetites from a vegetarian to a meat lover! Everyone enjoyed their food (sweet potato pancakes and grits with cheese were my favs). No shrimp and grits on the brunch menu was a bummer.~Whitnee B~Texas
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Horrendous service.  I was there for a book signing and presentation and was completely ignored by the wait staff.  I ended up having to go to the bar to order an app and drink.  When I said I was being ignored, I was looked at like I had three heads.  I had to pull out my own water bottle just to get a drink...which, of, course, I ended up forgetting.~Kristin H~Arlington, Virginia
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the distinct honor of being the featured poet at Busboys and Poets on October 18.  The entire room was filled with love.  The shrimp and grit appetizer was delish!  There's more to do here than eat and enjoy poetry.  There is an amazing bookstore and lounge area.  I'd highly recommend this location on any Tuesday night.  Let Droopy know that Rose sent ya!~rosie313~Warren, MI
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I walked by this place one evening and thought, "wow, that looks great! I need to come back!"  So I did.  =)  It was even better than I expected!  I loved the atmosphere, had a great waiter and my turkey sandwich was really tasty. I got a cafe medici which was Delicious but kind of tiny. Maybe that's normal for that drink.  I would definitely return.  The sandwich was really filling and around $10 so I thought it was a good value.~AKgrown_goes_to_Indo~Nikiski, Alaska
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My foodie husband found this gem. The location is located in Dupont Circle and it has this very cool, eclectic vibe. We sat on couches and ate. The restaurant also has a bookstore so you can walk around and actually look at books that you may want to purchase. Actual books, yes!! The food was amazing! I would call the food, upscale soul food. I had the chocolate layer cake for dessert and want to put my feet up on the couch and take a nap afterward. I will definitely go back there when I go back to DC!~eprichards~Richardson, Texas
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is excellent. They treat you like family. Our wait was not long. I would recommend it to vistors and people alike to go check it out. You will not regret it!!~Lisa J~Essington
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took our nephew out to have a snack. It was a beautiful day so at on the patio and had a few beers and some appetizers. They were out of the beer Iwanted but was able to find a suitable replacement. We ordered several appetizersand enjoyed the beautiful day. I got the hummas, my husband got the bean dip and our nephew got the nacho's with chicken. The food was good and both dips were fresh and delicious and the nacho' s were very large and still warm.and tasty.~finlynchmom~finleychmom
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very interesting bookstore/restaurant combo place. I apparently came in at the wrong time though, because all the items I really wanted off the menu were dinner only and I was 30-40 minutes too early for that. What I did end up ordering was still very good though.  They've got a nice selection of special cocktails there. I tried a couple of them and was not disappointed.~Ethan P~Lynchburg, Virginia, United States
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We are glad we dined at Busboys and Poets. The food great, nice atmosphere and excellent service. We went for Happy Hour and selected entrees off the main and HH menus. My husband stayed the cocktails were great. Busboys was one of the tastiest dining options during our whole trip.  We enjoyed the: excellent lamb sliders (HH 1/2 off), sweet potato hash (HH 1/2 off) , chicken nachos (good to be shared for 2), shrimp cake and Hawaiian pizza.  Our server LJ (Lashanda) was exceptional!! We will definitely dine here on any future visits.  ~TXLady10~Sugar Land, Texas
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We decided to try Busboys and Poets because there weren't many options for breakfast in the vicinity.  Boy, am I glad we did.  I wasn't impressed with the service but the food was delicious.  I decided to give the sweet potato pancakes a try and they were sooo delicious. I ordered eggs and ham and they came with fruit.  Way too much food, but I was extremely happy.  My hubby got eggs and grits.  We make grits at home all of the time but these were different somehow - creamier and delicious.  We also shared a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice - yummy!~MsRee57~Stuart, Florida
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on a recent Friday night.  The restaurant is large and interesting.  Upon entering, there is a book/gift shop with intellectual reads and postcards with area happenings.  It's a great browse while you wait for your table as this place gets very crowded.  The menu has lots of vegetarian/vegan options.  I had the free-range 1/2 chicken and it was very good. We had 4 entrees, 2 desserts and 3 drinks and our bill came to 120 USD (tip included).  I didn't see many kids in the restaurant and it gets very loud.  The crowd was mostly younger adults (20's, 30's), but that didn't stop us from having a good time.~Holmesmcjj~Connecticut
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What an amazing experience! Great atmosphere and a menu with lots of vegetarian options for my friend/co-worker! The coconut tofu bites are a must-try, even if you're not a vegetarian. Absolutely delicious. Great service and good prices. ~Natalie S~United States
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When traveling, I always look for places that boast great vegan options but still serve meat-based dishes, since I travel with family members who are not vegans. I have tried almost everything on the menu, but my favorites are the vegan chicken stir-fry and the vegan nachos. This is a great place to go whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or meat eater.~Hawks321~Jackson, Mississippi
Busboys and Poets~864330~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~a fun place to eat.  I have had the Cuban sandwich, the salad niscoise and  quinoa salad on my three visits there. the Bloody Mary was a little spicy for me, but the food items were all excellent and  the service was great.  I would recommend this restaurant any time. ~philip w~Great Neck, New York
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been many times but this visit warrants review. Obnoxious host greeting us with ridiculous pretense. Manager acknowledged the rudeness by offering to check on us throughout dinner, yet never returned. Wait staff was impeccable. Thanks for that!  All in all, last time dining here. The old guard was far superior.~Craiggers~Johannesburg, South Africa
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Felt rushed  the food was just ok. Pushed us to over order. Service was just ok. The bar service was great. The bartenders very nice. Would not go back~sharpd27~Franklinville, New Jersey
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having dined worldwide in some world class restaurants, this visit was very impressive, far above expectations.  The atmosphere is excellent, very classic.  We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table (we were early, and seated on time).  The bar is amazing.  Knowledgable talkative bartenders, who have ample knowledge of their extensive scotch selection, even offered samples.  We just had a few old fashions and he made them perfectly.  The service at the table was equally impressive.  The wine list was extensive with a broad spectrum of prices for everyone.  Being a fan of Napa Cabernets, was pleased to see several favorites on the list and well priced.  The steaks and sides, and salad appetizers were incredible, cooked perfectly, seasoned lightly but perfect.  This restaurant is certainly one of the top steakhouses I've visited.~keithnewhook~St. John's, Canada
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I normally wouldn't go to a place like this because of the price but I'm game during restaurant week.  It lets you experience fine dining places like this for a reasonable amount.  Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent here but is just a little too much to justify.  The steak was one of the best ever and was so good.~SkilledOne4~Spring City, Pennsylvania
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My boyfriend and I had a very enjoyable evening at this wonderful establishment! everything down to the salads had a unique taste and was made to perfection. Our server was wonderful and everyone else dinning seemed to be enjoying their time as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for a great meal and a unique dining experience.~KAYMO21~Hoosick Falls, New York
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I visited during restaurant week. We ordered off the restaurant week menu. This provides three purse for the fixed price of $35. We both ordered the filet for the entree to be done medium rare. It came rare but was delicious so I did not send it back or complain. The filet was the same size, 8 ounces,as on a la carte menu and came with a choice of vegetable, we both chose creamed spinach. For appetizers  chose a piece of maple infused bacon and my wife had squash soup, which was good. For dessert my wife had blood orange sorbet and I had a fresh fruit bowl that was very well presented. I usually do not go to steakhouses but this one was a bargain on restaurant week. If you want to try it the next restaurant week in Philadelphia is in January. ~ramsey48~Mount Laurel, NJ
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and we couldn't have had a better evening. First time visiting this restaurant and after our visit it will definitely not be our last. The service was top notch. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we were well taken care of. The food was quite good. As one would expect the steaks were delicious. The hash brown potatoes were very tasty. My wife loved the crab cake and the onion soup was also delicious. We were given complimentary sparkling wine during appetizers and they also gave us complimentary baked Alaska with a lovely happy anniversary note in chocolate. It was so nice to feel special and make our evening that much better. Thank you to all the staff, we had an amazing time and will be back. ~Adam M~PA
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This Center City restaurant is at the corner of Walnut and 15th, in a former bank and then stock exchange. The interior is breath-taking: a warm autumnal glow permeates the large and spacious dining room which, despite its size, seems cozy and inviting. The traditional decor harkens to the 1920's or 30's, with amply spaced tables and booths. The small bar at the entrance was beautiful, warm, and welcoming. I arrived as a single diner, with a reservation made online, and although in jeans and a hoodie (the dress code is casual), was nonetheless politely received by the hostesses and promptly seated.  The menu, while more than adequate, was not overflowing with options, always a sign of a serious restaurant.  From the first tender bite of the New York Strip, I knew that this would be a wonderful meal.  The service was friendly, yet highly professional. The decor, the atmosphere, the food--everything was perfect.  For me, it might even be worth a special return trip from New York, just to bask in its glow again.~tuckernyc2003~New York City, New York
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place reminds me of a NYC bar with its grandeur and decadence, but with a smaller price tag. Only had drinks in the bar area with friends since we'd already eaten, but would definitely go back for a meal. Great ambiance and everybody dining and leaving seemed quite pleased with their experience here.~Deborah M~New York City, New York
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This steakhouse was so good! The waitstaff really knew their stuff from wines to steaks to side dishes their recommendations were fantastic. The hash browns were so tasty, I couldn't stop eating them. The calamari appetizer with roasted red peppers were a surprise but in a good way. We were on the fence and listened to the waitress. So happy we did! The place is old school. Attentive waitstaff cool quiet atmosphere. Can't wait to come back!~Margaret M~New York City, New York
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thoroughly enjoyed our recent dinner at Butcher & Singer. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Menu featured many traditional steakhouse dishes. The escargot, onion soup and wedge salad all were delicious. We had two perfectly prepared steaks for entrees (filet & NY strip).  Where Butcher & Singer really excelled was customer service. There was a small problem with our check in and being seated. The staff more than made for the misstep. They treated us to a shrimp cocktail, dessert and 2 drinks from the bar. Our server quickly realized that our potato casserole was over cooked - it was promptly replaced and removed from the check. Everyone at Butcher & Singer made us feel welcome. They went above and beyond to make sure our night was a memorable one. ~marcusr~buffalo
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for Restaurant Week in the fall and absolutely loved it. The restaurant week deal was great considering how expensive the prices were. My dining partner said it was the best steak he had ever had. The meat had the perfect temperature that I was looking for. The service was great and the inside of the restaurant was very nice with tall ceilings.~Athena732~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Worth every penny! Outstanding food and service!   You must order the hash brown side and lobster Mac. Yes please!~Alicia D~Chicago, Illinois
Butcher & Singer~1210686~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can get a great meal but be prepared to pay a lot!  Service is outstanding too! Side dishes are intended for more than one person and could be considered family style.~F P~Nashua, New Hampshire
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything was super. Ordered 5 plates for 2 of us but really needed only 4. The shrimp and the mushrooms was excellent. Sangria was ok but not great. I recommend this neighborhood place~Scott M~Bartlesville, Oklahoma
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent wine menu and good variety of both cold and hot tapas. We tried the patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo, croquetas and jamon iberico. Great service, awesome value for the high quality food.  We will definitely go back~Adriana V~Schaumburg, Illinois
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic spot. If you're in the area definitely a place to hit up. Food is full of favour and would recommend 3 dishes if you're hungry. Make sure you book. Thankfully 6.30pm suited us. But that's all they had. Awesome problem to have~biglad1~Belfast, United Kingdom
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Festive atmosphere with lots of attentive servers. Good variety of tapas including veggie dishes, plenty of meat dishes and paella. Try the brussel sprouts salad. Tasty sangria as well. In Lincoln Park close to blues and Wrigley.~ReefWatch~Indianapolis
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place for Spanish tapas and more. Vibrant and lively place, excellent food. Can get crowded with long wait times so make a reservation.  ~VSChicago~North Chicago, Illinois
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great selection of tapas and delicious food. The place has a great bar and lively atmosphere. The restaurant was surprisingly big but service was a bit slow and we waited for dome time to be seated despite having reservations. Good for a night out and sharing with friends.~lectu~Chicago, Illinois
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for a unique brunch experience and menu, this is a good place to start. Tapas for breakfast, WOW. Small plates of deep flavors...even the mini pancakes and waffle bites. The Bloody Mary bar was our friend's favorite...virtually a meal in a glass. We only visit Chicago but our next trip will definitely include another visit.~rslot~Murphy, Texas
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I went with our son and his girlfriend. Since this is a Tapas restaurant, we ordered 10 different dishes and shared it all. All I can say is that all 10 dishes were practically wiped clean and all four of us were thoroughly satisfied with each plate. This was a great experience.~Dan S~Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tapas...as long as you understand the concept of getting a bunch of items this place is a blast. I went with my wife and son and we tried about 7-8 dishes all of them were good but we all picked a few which made it a more enjoyable experience! With a big group grab a pitcher  as the normal cocktails can get pricy  ~Frank  R~Chicago, Illinois
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have a gluten free menu of tapas that are entirely appropriate for someone with Celiac, such as I. We had garlic potato salad, hanger steak, chicken/chorizo kabob, braised short-rib, chocolate cake (YES! GLUTEN FREE!) and carmelized banana with ice cream. And sangria.   The best of the bunch was the hanger steak and the mashed potatoes on the short rib plate. Sharing these small plates was great. Service was speedy and friendly. We really enjoyed the food, the waitstaff, and our time.~terrijane012016~Seattle, Washington
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This great Spanish Tapas Bar was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel in Downtown, as we were heading out to Lincoln Park for the evening.  To be honest, if I had just been passing I would not have looked twice at this place but I would have missed out.  It is a lot bigger inside than it looks, had a great atmosphere, great menu  and great Sangria.  Our server was very helpful and the food excellent.~Essjay9~West Sussex, England.
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a mixed review. In their favor, they sat us even though we were late for our reservation. Initially the service was on point but as the evening progressed we got less and less attention from our server and often had to ask other people for him or other foods we wanted to try. They were accommodating for a drink that tasted like socks (the mezcal mule- DO NOT GET IT) and the bursts was cold which I would have rather had warm but then braised short ribs without a doubt stole the show. The Brussels sprout salad was delish, the calamari was fresh and tender and perfectly fried. Overall, delish food, mediocre service. ~elroxkwell~Chelsea, Michigan
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unique and fun place to spend time enjoying out of the ordinary foods. Sampled a number of the topa's and they were all delicious. Friendly helpful staff and servers.~wk r~Minnesota
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a pleasant surprise this restaurant was. We had dinner with family there and the food was outstanding. It is a tapas restaurant with a multitude of selections. In particular you must try the paella. Our server was excellent and explained our choices.we tried all the desserts....yum~terwic~Newburgh, New York
Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!~430790~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we arrived in Chicago on a Sunday and havng brunch was mandatory. We managed to book a table at this place and we did not regret it. Many different options, food was very tasty (we had a few mimosas, eggs benedict and a tempura pumpkin special), although a bit on the oily side. Service was also very good and price was fair. Would definitely come back here again.~rcvx~Aucune
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A hotel restaurant that isn't an afterthought. The Cafe is located off the side of the building, separate from the bar. The room looks out over the patio and the street. There are rounds tables for a large party, tables for two and a few booths. The menu us small,  half dozen appetizers, some salads, four or five fish dishes, lamb and 3 steaks. There also a half dozen desserts. It was clear that the kitchen works to do everything very well, so not having a huge menu permits that. We skipped appetizers and went right to the fish. My wife had salmon and I had the branzino. Both were cooked perfectly, served hot and presented beautifully. We enjoyed both. We then had the ricotta beignets and the apple pie (more like a personal tart). Perhaps the best part was the service. Jackson and his team (Mate, Henry, Miles, Michael and Alexis) were personable and very helpful. They were fast with things like bread and bringing the food out when it was ready, and at the same time, made us feel like we had as much time as we wanted to enjoy the meal.~interluke1~Richmond, Virginia
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dined at Cafe Dupont on October 6th and found the staff very friendly and accommodating.  Ma'te', Jackson, Miles, Alexis, Khalifi and Michel were very attentive which is rare for a restaurant with outdoor seating.  My guest and I chose the roast duck which was properly cooked and very tasty.  For starters, try the mussels.~Mark L~Orlando, Florida
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything started off well as we were politely greeted and shown to our table. The server took our order quickly and the breakfast came in good order. However, after that we were ignored. Fair enough the place was busy but we just could not get the waitresses to come back to our table for more coffee. We asked the guy picking up if he would ask for more coffee, as to which we were ignored. I went up and asked the manager and again no coffee, which only came when my partner went and asked for the check and again asked for coffee. Don't know what the 'blind-spot' on our table was but service needs improving. 1st time ever in the states we left no tip.~Steve M~Leeds, United Kingdom
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been to Cafe Dupont several times for brunch, and I have never been disappointed. Here is what to expect: a crowded space, noisy, good service, good food, broad brunch menu. This is the place that you will want to come to meet with friends and family. It has an open and friendly atmosphere, and eating brunch is part of the experience of watching people on Dupont Circle through the floor to ceiling windows.   What I like about the menu, is that it has something for every appetite on it. There is light fare to heavy items if you are truly hungry. There are items that you can customize to your own liking, including designing your own Mimosa. ( Now, you will pay a nice price for that, but think of the experience). My favorite are their omelets, where you get to select from a listing of vegetables, meats and cheese to create your own omelet. The omelet is simply mouth watering- good.   As I gazed around the room, the Eggs Benedict appeared to be something that people ordered a lot, and the presentation of it was magnificent. My husband got the waffle with berries, and said that it was the best waffle he had ever had.   The only reason why this restaurant does not get a higher rating from me is that it is crowded, noisy, and pricey. If you aren't careful, you can spend a bundle on brunch, but I guarantee you will have enjoyed the experience. ~Kathleen G~Williamsburg, Virginia
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are in the Dupont Circl area on business and want a good breakfast in a great spot, try yeh cafe at the Dupont Circle Hotel. The food is very good, the prices are at the higher end (but fair) and the view of the city scene while you sit in the glass enclosed breakfast area is very nice.~Penn69~Santa Barbara, California
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My waiter, Henry, was incredible from the moment we stepped in. Anytime I needed anything Miles, another helpful waiter was there to help us. Service was just amazing. People were on point at all times. Adan and Alexis were super nice and so caring as well. These are the people I remember the most and who were so immediate to our care. And don't get me started on food; the soup bowls seemed like they'd never end! The special soup of the day was tomato, incredible! I've never had duck before and it was perfect. Not too dry and not too oily. I cannot rave enough about Cafe Dupont. I definitely plan on coming back next time with friends!! Thank you so much Cafe Dopont. I truly mean that.~EbonyPrice~State College, Pennsylvania
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Oh, my, you just wait forever for everything ... it's very painful and super annoying. T and I were lucky that a manager happened to spot out simmering expressions as we waited for someone to take an order. The food is mediocre, so I suppose the wait spares one from the reality of a meal not worth having.~Constant_traveller45~New York City, New York
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our organization booked a private room at Cafe Dupont. The space was beautiful and private. Our guests absolutely loved the food and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. I hope to return!~t1j2016~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Right place for a business meeting. Rather quiet, tables are far enough from each other, has smiling and discrete waiters, good coffee and comfy chairs. Were out of some of their listed beers.~ThomaLam~Peristeri
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Second night in DC. After a long day used Trip Advisor for a place nearby. Part of hotel which may be flag for me but the food was good and the service A+.  Our waiter pointed out drink specials and offered comments on the dishes.  No specials but soup of the day (potato) was really good. My wife had a great French onion.  Dessert a plus too.  Overall a nice experience. ~Dan P~Clinton, New Jersey
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The brunch menu is great and there eggs Benedict are delicious. I enjoyed sitting outside on the patio during happy hour~Marketmiami1~Miami, Florida
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good food. Loved the avocado and spelt toast. Have some very creative juices and smoothies. It can be a bit noisy but there is enough space between the tables so you don't overhear other conversations~Kauaidudette~Arlington, Virginia
Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner one night (the two of us) and just coffee the second nite with friends.  Our waiter both nites was Miles and the service was impeccable!  Friendly, informative, and what you would expect at the best restaurants you ever visit.  And the support staff was just as good with constant attention to the little things that make it a great experience.  We'll be back for brunch with friends in the morning!~Larryqpc~West Springfield, Massachusetts

Cafe Dupont~1897629~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we enjoyed both a lunch and dinner here while staying at the attached hotel. Both meals were very good and the service professional. ~Ryan49~Albany, New York
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~1. Great food and comfortable place 2. Super cool for your dog 3. Breakfast!! Open at 8:00 4. Take out! 5. Wine! 6. Light years better than Veggie Grill.~Dave M~Los Angeles, California
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything was made from fresh organic food & is made from scratch in the kitchen. Great service by the staff. Lots of range to choose from on the menu. Definitely do yourself a favour & go to this restaurant even if you are not a vego or vegan you WILL be pleasantly surprised. Could eat here every night~Pejola6772~Mittagong, Australia
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~From the first time that I visited Cafe Gratitude I was impressed and happy to be there. My positive impression was due to the beautifully designed space, lots of natural wood [tables, chairs] with polished concrete floors and juice counter. I was happy to be there because of the friendly staff who makes you feel right at home and happy to see you!  Every dish I've had [and some day I plan to experience the whole menu] has been freshly prepared and simply delicious. Their drinks/smoothies all have positive messages as names like blissful, alert and energized. My favorite meals are honest and humble. If you want to know what ordering the honest or the humble gives you, visit their web site to read the details. Trust me once you peruse the menu including eyeballing the list of raw desserts you'll book a reservation straight away although reservations are not necessary accept maybe on the weekends because of their perpetual popularity.  In any case I think it is impossible to have anything other than a positive experience at Cafe Gratitude so with such mouth watering choices for meals, what are you waiting for?~DaleOtt~Los Angeles, California
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I am grateful! Lunch was so good I want back for breakfast the next day. I could have eaten the whole menu - if you like vegan food you will love this place and if you don't think you like it you will now! GO!!! ~sullyontv~St. Petersburg, Florida
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just love this place and whenever I'm in LA I just have to stop by! Every spoonful is a fresh and fulfilling surprise. The food tastes amazing and it really is great knowing that whatever you choose from the menu you can't go wrong cause it's an all things good kind of place! ~Vanda Z~Athens, Greece
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I loved this restaurant. The menu is large, with lots of healthy food to choose from. The dishes are well described and have cool names too. Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty. Even the non vegetarians in our party loved the food. There's a good wine and cocktail menu too. Service was friendly and fast. I highly recommend this restaurant. ~ShaunaEMR~Sydney, Australia
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was there with my sister and mother.   I liked the sandwich and the cake very much, it was delicious.  My mother  (not vegan) hat the Ceaser's Salad and she asked me if this is really vegan because it's creamy and delicious.   When I return to LA this will be my first stop to have a nice dinner or lunch. ~SharifahR~Munich, Bayern, Germany
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'd heard so much about this place, I kinda couldn't help but go. This was my first LA breakfast destination and it was a lovely opener to the yoga/healthy eating vibe that exists in this area. Service was great, food fabulous and the vibe nice and chill. An easy option to default to, for sure. ~S R~Sydney, Australia
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved it. Went to the Larchmont Blvd location. My friend that I was visiting in LA recommended it and we went twice. Once for dinner and once for lunch. Cute patio area which is also dog friendly. I ordered The Happy Wrap with The Local Salad and The Complete 16oz fresh pressed juice. I loved that everything is organic and plant based here. Service was also friendly and prompt both visits.  ~beachloveOntario~Ontario
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved this place. Delicious and such lovely guys that work there.  The food is amazing - the muffins are a must as well as the salads and I love the daily gratitude question. ~Nikki T~London, United Kingdom
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend a Southern California native picked this spot out for us to eat at while on a short visit to Santa Monica. All of the food is ordered by making a statement "I am open hearted" etc,. what a fun and beautiful experience. ~Matthew F~Honolulu
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Such a great place for vegetarians and vegans :) I absolutely loved the place. I recommend trying out their health shots. The food is fresh and the place is completely instagram friendly - which means you will definitely end up getting some great pictures.~sugarspicenice~Mumbai (Bombay), India
Cafe Gratitude~3458135~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we ate lunch here with four adults and one child. The dishes are all vegetarian and perhaps vegan though I am not sure about this. I enjoy occasional vegetarian meals and always like vegetables as part of my omnivorous tendancy. I thought this place was extraordinary. I enjoyed my smoothie named "Strong" and my main course whose name I have forgotten. Their little quirk is when you order you say for example I am strong and you get that smoothie. I makes for a lot of fun as you attribute nice qualitites to yourself simply by ordering. They also have a question of the day that you have the option of answering and they share this with other patrons. Everyone in our party had a great time and all raved about the food. I think if you are looking for a nice vegetarian experience you can't go wrong here.~Bill W~San Marcos, Texas
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~14 of us had a farewell dinner after an Arctic cruise. Dinner was in a largish room with a spectacular view. The staff were very friendly and professional. As we were a group we had a set menu with 3 choice in each course. There was a good choice and the food was delicious, one very nice touch was the little tasters before the meal. A lovely night.~Anne S~Brisbane, Australia
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Canlis certainly lived up to their reputation. They have a wonderful atmosphere, terrific service and the meals were outstanding. Nothing was out of place. Don't miss this experience, it is well worth the time and money!.~Don E~Lakewood, Washington
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Canlis certainly lives up to their reputation.  A wonderful atmosphere, terrific service and the meals were sublime.  Nothing was out of place.  Don't miss this experience, it is well worth it.~alimentoD~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Canlis has reduced their bar to an apparent after thought. Ordered a Manhattan with either Makers Mark or Canadian Club. Sorry we do not have those anymore. What do you have? Some bourbon or rye I have never hear off. Ok bring me what you have. Could only drink half of it. I had my first Manhattan in 1970 at Canlis. I have traveled the world and never thought Canlis would have apparently turned into a wine bar. I ordered the filet medium. Received a very rare piece and decided I did not want a double cooked piece of meat. 10/21/2016~cougars71~Seattle, Washington
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Canlis is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. I have been a few times and it always was a great experience. The food is very good, but there are other restaurants with good food but none has the level of service that Canlis has.~Dan P~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Fantastic food and even better service!  Would love to go back again.  The owners made the experience all that much better.  ~mamafisher~Oak Harbor, Washington
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~It was a nice place for family and I also believe for business gathering. Nice view both for day and night. A little difficult to find the place, however we managed. We missed the Chef's Choice? will try next time.~778bol~Beijing, China
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Overall: *** Service: *** Food: *** Ambiance: ***** Value: ***  It is with a heavy heart that I say that Canlis will NOT be my restaurant for special occasions!    $300 for dinner (without wine) is to be expected for a restaurant with such good acclaim. However, for that price tag, I expect my taste buds to be tantalized. Perhaps my expectations were simply set too high.  If nothing else, our Friday dinner provided us with a great story to tell at our dinner party on Saturday night.   Expectation No 1. We would like to receive what we order. My husband is a meat and potatoes guy so receiving so not giving him a twice baked potato with his meat is a huge faux pas. After my husband received his entree sans sides, he waited patiently for a few minutes before asking someone if his accompaniments were on its way. He was advised that there was a mistake and it would take too long to order it now. He was not given the option of waiting for a full meal vs. an a la carte meal. Instead a bowl of truffle fries appeared and we were advised that it was complimentary as if they were bestowing a favor upon us. If we were interested in fries, we would have ordered fries so they sat at our table as a reminder that we did not get the requested sides.  2. I had indicated I'm diabetic and shouldn't indulge in sugar. They had two of my favorite starters and I had informed the server that I was having a hard time deciding if I wanted the foie gras or tartare. After seeing my uneaten dessert, the server indicated I should have foregone the dessert and had 2 starters, or simply just have 2 courses instead of 3 courses. It was a tad annoying that he provided this information after my meal rather than before but again, not enough of an issue to mar our dinner. .   3. The meals themselves were well done. Meat and seafood were both seasoned well and cooked perfectly. They were a tad zealous with their citrus on the sabayon but other than that, the food was good. Like I said, I wanted memorable or impressive tho' so good was a disappointment to me.   4. We were told that we don't need a valet tag as our car would be ready for our departure. We went outside and our car was not there. Shortly after, one of the valets approached us and asked "do you have an extra key?". I jokingly retorted "Why, did you lock my keys in the Jag"? and he confirmed that he did. At this stage, there was NO apology. He simply indicated that he would call an auto service and that we should go back in to have a drink. We didn't really have a choice so we went back into the restaurant. Upon reflection, I didn't want my car potentially damaged by a forced entry and more importantly, I did not want to waste anymore time as I needed to get home to prepare for our dinner party and overnight guests the next day. We took a taxi home to get our extra key so we could gain entry to our car.   Again, everything is relative. At a restaurant that boasts impeccable service, the entire experience was disappointing I've been in Seattle for over a year now and have tried over 100 restaurants - from casual to fine dining and this one was the most disappointing as I simply expected better.  So, be warned. Go for the romantic ambiance. Go for the extraordinary food art. Good for the experience. Just don't expect amazing food.~AFoodieChef~Seattle, Washington
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~The food and service were both exceptional and the setting and view are excellent. I will go back next time I get a chance!~Katurahsr~Charlottesville, Virginia
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~This restaurant has always been 5 star. I took my family for a celebration dinner. We had the best service in Seattle. The food was fabulous and prepared perfectly. Highly recommend this experience. Expect to pay $200 per person. Well worth it.~restuarantguy~eastside
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~This restaurants was the only New York style restaurant we ate at. Good food, great service and lovely views. Salmon was good salad was great, filet mignon was just ok. Dessert delicious.  Go here for a special night out. ~AnnieT652~Southampton, New York
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~This was our favorite restaurant in the whole world...until this visit. Dinner is now a set menu with several options. Two of us ordered the pork (something different) and were quite disappointed. It was mostly fat (more than an inch) with very little meat. I understand the necessity of the fat for the flavor, but there wasn't more than 3-4 bites of actual meat. The service is still impeccable and the wine list is awesome. Wines are over priced, but the selection is great.~Steve L~Victoria MN USA
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~We had dinner at Canlis Restaurant on our last night in Seattle.  We were lucky enough to get a table at short notice.  We knew the restaurant was fine dining and upmarket so we weren't put off by the cost of the experience.  On arrival we were greeted by the attendants who park your car.  We were absolutely amazed by the talent of these guys.  I'm sure they have a system in place to match guests with their cars but when we had finished our meal and walked outside our car was sitting there waiting for us and we hadn't even told them to expect us!  That was one of the many exceptional services we experienced at Canlis Restaurant.  The interior of the restaurant is warm and rustic with timber beams, stonework, fireplaces and huge floor to ceiling windows which offer a spectacular view.  Even though the restaurant is quite large it still provides a very intimate dining experience.  The waitstaff were incredible and very friendly and accommodating.  We had conversations with most of the waitstaff which may have been due to our Australian accents but probably because we like to chat.  Hopefully we didn't get anyone into trouble by keeping them talking for too long at our table.  We ordered cocktails which we had during our meal and the choice was interesting and the ones were chose were fantastic.  Our meal itself was outstanding.  The view from the terrace of the restaurant is also stunning.  If we ever visit Seattle again we would definitely have at least one dinner at Canlis Restaurant.~Linda B~Brisbane, Australia
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~We have friends visiting from out of town and somehow one of their significant others knew one of the owners.  Dinner was amazing and service was impeccable.  I have eaten here a few times, but because we had an in with one of the owners, we got a tour of the wine cellar and their behind the scenes going on....very impressive organization from the beginning to end.  They truly care.  How do they know which car is yours?~Hardingski~Enumclaw, WA
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~We were given dinner at Canlis for our anniversary.  I ordered the steak for which they are famous and told them about my allergy to seafood.  I told them in detail that I would not be able to breathe if my food was cross-contaminated.  They did cross contaminate it and we had to leave in a rush.  They sent me a $100 gift card as an apology. The gift card went unused.~Seattletravel_11~Seattle
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~When I receive such carefully orchestrated service---in every way---with each professional at the top of his/her game...starting with the initial greeting through every course of the meal, and then capped off by the perfect timing of my car just showing up---right in front of the restaurant... just as we're leaving (without even having to ask for it, of course)....I am blown away!! And I haven't even mentioned the food...which was (as always)...incredibly fine...~kmdani~Seattle, Washington
Canlis Restaurant~432552~Seattle~Washington~Traveler's Choice~Wow we had a wonderful evening recently at this gorgeous restaurant. The building is stunning with spectacular views of Seattle. The meal was delicious and able to satisfy all of our  varied palates, from seafood lovers to vegetarians. The service was outstanding. The servers were very professional , approachable and knowledgable.~luckyBaltimore~baltimore
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~ One of my favorite places in the Arcadia/Biltmore area. Great patio seating and great ambient, the service is excellent. The food is fresh and delicious and the portions are huge. They also are very kid friendly. Relaxing and comfortable neighborhood place perfect for happy hour and date night.  Higly recommended!~Carlos M~Colorado Springs, Colorado
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Chelsea's is the embodiment of a solid menu, very good food and fine service.   The Howie Burger was an amazing medley of taste and texture that could only be complimented by a fine beverage of which their selection is plentiful.  Ambiance and service is top notch.  The only thing that kept this from being a 5 Star Review was the parking fiasco in their lot.  Arrive early to avoid this issue and bonappetit.~JackDaWhack~Scottsdale, Arizona
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dined with friends. Food and service consistently very good. Upbeat atmosphere whether your dining inside or on one of the patios. Casual dining at its best.~Jim B~Phoenix, Arizona
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyed my dinner here a lot. Another winner in Phoenix. The restaurant has a basic decor that doesn't get in the way. I found it a touch noisy but that also gave it a nice buzz. The staff were very friendly and the service was prompt without being rushed. As a solo diner I like prompt service and I noticed my waitress kept thing moving for me while encouraging other parties to take their time.   I had the prime rib which was nicely cooked. I had it with the vegetables which were beets that day and very nicely cooked and presented. I had key lime pie for dessert which was too large a portion. The dessert was okay but nothing special. The watermelon sorbet is was served with was refreshing but I am not sure it paired that well.   Overall I enjoyed the meal and would go back again. ~DaQi~Irvine, California
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was at a conference in Phoenix and few of us decided to have dinner at Chelsea's kitchen. The restaurant is pretty big and has outdoor seating. The food, including the guacamole and the burger, were flavorful and the meat cooked nicely. The service is very efficient. We enjoyed our evening and I would definitely recommend trying it out if you're in town.~Alexis B~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Chelseas Kitchen many times and have never been disappointed.  The team is expert and friendly. The wrap around indoor/outdoor bar is unique and the food is consistently good to great.  I'm not a dessert fan so nothing to add here, but they've managed to make me a kale fan with their slaw.  ~Lizzy1956sfo~Scottsdale, Arizona
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just about as close to perfect and I can imagine....We ate here for a work function and everything was fantastic. The service was good, the food was great, and the back patio had a wonderful fireplace that made for a fun evening. The best part of the evening was that the place was full of all kinds of people. There were business meetings, family dinners, couples, and friends out having a good time. I prefer that type of environment as it keeps the place from getting stuffy. The food was great and my colleagues all said the drinks were well made. A must try if you are in the area.~Kelly H~Eden Prairie, Minnesota
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved this place so much! The outdoor seating area is super cute and not squished, like most outdoor sitting areas. It almost felt like I was in a quaint restaurant in Latin America. The food was yum. I had a crispy chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken was nice and crunchy without being greasy - it is spicy though so if you don't like spicy, ask for the sauce on the side. And the fries had a little bit of a kick to it but not too much. We also had the tuna tartar as an appetizer - it's topped with guacamole which makes it even more delicious. The service is definitely the best I've ever had in any restaurant. Our server was attentive and super sweet and accommodating. And bonus - they have free salted caramel cookies at the exit. Yum. Great place for brunch, lunch, dinner with friends, family, colleagues - anybody really. Enjoy!~Sptaz33~Chicago, Illinois
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My cousin and I recently met here at for a casual dinner. She is a regular, but this was my first time.  This place gets croweded fast, so the valet parking is a plus. We started the evening with guacamole and chips and the guacamole was freshly made and delicious! For dinner she had the kale and quinoa salad, which she enjoyed. I had the Chelsea cheeseburger...which was good, but nothing spectacular.  The prices were reasonable and the service was very attentive.  I would definetly come back again.~Touche57~Flower Mound, Texas
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nothing less than yummy yummy!  Sat at bar - great service.  Deviled eggs, short ribs, red velvet cake, French press decaf.   All excellent ....well cooked, good presentation.  I will go back!!!!    Mexcal mule with sprig tarragon was also excellent.~gogirls555~Tacoma, Washington
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Set cozily by a canal, Chelsea's Kitchen is an inviting venue for comfort food and easy-going socialization, whether for couples or small groups, inside the spacious dining room or on the outside arboreal patio. We dropped in for lunch and, from the extraordinary menu of diverse and inviting offerings, ordered the short rib taco platter and Chelsea's Cheeseburger. The short ribs were braised, moist, and perfectly prepared ~ fitting neatly into corn tortillas. The burger was juicy and mouthwatering, made to order at medium rare. These were ample servings and in no rush, we took our time to enjoy each and every bite. One of the treats upon departure are complimentary cookies. How do you not love a place that treats you lie a welcome guest and feeds you like you're royalty.~HerbPaine~Phoenix, Arizona, United States
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a very nice restaurant out in the suburbs off of E. Camelback Road. The restaurant has a lot of atmosphere - both indoors and outdoors. We sat on the terrace by the open fireplace. While waiting for our table, we sat at the bar, which opens out onto the terrace. The service was good and the staff were friendly. The trees on the outdoor terrace are covered with tiny white lights, which gives the place a lot of atmosphere. ~perryhs~Hornnes, Norway
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a refreshing treat everything was exceptional quality, service was great and prices were good for the price.~THOMAS M~SACRAMENTO
Chelsea's Kitchen~604109~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was packed on a Friday night around 6.  We had the salmon tacos, halibut special, and braised rib.  There halibut special was a small portion, but tasty.  Guacamole appetizer was good: excellent chips. Service was excellent.  No complaints at all, and I would return should I find myself in Phoenix again. ~steve~Newton, Massachusetts

Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place to come in off the street and sit for any meal.  Amazing coffee and breakfast.  Did not try any other meals, but had breakfast here three times sitting by the window and watching the troupe of people heading to work.  Looked like an amazing happy hour in an attractive outside area with smoker for BBQ.  Next visit hope to try out the outdoor entertainment area and dinner menu.  Lovely place, truly enjoyed our meals here.~Clown4321~Cincinnati, Ohio
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hole in the wall with good, hearty home cooking!  Friendly staff.  Well known in Lower Queen Ann.  Only suggestion would be that they add a second restroom.~Scott F~Fort Worth, United States
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My daughter and I were looking for a fun breakfast spot in Seattle so we stopped by Citizen Coffee.  We arrived at 10 am and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Menu is AWESOME!  We ordered breakfast tacos and banana coconut french toast and shared them both.  DELISH!  Highly recommend!~misopiso88~Seattle, Washington
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I visited in August and September 2016.   This cafe is rustic looking with indoor and outdoor seating. The menu is innovative and delicious and I cannot stress that enough.I had the Yogurt Parfait . It was greek yogurt that was topped with granola and seasonal berries and a bit of honey. That was soooooooo delicious!!!. One time i ate the breakfast sandwich with an egg and cheese and fresh tomato and arugula. this food is delicious and tasty and fresh. I highly recommend this place for breakfast. My friend had the crepe madam that came with scrambled egg. Delicious. I got a taste myself. I probably used that word one too many times but I think I got my point across!!  The price is fair and the food is divine. I highly recommend a visit there if you go through Seattle.~Miaj1975~Port of Spain, Trinidad
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I stayed walking distance from this great restaurant and walked over for breakfast and it was overall amazing! We loved everything, from the atmosphere to the customer service and food!! We DEFINITELY recommend it here!~elliechrisnavarro~American Canyon, California
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in here as I was staying at a nearby hotel and walked into good, filling unpretentious food. Had a crepe Madame which was delicious. They also serve breakfast all day ~Jennifer S~Winston Salem, North Carolina
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This little coffee nook was around the corner from our hotel & we visited based on recommendations from several sources. Great coffees! Great breakfast!  Great service!  Some different things on their menu; all were delicious. The buckwheat crepes are very good... I tried the Citizen Crepe & it was very tasty!  ~gracefall07~East Providence, Rhode Island
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is at the corner of Roy and Taylor streets. It's decor is adorable and I loved it as soon as I walked in. I had the Croque Madam crepes with cheesy potatoes. The crepes had a little too much arugula for my taste but it was otherwise tasty.   Would definitely go back there again and try other dishes. ~Martin_Karen76~Elgin, Illinois
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was right across the street from our hotel and I immediately fell in love with the machiatto. We also had breakfast but I found it a little over priced but it was tastey and fast. But seriously try all the coffee!~mylilraynedrop~wimberley tx
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took us a while to get served because the place was slammin on a Sunday morning but well worth the wait. Food was fresh, tasty and service was remarkable considering the crowd~amycR6030BR~Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We decided to stop in for breakfast. My wife had the biscuits and gravy with Andouille sausage. The gravy was true sausage gravy, the biscuits although a little dry were good and she loved the sausage. I had the farmers breakfast with Andouille sausage. The eggs cooked perfectly the potatoes were nicely flavored and the sausage was great.  All in all there is nothing we really could complain about.  The service and staff was excellent. We would recommend this place if looking for good food at a good price and be able to enjoy in a small quaint establishment. ~Kevin O~Gainesville, Virginia
Citizen Coffee~1724258~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were visiting from the Phoenix area and were staying next door. After a less than stellar continental breakfast presentation  next door we decided to try this place out.   So glad we did!   We are here every morning. Hubby loved the coffee, I loved the caramel apple steamer. We had breakfast here every morning during our stay. We even came over for lunch... and cocktails!  The infused tequila is amazing in the "Roberto" if you're a margarita lover like me.   We loved the neighborhood vibe. So different than the burbs where we live.  The employees were super friendly and helpful.   Next time we are in Seattle... we will return for another cup! ~Deb S~Chandler, Arizona, United States
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A group of friends in town for a convention. We decided to try City Tavern. The authentic restoration of the building and period accuracy gave us the feeling of traveling back to colonial times. As we were dining in the evening the entire place was candle lit which created a beautiful ambiance. Live music was provided by a harpist in the foyer. The wait staff was friendly and helpful, as well as being dressed in period costume. We all enjoyed our meals. We particularly enjoyed the tenderloin medallions and the rack of lamb. ~JCRainbow~Whitmore Lake, Michigan
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~City Tavern has a history that dates back to before the Revolution War.   It's like stepping back in time.  The food and the presentation is excellent.  I had the Pork Medallions which was a favorite dish of Thomas Jefferson.   My glass of Porter was made from George Washington's recipe.  Our waitress, Janelle, helped make our dinning experience extra special.~Paul M~New Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~City Tavern is where our local friend had to take us for the building and history that you feel just being in there. There was a man playing the harp when we came in. The building was fun to explore with all the different dining rooms upstair and in every corner. The food was good, and we the dining space was beautiful.~Linda R~Cottonwood Heights, Utah, United States
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dining at City Tavern was a wonderful experience. The tavern of choice of our Founding Fathers and with food provided by a famous chef, our meal could not have been better. Wait staff was attentive, the building is gorgeous and the menu choices made it difficult to choose. The salmon and the beef that we enjoyed were perfectly cooked and garnished. Great experience for anyone from young to old. The perfect way to top off your visit to historic Philadelphia! ~kseedo~Binghamton, New York
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyed a great first time visit on Friday.  Good food, great ambiance and wonderful service by our server Greg.  We will be back.~Regina R~Somerset, New Jersey
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Greetings from Bedminster, NJ.  My son Alexander and I frequented the Tavern yesterday and our meal consisting of potato leak soup, Chicken pot pie and the roasted duckling.  We had the Raspberry Shug which we found tasty but on the sweet side. Lemon wedges remedied that for us and we also decided on the hot cider and wasil which we found the opposite and sugar remedied that for us. Overall our experience was great and our server Greg was knowledgeable and efficient. The highlight of our luncheon was the opportunity to meet Chef Walter Staib personally.~susannechristie3~Bedminster, New Jersey
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Historic charm comes with this historic tavern in old city Philadelphia! The menu sounded delicious and the food lived up to the expectation! I had the corn chowder and pork chop and it was all delicious!~Dan M~Oaklyn, New Jersey
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was a gorgeous Autumn day in Philadelphia.  As we walked around admiring the sites we stumbled upon the City Tavern.  We just had to stop in.  The entire staff wore period clothing that added a nice atmosphere to this historic restaurant that was established in 1773.   We indulged in a Bloody Mary and a dark porter along with the Pepperpot Soup which had just the right amount of spice.  The bread included a delicious small gingery biscuit that was so good.  My boyfriend had the Crab Cake and I had the huge Salmagundi salad.  The salad originates from early 17th century England.  It was actually a Cobb salad.  It was loaded with nicely smoked turkey, ham, cheddar cheese, egg and the usual salad stuff.  The Service was great and very quick.  Very nice lunch at a memorable Tavern.~Deborah T~Chicago, Illinois
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family and I went to "City Tavern" for lunch. It was DELICIOUS!!! The waiters were super nice and the entire place looked and was designed to look like what it used to look like a long time ago! The food was great and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!~Jewelssssssssss~Bay Harbor Islands, Florida
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The complaints about surly waiters triggered memories of a bad experience a few years back. I produced a coupon for a free drink with a meal -- that I had gotten at a museum. possibly Franklin Institute -- and the waiter in colonial garb not only wouldn't honor it but treated me like some sort of criminal trying to get away with something. I never went back.~Muffin2006NewYork~New York
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was given task to choose dining location for 7 ladies on a business trip. So happy I chose City Tavern. Upon arrival we discovered the person who took my reservation only listed it for 2 diners. The staff took hold of the issue and after directing us to an area where we could wait they brought us to a wonderful room on lower level.  One of our party has difficulty with stairs and since the building is a reproduction of original ( due to fire) and does not have elevator they were able to take her out the back door and around the side and have her enter through the kitchen.   Food was exceptional and authentic.  Bread was receives from colonial times but not my favorite with regard to taste.  I had a lobster pot pie that was filled with chunks of seafood.  Interesting and fun seasonal drinks also.~Linda L~Monroe, New York
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We found out about this tavern while visiting the Independence Hall Visitor Center through the NPS paper describing the area, which had a 2 for 1 meal coupon in it. We had a mid day lunch so enjoyed a very quiet setting. Our lunch of Escalope of Veal was excellent, as was our service by Greg. It was nice to enjoy an excellent lunch, while sitting in a historic tavern, and thinking of all of the significant people from throughout our history who have eaten here.~Jim B~Grapeview, Washington
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the rabbit and venison.  Tasty.  Very large portions.  Live harp with period music.  Attentive service by Greg.~Finndance~Ithaca, NY
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited for lunch and had a wonderful experience.  Try to sit outside if the patio is open.  We enjoyed the sampler of ales, all of which are made according to recipes developed by some of the Founding fathers.  Delicious! ~TravellingMamas~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
City Tavern~478486~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While visiting the historic part of Philly, my husband and I needed food.  Several people had suggested City Tavern.  We arrived around 3:30 pm and we're seated.  A delightful "pilgrim", Janelle, helped us decide on our meals.  We ordered the pork medallions (one of Jefferson's favorites), the porter (made from Washington's recipe), the braised duck legs and an apple crisp with cinnamon ice cream (shared).  A delightful meal!!!  We were able to visit quite a while with Janelle, a very competent and vivacious "pilgrim" because of the hour!  An awesome experience!~Lynn M~Summerdale, AL, United States
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Family owned with reasonable prices and good seafood. Full bar steamed clams and good menu. Atmosphere was like eating waterside.  Waitress was nice and knew menu by heart.~sgmcneil~Middletown, Indiana
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Found this place because we were hungry for seafood and wanted something close to our hotel.  It was amazing.  We sat at the bar, service was great and everything was delicious.  We had steamed clams and the fried seafood platter.  All was terrific, but scallops and fried clams strips were unforgettable.  Can't wait to get back and share it with friends.  Thank you for a great experience!~JoP632~Cameron, Missouri
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Found this place via the Liverpool Knight's Inn's list of local restaurants.  Loved the seafood and the cozy bar atmosphere.  Would love to come back.~buzzrdly1~Nebraska
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just returned from eating dinner at the Clam Bar. Being a Saturday night it was busy . After a short wait we were seated in a back area just two tables so totally missing the bar atmosphere and vibe. But it got worse from that point on, we were soon to discover this was staff work alley, staff coming and going carrying garbage out the back door, going out for smoke breaks,caring out buckets of kitchen waste,each time the outside door kept banging closed and letting in cold air and smoke. Also waitresses going up and down to the basement for supplies right beside us. I wish I had taken pictures as it was so excessive you really would not believe it. On the brighter side we had a great waitress and the food was very good sadly our experience had already been tainted. After paying the bill I did speak with the manager and explained what we had experienced. She said it would be reviewed. I hope this changes so others don't experience what we did.~kiwiroo2015~Burlington, Canada
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~LOVE this place.  Iconic local seafood and pasta place, great atmosphere, locals add color, fantastic food and service.  Never miss a chance to eat here when I can. My personal preference is the Linguine with White Clam sauce, but anything you order here is great.  Can't say enough about it. ~Kevin W~Syracuse, New York
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I had dinner here last night to celebrate our wedding anniversary as we wanted good seafood.  They start you off with warm bread and delicious garlic herb butter.  We had the clams provincial appetizer and they were wonderful as well.   The salad is "eh" as it was 98% iceberg lettuce and I am definitely biased against iceberg due to its poor nutritional value.  For the main meal I had stuffed sole which came with a large amount of crabmeat stuffing and my husband had backened grouper - both were excellent!  For dessert I had the chocolate peanut butter pie and my husband had apple caramel pie - again very good.   Our service was perfunctory but we could see that the table across from us had a wonderful waitress.   Since the food was so good, I still gave it a good rating.~KipDylan~Syracuse, New York
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not the first time I have been here and each time you worry about what you may eat as the external and internal appearance does not indicate the quality of the food.  My fifth visit and I have not been disappointed. The Clam chowder is a good starting point.  The main dishes all have been  excellent. I have not been disappointed with my choice as I try something different every time. ~bashfop~Bournemouth, United Kingdom
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Staying in Syracuse for a few days on the job.  Checking out the local eateries; finding some very good food.  Unfortunately, it was NOT at the Clam Bar.  This is a small and, judging by the number of people, popular place.  First thing you need to know is, there are no accommodations for handicapped persons.  If you are in a chair or have mobility issues, this is not your place - four or five steps at both entrances.   We made it up the stairs okay and were seated at a small table when we asked for one.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  Menu, and signs around the room, trumpet "fresh" seafood.  I know better, and I should have asked.  Ordered the fried shrimp; husband had the fried combo.  Both came with a salad, bread, and one side.  He had a baked potato and i had wild rice.    So:  Nothing in the seafood, on either of our plates, was fresh.  Every bit of it was frozen, hadn't been fresh in awhile.  It was edible, just.  Husband's baked potato had been baked for way too long; had that awful starch smell they get when they're held over too long.  Bread looked great - nice homemade loaf - but it was dry, dry, dry.  Salad was the usual bagged mix; it was fresh, however.  So, a very disappointing evening. I will say this;  i saw food on other plates that looked wonderful.  I saw pasta with what looked like fresh seafood; I saw lots of broiled and steamed food that looked fresh.....I wish I had been told that all the fried food was frozen.....I would have ordered differently.~Cobwebs11~Texas Panhandle
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Clam Bar is awesome. The clams in any form are the most tasty you will ever have.  It has been around for awhile and the bartenders know everybody.  It looks like a dive and is crowded inside, but it is one of the best places in Syracuse to eat seafood. ~gary r~Naples, Florida
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has been around for years.  It is not the brightest place in the world, carpeting is dingy and light is dim.  Food and Hospitality is fresh and great. I believe the hostess is the owner's wife.  Very nice and attentive.  The quarters are bit tight but the food makes it worthwhile.  They always are busy.~exptraveler2016~Syracuse, New York
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Travelling up I-81 we stopped in Syracuse for lunch. Not much to look at outside but the food was very good. Will return on our next trip~1petworth~Winchester, Canada
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We recently dropped off our daughter at SU and one night we had dinner here and it was great! Delicious clams, chowder. etc. I wish that we could have gone again but the visit was short. We will return!~Mary Beth M~San Francisco, California
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were told by our hotel that we absolutely had to go to the Clam Bar, so we did. First off, the place is run down.  We were seated in a booth where the seats had no padding left which had us sink lower only making the table feel higher. Wait staff need a lesson on how to dress and keep their hair away from food. The food was ok.  We had clams; clam chowder and mussels. These are the norm for us when we go out for food...the Clam Bar let us down. We did not enjoy the Clam Bar~Gwen S~ON, Canada
Clam Bar~421575~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were traveling through and wanted something other than a franchise restaurant. This place is old and a little dingy but their food and service more than make up for it. My husband had the fish and chips- he said it was really good and the chips were especially fantastic. I had snow crab legs and they were fresh and plentiful. Salt potatoes? I guess they're a seasonal offering- I never found anything special about them. The table was always being cleared, and the wait staff were attentive. We would definitely return!~SabrinaWallace~Belleville, Canada
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic meal, and the portion are massive, so it may seem pricey but it's defiantly worth it. ( don't get a starter tho ). Quirky restaurant on the south side of 5th avenue.  They have live music on for the entertainment. The downside was that we where based at the top of the restaurant so we couldn't enjoy the live music. We felt abit out of the way. You need to book in advance otherwise you won't get a space unless you sit at the bar, which is a little cramped.  Highly recommended if you love the steak. ~Abbey S~Chester, United Kingdom
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been to several Steak Houses in NYC and this is the first one where we didn't even finish our steaks (either of us).  Yes it was that bad. Unfortunate, since I really wanted to like this place.  Very cozy and intimate.  Maybe it's a one off, I don't know, but it's not a place we'll be rushing back to any time soon given all the great steak houses in the city and prices.   The kitschy thing they do with the birthday photos and dessert didn't help either...~nguyem9~New York City, New York
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having first eaten here in January 2014, went back in October 2016 as I had a meeting in NY and went with my US colleagues.  Since I last visited, this place has gone from No 1 on TripAdvisor (hence the reason we first went) to (more recently) number 14.  The place is still unbelievably good, the service excellent and the food quality as good as any steak place I have eaten.  My NY based colleagues who openly stated that after 20 years in NY they have pretty much been to all the great steakhouses had never been and said it was up there with any they had ever eaten.  I know NY has '000s of places to eat and I should try more but this place is well worth a visit in my opinion.~SGG372~Bolton, United Kingdom
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like my food served hot, just like it came out of the oven. If you dine on the prettier as well as romantic floor of the two floors (which is the 2nd floor) your chances of that happening are reduced because the food runners have to go up a flight of stairs from the back end of the restaurant and take it to the front. The 2nd floor has a very romantic appearance because of its large street front window that faces a tree on the street whose branches are lit up with tiny white light bulbs (see my photos below), giving a Christmas like effect. I sat on the second floor. My complimentary large mushroom ravioli was served at room temperature. My order of Double Lamb Chops ($38) were hot, but not ideally hot. It was not long before they were warm. As a result, I would say that I would give them 3-1/2 stars out of 5. The complimentary dessert was a very decent size that included a delicious Profito Roll and a very ordinary Terimisu. I suggest that you request two Profito Rolls and do without the Terimisu.~Harvey M~New York, United States
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was apprehensive after reading reviews that complained about over-zealous service. Well we got exactly the opposite! Waited over 60 minutes for our meal to start, but I have to say once I made the maitre aware we were well-treated. Complimentary pasta starter (which was actually very good indeed!) and a free top-up of the red wine. Steaks were good but not outstanding. Overall for a NYC steakhouse a bit of a let down, but not a disaster~Clive T~Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My boyfriend took me here for my birthday whilst we were in New York!   The steak was amazing and tender and the portion sizes are generous! Meal was topped off by the complimentary trio of desserts that were delicious!   We will be returning next time we are in town! ~lucylala11~London, United Kingdom
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife took me here for my birthday as we love NY steakhouses.  Sorely disappointed from the moment we walked in.   Cocktail ordered, didnt arrive for 25mins. Wine list ... very short and very little champagnes.   Order 2 steaks, my wife's was overcooked and mine was overcooked and worse still cold.   We told them we were Gluten free yet they still brought us bread!  and then brought us a plate of deserts... we asked if they were GF ... they said NO. So why bring them to us ?? To tease us!  Very poor! Could have munched them and been gluten poisoned!    Mortons, Strip House, Lincoln Sq ... so many good Steakhouses in NYC .... this is not one!~Clive R~Pangbourne, United Kingdom
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Such a lovely place for dinner! Genuine food and good service. The meat were perfectly cooked. Couldn't ask for more!~andh75~Paris, France
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tastefully decorated this is the perfect steak house. There is actually room between tables and your neighbor is not sitting in your lap like some supposed top notch steakhouses. Reception was warm and friendly. Service was impeccable. The waiters actually listen to you when you make a special request. The food was sensational. The salads were perfect and the white bean soup was out of this world. The ribeye steaks were perfect as were the sides. Since it was our first visit we were comped on dessert which was a trio of cream puffs, tiramasu and chocolate cake which were superb. Every course was top notch in quality, preparation and taste. The pace was filling up but no one rushed us. This was truly a memorable experience and it is already on my calendar for my February visit to NYC.~bankruptcy~Millville, DE
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our 2nd time visiting Club A Steakhouse. The first time we dined here about 2 years ago we sat upstairs and enjoyed our dinner. This time we were asked if we preferred up or down when we arrive. A jazz duo were playing set up right between the bar and dining area downstairs so we choose to sit downstairs and were promptly seated at a nice table for two. I liked the red clubby look to the decor, a little bit different than my memory of upstairs (which was also very nice). We ordered 2 pieces of bacon to start (very good, large, smoky and tasty), the porterhouse for 2 (ordered medium though it came out withe a medium rare thing sticking out of it on the sign, we just let the meat cook a bit on the plate as we served to ourselves and it was actually perfect for our taste). We had an order of the garlic rosemary fries and each had a drink (he a martini, me a glass of red wine). The entire meal was very enjoyable not to mention the service was great and the complimentary dessert sampler was delicious. We will be back from time to time when in the mood for a porterhouse and a celebration (this was a birthday).~julesj66~NYC
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unfortunately on my moms 60th birthday flying into NYC from Tampa we picked this restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday. We made our reservations on Open Table hours prior. When we got there we ordered a bottle of Caymus and enjoyed our bottle. Then after one hour and twenty minutes later we notified our server and other servers that we needed our food due to my brothers diabetes. No food after 1 hour and 20 minutes is ridiculous!  This made no impact at all. We finally got our food and it was ok at best. Our Mom's birthday dinner was ruined and we never made it to dessert. I spoke to the family owner/ manager on my way out and he seemed uh about the whole thing.  I'm sad to think on this very important trip we got uh service after paying a decent sized bill! Deliver the service you speak of and do it in a timely please.~Carrsy~St. Petersburg, Florida
Club A Steakhouse~1236281~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here to celebrate our daughters turning 18 and 21.We were treated to a complimentary ravioli each which was excellent! The steaks were all cooked to perfection,we all enjoyed our meals.The staff were helpful and attentive without being too intrusive,and we were also treated to a complimentary dessert for the girls! Thank you Club A steakhouse for an excellent evening!~fancie1966~isle of wight
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best Italian bread and flat bread around! also great sandwiches,, Had the meatballs in a heel,they put 4 to 5 meatballs in about 1/3 the loaf  of bead , remove bread from center fill with meatballs and plug top with bread removed from middle .. its to die for ,,~Eeyoreslife~Apollo Beach, Florida
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best bread in Syracuse.  It's been a tradition to pick up a loaf or 3. Also, try the subs next door. You won't be disappointed~gogetgabby~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~By far the best tasting and freshest Italian bread in all of Syracuse! It's worth the stop to get this quality and flavor, there really is a difference!~Phil O~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Columbus Bakery has the best Italian bread ever.  My son had a house warming party recently and I picked up six loaves to take to Buffalo.  He was pretty excited to help me unload that from the car.  Even when he was a little boy, we never got home with a whole loaf of bread as he would tear off pieces to eat on the drive.~maierc200~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Columbus Bread has been a famous landmark for decades in the city of Syracuse. A famous quote by the patrons is "buy two loaves of bread because you will eat one on the way home."~Sandy C~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good for hot & fresh Italian bread? (It only has breads) Nothing but an old school brick oven baker.~Okoniewski~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I go here often as it is close to my office. You get bread, and if you are lucky, maybe some pizza dough. The bread is fantastic and you can get loaves in a couple different varieties. Buy one extra for the ride home.~falcon2012~syracuse ny
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have purchased bread there many times over the last forty years and have always found it to be excellent and at a reasonable price.~bnickr~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I would have rated excellent except the many times you go here and they have no "POINTS" (regular Italian bread) because they run out.  It's disappointed when you travel from the suburbs specifically to enjoy this with your Sunday meal and they have none available.  SUGGESTION:  make more on certain days......~Janet E~Syracuse
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are loking for fresh bread, still hot form the oven for your Italian dinner, this is the real deal!!!.~Adrian L~Cicero
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Since the ovens started operating in the 1890s Columbus Bakery continues to offer the freshest and best Italian bread around. Never a disappointment with this establishment. Incidentally, their meatball in a heel sandwich is to die for. We drive 70 miles for their bread and now we have friends doing the same.~deeleft~Endwell, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Some of the best bread in Syracuse. The flatbread is so good you just can't wait to eat it! We usually polish one off on our way home.~roadtrips4life~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have been around for years. Family owned.  Love their bread.  Baked fresh daily.  Best bread around.  They also have a great deli with Boarshead meats.~Nutsaboutcrusin~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an icon in CNY.  I believe it is one of the oldest commercial ovens in Syracuse. Their bread is the best! Warning if you don't buy extra, put the bread in the trunk or you will eat it on the way home!~Barry B~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the oldest and most reliable bread bakery I have ever been to in my life.  They have the best Italian bread, hands down.  They are using the same recipe, same ovens and some of the same staff that I have known for 5 decades.  You have to get there early as they typically sell out by 1 or 2 in the afternoon.  One simple hint, get any extra loaf because as soon as you get into your car and start enjoying the smell, you'll never get home without eating some.~Greg C~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very old school bakery, you walk in and it's like you are in the middle of the baking process with people rolling dough and ovens cooking.  Obviously it smells great.  For those not in the know....it is a take out bread place, not really a restaurant.  They have a cooler box with a few other items in it, but this is all about the bread.  And the bread is excellent.~2fromTX~Deep South Texas
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walking into the bakery is a fun experience.  The ovens are off to the left as you walk in, and the aroma of baking bread is overwhelming.  I typically stop and absorb the smell of breads in the oven, before I purchase a great, tasty, wonderful Italian loaf of bread.  And, usually I purchase two loafs before leaving with an aromatic delight.~Tom B~Syracuse, New York
Columbus Baking Co~825489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a Sunday family meal. We had to stop down to Columbus bakery to get some bread. We got their flat bread for the first time and it was amazing. Try a loaf or 2.~chris13209~Syracuse, New York
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Commissary not only has a great menu of unique cocktails, but their bartenders are friendly, fun and actually pay you mind.   Their managerial staff are seasoned and truly care about their patrons' feedback - be it positive or constructive criticism (of which I can't imagine there is much).   Their one bartender, Brock, is so great that I now go to Commissary for his service since he moved about a year ago from another bar in DC. Brock makes the atmosphere like a scene from Cheers, and somehow always knows EVERYONE'S names.   See you tomorrow for happy hour, Commissary!~marykate7882016~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and fast service . Huge portions. Brock the bartender was engaging and made our visit a great experience . Will be back Ken & Marie ~H4066YJkenm~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great night at the Commissary, wonderful experience, great staff and food. Our Server was excellent and  We really enjoyed the Brussels Sprouts, Gnocchi and Mussels. We will be back...~VACNUT~Michigan
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can't say enough good things about this place. Very welcoming. Bartender Brock whips up some awesome craft cocktails and will keep you laughing. Where does he get all his energy?!~OompahLoompah~Spencerville, MD
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had breakfast at the Commissary on both Saturday and Sunday whilst in Washington last week. I usually do not eat  at the same place twice on my first visit to a city but not only did I enjoy the food here but also the general atmosphere of the place and the friendliness of the staff, especially the bar tenders that worked on Sunday 6th November. I had steak, eggs and home fries on both days but also tried the blueberry buttermilk pancakes that were part of my friends breakfast on Saturday. Eggs and steak were cooked to perfection and the home fries really tasty. I liked being given a choice of breads with the breakfast and having chosen sour dough I was pleasantly surprised as breads in the US tends to be pretty bad in general, especially when compared to bread in Central Europe. Sunday mornings are super busy at this place so I would recommend booking if you want to sit at a table without having to wait. Seating at the bar is on a first come, first served basis, which means you can take a seat if one is available without checking if it is indeed free. Lots of people have either a Bloody Mary (not of the virgin variety) or Mimosa with breakfast which could have been tempting...another time. I was most surprised at one Bloody Mary having two rashers of crispy bacon in it (terrible photo attached) but can see how they might go well together... I would certainly give that one a try!  If like me you are not quite ready for alcohol before noon, try one of their smoothies, the one I had on Sunday was delicious! I had coffee on the Saturday which I did not like as it had a bitter taste, but that would not stop me going back...just would not have coffee there again~Irmgard H~Corby, United Kingdom
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I recently had brunch for the first time at Commissary and I will go back again.  You are greeted by very friendly hosts/hostesses and the wait staff was friendly and attentive and always ready to refill the drinks.  If you want to have a fun and casual meal with friends and not feel the pressure to leave as soon as your are finished eating, Commissary is the perfect spot. ~kredgar~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just a great place! Food, staff and cocktails are great! I highly recommend stopping in for an app and cocktail! If Brock is working you will definitely have a great laugh as well! You don't want to miss out!~Amanda D~New York City, New York
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came. This is Commissary.  I describe it to friends as 'relentlessly friendly'.  The food is good, but the amazing thing about this restaurant is the vibe.  The GM, Heidi, has a contagious laugh and smile.  If you hear a big laugh from the corner -- that's Heidi.  Commissary is one of the few joints in Logan or 14th street that serves a proper breakfast every day.  Blueberry pancakes are my go to order, but the breakfast sandwiches (sub in a bagel) are also great.  And one of the few places in town with proper potato pancakes (sour cream and apple sauce, yes please). The weekend has a proper eggs Benedict.~scotthuddle~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here not long ago with some friends for brunch and I couldn't have been happier with my experience! The servers were very attentive and the drinks were expertly crafted. Will recommend to all my other friends as our next go to brunch spot :) ~Rend A~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Commissary~1179806~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whether you are going to the Commissary for the food, the cocktails, or the atmosphere, it is definitely a place not to be me missed. Make sure you go when Brock is the bartender as he will keep you in stitches!!! Can't wait to go back!~srs609~Richmond, Virginia
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Awesome venue from decor and ambiance to service and food. Sommelier was the highlight. Full to capacity on a Monday night as opposed to other "hot" restaurants we visited on the weekend that were empty.~MandDplus2~Toronto, Canada
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Craft is consistently at the top of any list of Century City restaurants. You can sit inside or outside beside the bar area for drinks and amazing appetizers for happy hour (3-5).   Or enjoy dinner in the dining room area. The food here is as good as it gets...with many exceptional dishes. The three or five course sampler was particularly exquisite.  Service is equally exceptional.  There are no criticisms of this restaurant....it's all good!~robertjk520~Temecula, California
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great menu but perhaps under sells the dishes. The dishes are designed to be shared and there are lots of choices. Each one we had was delicious and good quality. A couple of minor hiccups in service were quickly fixed. Surprisingly not very busy on a Friday evening and we were the last to leave at 1030.~Chris C~Sydney Australia
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a small group business meeting (10 people) in the private room off the main dining room. The food was excellent, try the beet salad, and the service matched.  The room was a little noisy as the door didn't seal out all of the noise from the high energy lunch crowd in the main room.~whereaminow14~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Craft in Century City for lunch meetings a number of times and always had a pleasant experience. However, my wife continually bugged  me to take her there. So last night we celebrated my wife's birthday and our 46th wedding anniversary with 3 couples, our closest friends.  We sat at a corner table and were presented with menus which had "Happy Birthday Dorene" and  "Happy Anniversary Dorene & Marty" prominently printed on top.   The service was outstanding.  The wine suggestions were excellent, and the food exceptional. We shared appetizers and sides. The volume of food was substantial. Several of us commented that the noise level was very low and we were actually able to converse.   All in all, I highly recommend Craft and being great food and service for a fair price.   ~F1966IQmartinl~Beverly Hills, California
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I were staying at a nearby hotel for a work/pleasure trip in conjunction for our anniversary. This place is rated VERY high on Trip Advisor, and given the size of LA I took this to mean this was a special place. Perhaps our experience was an aberration, but I left not impressed. This is not to say the entire night was a bust, but I left there thinking if I lived in LA I would not return.   Everything was served family style, meant to share, which really I like. My wife and I often share our dishes so this made it easy. We started with the arugula, pine nut and parmesan salad. I thought the dressing was just ok, and the paremsan seemed to be on just one part of the salad, in a clump. Our entrees came after a bit-my wife ordered the halibut, simply seared with a light mushroom sauce, while I ordered the flat-iron steak. We also had a side of their Brussels sprouts. Her halibut was very good, but not that large and therefore really not conducive for sharing. My flat iron was about 10 strips in a cast iron skillet. Sadly, it was barely lukewarm. I sent it back to be reheated with a staff member (not our waiter). While I waited I had the sprouts, which were the highlight of the dinner. They were fabulous, with a char on one side that enhanced their flavor. My dish was brought back, and it was the exact same temperature as when it was sent back. Sigh. I went ahead and ate it, because at this point my wife was nearly done with her dish. The flavor was quite good, but clearly it would have been better if it was properly heated. I don't understand how a fish dish can be hotter than a meat dish. Our waiter never inquired about our meals, nor did he ask if my issue had been rectified. This was absolutely reflected in the tip.   Overall, the service was excellent, however. It was just our waiter that was inattentive.   I would not return.~spokanedavid2002~Seattle, Washington
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our meal was delicious, and their avocado-tomatillo salad was stunning.  I wish I could get tomatillos here at home.  They are more than happy to share recipes, which I like.  But a warning....we are small eaters, and shared an entree, and boy! there is a lot of food!  They are generous in their portions and house appetizers.  A great restaurant.~birgit f~Vancouver, Canada
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere was great, the service was good, attentive and showy. This is a stylish place.  But this is also a restaurant, where people might want to come to have food.  Yes, they do serve food.  And some of it is pretty tasty. All of it is expensive, to the point of absurdity. Their business model is amazing:  everything is served for the table, meant to  be be shared.  This family style idea only works when there is sufficient food for more than one person.  For instance, we had a pasta dish,  where the piece of stuffed pasta - very tasty - were the size of small pieces of ziti.  But there were only 5 or 6 pieces in the whole dish. Which is - quite literally - five or six bites. We also had scallops, which were a bit undercooked, there were 3, which would have been sufficient, except that they were not served with any accompaniment.  All vegetables were a la carte.  The bottom line is that to get what would be an ordinary, typical type serving like you would get in a typical type, high end, restaurant, you have to order about three dishes and sides per person.     Another part of the bottom line here is that this pretentious restaurant, with is full of itself, is far more glitz and style, and super trendy, serves good food - if not much of it - but the food isn't all that great, certainly not so great to even begin to justify their pumped up image of themselves.~David B~Carlsbad, California
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food comes for sharing and it is very good.  The portions are on the small size.  The service is great.~Donna N~Agoura Hills, California, United States
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The setting , the service, the bread and other food all high quality and delightful! Such great red kale, mushrooms , duck and venison + dessert with hazelnutds, salt caramel and rich chocolate pared with smoked milk ice cream! You get little treats too and a muffin to take home! Just know dishes are to share family style! So much fun!~bess32355~Encinitas, California
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The wife and I have been here a few times and I am always in awe at how brilliant the staff is.  The food is simple and extraordinary in its flavor complexity. I lack the words to do it justice.  I filled out a comment card complimenting the staff on our amazing experience- imagine my surprise when I received a hand written thank you card from the manager! It hangs in my kitchen to remind me what incredible experiences we've had there- and to get back in there!~James M~Los Angeles, California
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good service and excellent food. Female Maitre D takes herself a little too serious but this is LA.......Near Fox and other studios so more corporate than tourist.~p35~Ludlow, United Kingdom
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good to excellent tasting food however the concept of shared plates leaves much to be desired. The portions are small. If you were to order enough to eat the high price would not be worth the experience. Being told that this was a sharing menu for four people was a stretch. We were told we only needed two entrees. The dish of divers scallops had only three scallops on the plate for four people.The entree food was joylessly presented on the plate without any decoration or placement to enhance its appeal. All sides are ordered separately.  The caramelized gnocchi are truly miniature gnocchi, a good appetizer for one. Their Marjolaine dessert was excellent. ~Travelmaven1~New York
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very nice food, but is meant to be shared with the whole table. So if you hate sharing your food, it's not meant for you.~Brian0251~Paris, France
Craft Los Angeles~875880~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We mistakenly booked for dinner the next day but the staff seated us anyway. We had a glass of moscato d'Asti that went very well with our shared pork belly with fig and delicate sprigs of coriander. The sauce was especially delicious. We shared a main course of barramundi which we ordered with potatoes gratin. The two went very well together, and the skin of the barramundi was deliciously flavored. For dessert we shared churros with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The churros were soft and sweet. The staff were very helpful and attentive throughout. We felt the experience was exquisite from beginning to end. The price was right, considering the quality of food and wine.  It was an unexpectedly excellent value.~Staidthere~Jakarta, Indonesia
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Breakfast sandwiches are great, house made English muffins great ingredients I'm pretty sure free range eggs. Mc Donald's has nothing on this. You may wait 6 minutes but it is worth it! The pastries are delish! Very convenient from mid town Seattle . Next to the Dalia Lounge and across from Lola! Although small, no tables inside they have a few outside. But you are in Seatown eat while you explore or park it in the parks near by!~Jennifer W~Seattle
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love Dahlia Bakery. The have the best veggie breakfast sandwiches and very tasty Ham and Croissant! they are just the best bakery to get your breakfast from! I love their house made dough it comes with strawberry dipping and vanilla dipping, I have to have them at leas 3 times a week. Molly is great she always greats me with smile!~LindaMccaskey~Seattle, Washington
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love pie; all kinds. So when I heard about this supposed coconut pie that had toasted coconut and  white chocolate shavings, I just had to have a slice. I was surprised to find that I was hoping my dinner partner would decide they had had enough of their portion of this shared slice. So next time I will definitely order my own slice because we fought over those last slivers of cream on that plate. You gotta try this pie if you love pie. ~califanna348~Jacksonville, Florida
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's an incredible pie... Coconut crust . shredded coconut cream filling, swirls of fresh whipped cream, toasted coconut,  white chocolate shavings... try it by the slice.  Tom's bakers are very talented and they offer may great things at the bakery.  Enjoy!~Mark W~Seattle, United States
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Simply the best breakfast sandwich in Seattle. Excellent bread, pastries and deserts as well.  Small takeout counter so no seating.  The same baked good are what is served in all Tom Douglas restraints throughout Seattle.  Wish I lived closer.~Mark B~Seattle, Washington
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for dessert and had a difficult time choosing. So many great choices. Small place but they fit in a diverse offering.~Barb A~Canton, Ohio
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This bakery is third on the list, but it really should be number 1! We went two days in a row just to get the homemade doughnuts (really beignets!).~Laurie C~Seneca, South Carolina
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a very small bakery but big where it counts. Their quality is absolutely top notch and the Huckleberry Cream Cheese Coffee Cake was just amazing. Lots of other items available and their breads are fantastic. I don't think you could go wrong ordering anything here. So worth the visit.~tall_six6~Seattle, Washington
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This little jewel is right across the street from Hotel Andre. There is no room to eat inside but there are tables outside. The pastries , sammies , hot cereal, and cakes are to die for. All food is home made.~Linda D~Brentwood, Tennessee
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tom Douglas's Dahlia Bakery is small and Mighty.  Its main claim to fame is the Coconut Cream Pie which comes in every size - from a bite ($2) to a 9" ($36).  But everything is amazing.  I come here at least once a month (40 miles from my house) for a fix.  Breakfast sandwiches ($6 avg) are fantastic. Sweets are superb - Eclairs ($5), Caramel Apple Brioche pull apart rounds ($9), Cookies ($2), Brownies ($4) - that's just the tip of the iceberg in this walk-up that holds 4 customers at a time, max.  Round this out with great coffee and super friendly service...and I'm glad I don't live closer!  I'd gain 20 pounds!~jay s~Tacoma, Washington
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had lunch at Dahlia's Bakery, next to Dahlia's Lounge...but wish we would have had gone to the Lounge instead, as the only seats are outside. the bakery had great soup, salad and sandwiches, and the famous triple cream coconut cream pie. Awesome.~travellerfromatown~Allentown, Pennsylvania
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wherever you may go for dinner in downtown Seattle, don't go anywhere but the Dahlia Bakery for dessert!  Everything is sooooo perfect!  I'm drooling thinking about their iconic triple coconut cream pie....Heaven on a plate!!!  Lots of phenomenal choices.  Everyone will find the perfect dessert, and their coffee is great, too!  Yum....  Oh, yeah...they are open for breakfast and lunch, too.  It's not ALL about dessert. (OH YES IT IS!!!!)~migolfergirl~Seattle, Washington
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yumminess abounds at this bakery!  Not a bad goody in the bunch.  Great fig bars, the cookies are awesome as is the pumpkin bread.  It's next to the Dahlia Lounge on 4th Street. Give it a try.  ~CalicoLil~Boulder, Colorado
Dahlia Bakery~2256568~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~when I'm in town I make sure to visit here almost every morning (I stay at the Hotel Andra across the street).  the quality of the bakes is always excellent, and the coffee too.  most of all there's a really great staff!~Wetwater~Nevada City, California
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A restaurant off the New State Fairground. We went there for dinner looking for good steak, and we come to the right place.  We almost did not get a table since the place is very small and tuck in behind Best Western Hotel. This is a steakhouse but offer some seafood like lobster and clam. We were a party of four so we ordered enough varieties to try different dishes. The steaks are great and really cook to order for your specified degree. Not many restaurants do that these days. The portions are very generous also. All the servers are very professional and offer very good service. Did not miss a beat. One of the few place steak is this good. Fine dinning place so price is of course reflects that but worth it.~Qodesh~Shenzhen, China
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here at the last minute, after another restaurant was too busy. So glad we did! We were warmly welcomed, made to feel we were special guests! Although they were busy, we were immediately shown to an excellent table, and enjoyed a wonderful meal of rack of lamb and filet mignon. Also, a great "SuperTuscan" wine. We will definitely return!~NjCosmicTraveller~Sarasota, Florida
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food every time we visit.  Steaks are outstanding.  Chicken Marsala with garlic mashed potatoes is delicious.  NY style cheesecake is our favorite dessert here.   Service is attentive and friendly.  Reservations are recommended.~ADKKim~Camillus, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~From the moment you enter you are greeted with a style and grace rarely found in todays  steakhouses. From the dark wood surroundings to the highly skilled waitstaff this place envelopes you in an old world style found in Boston or Chicago eateries of days gone by. The menu is extensive with something for everyone while the prices remain in most everyones budget. Everything we ordered came out quickly, was presented well, cooked to perfection and most importantly, delicious. The wine list was limited but more than adequate. This place is very small so plan accordingly and call ahead. A little spot of heaven in a less than heaven like area.~Tim W~NH
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have never had a bad meal here.  I am a steak lover and they do not disappoint.  My favorite is the filet with the poseidon adventure topping, always cooked exactly the way I order it and the service is top notch.  Make reservations, it's a small and busy place.~11_Elisa_11~Syracuse, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I made a reservation for two at 7:30. If you've read other reviews of this restaurant, you'll note that the time of your reservation and the time you're actually seated are seemingly unrelated. We stood at the crowded bar until 8:15. The dining room is small and loud. There are many wait staff, and they know what they're doing. Our waitress was a pro(and the reason for a 2 instead of a 1 rating). A small basket of good bread arrived. The butter was infused with honey. Too sweet for dinner.We started with a shared lobster roll. Nice and buttery and a fair price. After that, it went all "down hill". My house salad had a tasty crumbly/creamy blue cheese dressing. But for some reason, they put a whole handful of chopped black olives in it. I like olives, but this was overkill. My wife's Caesar Salad had been doused with lemon. Lemon? Why? My filet mignon was served with a small side of house vegetables and risotto. The small serving of veg  didn't bother me.(If god wanted us to eat vegetables, he wouldn't have invented cows.) But the risotto was "off". I'm pretty sure they'd used lemon again. No,no,no. Both my filet and wife's strip steak were perfectly cooked and quality pieces of meat. But beware. The maitre d'butter is way heavy on the parsley. So, both these beautiful steaks were overpowered, instead of complimented, by the addition of vegetable matter.(See above about god and cows.) While consuming my entree I'd seen giant pieces of frosted carrot cake delivered to other tables. I ordered a slice, along with coffee and Drambuie, for dessert. The coffee arrived luke warm. The cake never arrived. They were sold out. A disappointing end to a disappointing meal at a price a little north of $100. I'm not sure I'll return. It almost seems as if Daniella's kitchen has some sort of guilt complex. They feel compelled to be innovative, but there's really no need to be. Their ingredients are good. It's not necessary to reinvent the wheel.~verybigv~Pennellville, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm not a big fan of steakhouses but after reading the menu on tripadvisor I saw this place was much more expansive and no $5.00 baked potato nonsense. I packed away a one pound veal chop, cooked  medium rare perfectly, with a pasta side, big salad and seasonal veg. My wife had chicken with a brie basil lube that she pronounced "outstanding". Service was very good and the place was packed when we left but it wasn't noisy at all and the live background music was pleasant. Don't let the idea that it's in a Best Western out by the fairgrounds scare you away. We really liked it a lot.~David m~Buffalo, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're expecting a fancy setting like Ruth's Chris or Morton's, this isn't the place. Daniella's is located in a corner of a Best Western, near the state fairgrounds and it's pretty unassuming from the outside. Inside, it's a cozy, small and dark room with a nice bar and I'd guess it only seats 40-50 people.  But when it comes to food and service, this place shines. The portions are large and unlike the "name-brand" steakhouses, they actually include soup or salad plus a side dish with your steak. More important, everything is extremely well prepared and tasty. The clam chowder and the lobster roll were both excellent. And while most of the steaks are USDA Choice (rather than Prime) they are still perfectly cooked and presented. And there are loads of choices for people who aren't meat-lovers.  Prices are extremely fair (ie. not mind-blowing) and the service was friendly and knowledgeable. We were here for a birthday and the birthday cake presentation was spectacular.  All in all, highly recommended.~RedstoneBoy~Toronto, Canada
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My Dad and his wife took me out for dinner here 2 weeks ago.  I got the maple glazed pork tenderloin, Dad got the rack of lamb, and his wife got the salad with chicken.  They served us hot bread with our salads.  My pork was well prepared, juicy, and tender.  Dad gave me one of his ribs and it was delicious.  I got the garlic potatoes.  They were very good with the pork.  My Dad did not want potatoes and got a double order of the seasonal vegetables.   The dress is casual.  They also have a person who comes in and sings on a couple of the nights.  He uses a keyboard and a sax.  It was nice.~Linda P~Syracuse, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I dined here for dinner. The service was slow and spotty The food was mediocre. My 14oz steak was maybe a 1/2" thick. not 14 oz. closer to a breakfast steak. They had a piano man and he was great~garie~Merino, Colorado
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Oh,my,my,my...We had discovered Daniella's shortly after its opening. We loved it!! In fact, we brought friends/family/associates  [local as well as outffo state] to savor the flavors of their various beef, veal, pork and [OMG] the lamb dishes, the scrumptious appetizers  [especially the Calamari Steak], the clean crisp salads. Oh how Charlie's wife [God rest her soul] made totally awesome desserts!! Mark and I patronized the arts, buying season tickets to the symphony, the Syracuse Stage, or Famous Artists. Daniella's was 9 times out of 10 our restaurant of choice. Wait, I take that back... it was more like 10 out of 10 times Daniella's was our evening beginning on the way to a play or a symphony! Well, then came Obama... Now it may be unfair to blame him. However, our discretionary income for the arts and dinner disappeared!  [ And Mark was working  two well paying jobs!] So our restaurant de choix as well as the performances, both of which we so enjoyed was regretfully cut from the budget!  Fast forward to 2016, we still cannot afford the finer things of culture and exquisite, no masterly, magnificent dining. However, we were "celebrating" something, or maybe  Mark had worked some OT, and we  once again were able to partake in a wonderful meal at our Daniella's! Much to our sorrow and dismay, we learned that Charlie's wife had left this earth suddenly.  Through tears, Mark and I toasted her life, expressed our sincere regrets to our friend Charlie.   The meal was as good as it EVER was!  And our favorite, Calamari steak...SUPERB! We have tickets to The Jersey Boys.... I pray we will be lucrative, solvent enough to visit Charlie and his brother [a favorite bartender!] next month (September 2016] We will be bringing a very dear friend with us!!  I would highly recommend (really???) Daniella's. Yes, it is a bit spendy; however, it is a wonderful culinary experience, Charlie and his brother, along with the other staff members, will make you feel so special, and you forget you are in a restaurant. Do the words comfortable, make you feel at home, do those words mean any thing to you?? It is worth every $$ to try Daniella's if you have never been there. If you have fallen off the train, and not been  there  in a bit, treat yourself,  you will NOT REGRET it!! For you "first-timers"you will have found a new home!!~Yili2016~Hannibal, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Quiet little restaurant. We had the shrimp scampi & the chicken Marcella. Both were delicious. Each entree came with salad & fresh warm bread. Suggest to try Pandora's box for dessert. While eating we were entertained by a nice gentleman playing the piano & saxophone. Great place. Price is worth it!!~Beamsville~Beamsville, Canada
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate at Daniella's 2 out of the 3 nights we were there attending an RV Show last month. Didn't have reservations, but we were there before 6 both times and Beth (excellent service) waited on us both nights. It was small and dark but the steaks were delicious. The 32 oz bone in ribeye was cooked med-rare as ordered. it was a little singed on the outside but as thick as it was, I didn't complain. The french onion soup was the best I've ever had.  The king size prime rib was very tender and I made several meals out of it. while I was not impressed with Syracuse itself, this little steakhouse attached to a hotel was the highlight of our stay.~Diesel_Diva2014~Dallas, TX
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We travel often to surrounding areas to try something new.   We read about Daniella's and decided to take a road trip.  We are so glad we did!!!  The service was outstanding. Thank you Kim.  The food was perfect.  All the desserts are home made and delicious.  We highly recommend this restaurant!!~Karen J~Webster, New York
Daniella's Steakhouse~545293~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~stopped for dinner after visiting hubby in hospital. Couldn't see your hand in front of your face! Had to ask for a light to see the menu. We didn't have reservations so they put us in a little corner table. felt they were crowding too many tables together hard to get around. I ordered the NY strip with mashed potatoes and a Caprese salad. I couldn't see my food hardly!! Steak was not that great had better ones at Longhorn!! Potatoes tasted instant. Salad was very good. Service was not the greatest either. My SIL left the tip I wouldn't have left as much as she did!! Our bill for two coffees, appetizer and my steak dinner came to $68. Won't be back~Bobbie A~Folkston, Georgia

Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Found an awesome variety pf glutan free foods.Everything is just mouthwatering as it comes.Highly Recommended!~Oliver Ramos  E~Pennsylvania
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I was treated to the most special evening here to celebrate my birthday.  From the moment we walked through the door, to the moment we left, we were delighted by all that we encountered.    The interior of this restaurant oozes classic French quality with attention paid to every last detail.  Although fully booked, we enjoyed a leisurely and intimate dinner at a table overlooking the central dining area.  As you would expect, the quality of the food was superb and the standard of service impeccable.  The dining staff were friendly, knowledgeable and highly skilled.  They looked after our every need but without being overbearing or intrusive.  The element of theatre and surprise was the icing on the cake.  We had the 4 Course Prix Fixe with Wine Pairing.  There was nothing that we could find fault with and would highly recommend.  We certainly hope to be able to return one day to relive this amazing experience! ~Derbyshire-Smiths~Derby, United Kingdom
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I would eat every day to that restaurant and i would never get tired of the food and the service! excellent service and amazing food expecially desserts!!~mathewtrovski~Greater London, United Kingdom
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I've been lucky enough to visit a good number of the "best" restaurants in the world and thie evening at Daniel ranks in my Top 5. From the food (fabulous flavours in the lobster, hamachi, scallops, foie gras and the wagyu) to the wine pairings, to the room and the staff, it was an amazing experience that is difficult to put into words, other than to say, it was everything a top class restaurant should be  and I absolutely recommend the scrimping and saving of pennies to afford a trip here, it is that good. ~Brian L~London, United Kingdom
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I've been to a number of top NYC restaurants and often leave there feeling it was well worth the money. The food at Daniel's was excellent, but not the best. The service was superb. They could not have been better. Maybe the best service anywhere. And the atmosphere was excellent as well. Just don't think it was worth the cost.~bruce c~Bethlehem, New Hampshire
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~It is an excellent restaurant! Even if you are used to Michelin star restaurant, you'll be very impressed. Go, and let you guide through the adventure, you can't mistake! The cooking is amazing, mixing traditional dishes with experimental cooking, service is ok, wines list is fully furnished, price is fair! Enjoy!!!~Matuche33~Bordeaux, France
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~One of the best dining experiences we've had. Seven-course prix fixe tasting menu designed by the chef to pamper the palate. Impeccable service and exquisite presentation. A place we must return to.~Gaggy1~Brooklyn, NY
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~The place is beautifull. Well appointed and one of the most amazing dinning room in New York.  Food is really good inspired by elements of the seasons. Service is amazing. Daniel Boulud is one of the most importants chefs in America .~monicalopes502~Brasilia, DF
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~This is by far the best restaurant in NYC. The food was exceptional. Everything is flawless from start to finish.~Noriko N~New York City, New York
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~This restaurant really does deliver, in terms of food, service, decor and ambience. Everything is flawless from start to finish.  I cannot thank our servers and sommeliers enough (I suppose $180 tip goes some way to expressing gratitude) but a sincere thank you is worth more than money ever can be. You were all fantastic people and I'm sure each of you will shape the restaurant industry in the future.  That 3rd star is coming this year - if it doesn't it would be a travesty.~restaurantlover19~shropshire
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Trust the chef!  Go with the tasting menu. Set aside three hours to truly enjoy the experience.  You are there to dine, not eat. It's an older feeling restaurant and could be considered pricey, but the quality is second to none and worth every penny ~Jordan L~Ontario
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We came here for my husband's 30th birthday dinner and were incredibly impressed from beginning to end. The service was excellent and the food exquisite.   We were given ample time to place our orders and were never rushed at any point during the meal. We selected the 4 course option with wine pairings which I highly recommend.  I  selected the scallop appetizer, lobster dish and finally the Wagyu beef. As for dessert, I ordered the Pomme dish. The Wagyu steak was unlike any other cut of beef I have had before - so tender that it melted in my mouth. A tiny piece of advice, as tempting as it may be, avoid the warm bread that you are given so you can save space in your stomach for all the wonderful dishes.  Every bite I took resulted in an explosion of flavors.   My husband ordered the venison tenderloin for his entree and found that it wasn't as lean as he had expected, still delicious though.   In summary, this culinary experience was incredible.~Daje2~New York City, New York
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We were travelling for business but had some spare evenings in New York and decided to visit the "big 4" being Eleven Madison Park, Daniel, Le Bernardin and Per Se in that order in 4 days. This took a fair bit of planning from australia, several months in advance and required a few late nights on the internet getting the first availability for the required date and a couple of phone calls direct to the restaurants.  Daniel had some serious competition after our first dinner being at EMP the previous night. Our reservation was for 7:30pm and the place was full of very business styled clientele and ladies in evening wear. While it was not confronting it was a complete contrast to the much more casual ambience of EMP. Daniel appeared to be a place for professional socialising as well as enjoying a dining experience. The staff were quite formal and being a table for two travellers, we immediately felt that we were being tolerated rather than welcomed. Having said that, the service was excellent although not up to the level of genuine attentiveness, for us anyway, that we had experienced at EMP.    We had the Tasting Menu with paired wines and both the food and the wines were excellent. Again, we did not feel as though we were really accepted and the server seemed to spend a considerably less amount of time explaining the dishes when compared to the table of six, obviously very important and regular diners seated next to us.  The food and the wine choices, which in fairness were quite generous in sizeand in the pour quantity, were definitely the heroes of the night and this visit could have been so much better had the engagement with staff been more accommodating and genuine.~Auswanderers~Surfers Paradise, Australia
Daniel~457808~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~we recentllly attended my niece's wedding reception at The Daniel.  The interior was so crisp and elegant.  The service was impeccable.  Each course was presented beautifully and a dining pleasure.  She had a small swing band playing appropriate background music.  The cocktail hour was plentiful with excellent appetizers.  I would highly recommend a visit to The Daniel.~angelaSouthport_Nc~southport, nc
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A must go when we are in Syracuse. I even stopped once while on a hundred miles bicycle ride because it was soooo worth the side trip! We've had a few different sandwiches and we're always blown away by the buffalo Mac that visits my dreams :) While some say it's expensive I disagree. I would rather pay a fair price for a thoughtful, hand crafted meal than $5 for franchise mediocrity. Enjoy!~minstrelmiss~Liverpool, NY
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Darwins is the best lunch spot in downtown. Popular with the office crowd, don't get there too late or you might miss out on the Buffalo Mac. Sandwiches? The meatier the better. Not a ton of eating space, so get ready to eat outside or take your meal to go.~Ben_Axelson~Liverpool, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Definitely worth a visit! I had the Vesuvio Chicken Sandwich. It may not be the biggest sandwich in the world but it was very fresh and tasty. That being said, the absolute winner was the Buffalo Mac! I am not a mac and cheese fanatic. It has to be good for me to like or recommend it, and boy was this ever good. I would go back again just for the Buffalo Mac!~sulkyracer~New York City, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dropped in about an hour before closing.  Business was still pretty steady.  I ordered the Cubano:  Virginia ham, shredded pork, swiss, dijon, mayo and pickles on a sesame seed roll.  It was excellent!  Not a huge sandwich, but filling.  As a side I had the sour cream and onion potato salad.  It was rich and creamy, the potatoes were perfectly cooked.  It was loaded with celery, onion, bacon and was perfectly seasoned.  Overall, I was very impressed and can't wait to return.  Prices were a little high, but everything is homemade and excellent, so I understand.  ~JetBlueDriver~Charlotte, North Carolina
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~For several years I worked a block away from this place.  The sandwich menu changes weekly.  All are large portions and very tasty combinations, using quality ingredients. When they offer lobster roll it is outstanding.  It is a very busy place for lunch, mostly take out, but the staff is very efficient and the wait time is minimal.  Darryl, the owner, and. crew are genuinely friendly and accommodating. They will be moving to a larger space in the near future, which will make for a better dining in experience. ~Hyfly1~Syracuse, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hands down, this is the best sandwich place in all of Syracuse. They are very inventive. The Staff is very friendly. They don't do gluten free, but they will and I am sure it would be great,~Dean O~Syracuse, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I enjoyed a delicious lunch at Darwin. Inside the restaurant is small so I would recommend take out or getting there early. The buffalo mac and cheese was lovely a well as the pot pie soup which came with a generous serving of bread. The prices were very reasonable particularly considering the food was fresh and healthy.  Parking can be tricky so get there early.~Afurcinito~Syracuse, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are heading upstate, and are anywhere close to Syracuse...  Take a tiny detour that will make you sooooooooo happy.  Darwin has an eclectic sandwich, soup and salad menu which will make you want to order one of each!  On top of the food, the staff are awesome, friendly and add to the experience.  Enjoy...~Lena A~Cortlandt Manor, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My adult son who is a lover of anything served between two slices of good bread, raves about this place.  Today he took me there for lunch.  Very busy place, only open M-F 10:30-2:30.  The line moves very quickly.  All sandwiches are made to order and the selection changes all the time I am told.   I had a cuban today.  It was perfection.  My son had a shrimp po boy and it was made with cooked to order shrimp, not shrimp that were sitting around waiting.  He devoured it, so it must have been good.  This place is mostly "to go" but we were able to grab one of the few tables on the sidewalk.~jtreby~Syracuse, New York
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The downs were that the location was a bit difficult to get to and I have celiac disease, which means no wheat or gluten. The staff was very accommodating by putting my sandwich over lettuce rather than in bread. However, they failed to tell me that the caramelized onions were floured. I had one bite and could tell but it was too late. I was very, very sick for several days, unfortunately.~cmlvngstn~Tucson
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This little hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop was one of the highlights of our trip to Syracuse. The staff was friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic about their food and restaurant. The sandwiches were amazingly good. ~barrysuttle~Marietta, Georgia
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has the best sandwiches. We usually call our order in and walk to pick it up. They service is great and the food is yummy. ~lovelife40~Orlando, Florida
Darwin~3348341~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With a menu that rotates every two weeks, there's always something new and different. Never had a sandwich that wasn't great. High quality ingredients, innovative sandwiches, amazing service. Not much room to eat in, but a must-go for lunch. ~Ryan G~Syracuse, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After 10 days of touring Hudson River valley, we were looking for another good meal and found this pizza. We had eggplant spinach and smoked mozzarella.  Pizza was excellent. Also shared a salad.  Pizza fantastic. Also bought cookies and those were also very good. Loved the people. Family recipes cooked by the family  ~debra p~Atlanta, Georgia
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Defazios has the best fresh mozzarella pizza!   Also they are so helpful as far as delivery is concerned. ..great find in the Italian district of Troy NY.~laurieg832~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Did not disappoint. ....everything it was promised to be! !! Recommend the Home made Cookies toooooo  Love. Love. Love. ~EllenHolmes67~Cape Carteret, North Carolina
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great authentic pizza.  To dine in, the restaurant is small.  Setting is very intimate and cozy.  Pizzas are on the small size.  I brought my daughter and her friend. We ordered a pizza, antipasto and garlic bread.  All of the dishes were wonderful!~Lamm612~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having grown up closer to NYC I craved a good pizza, crispy crust, nice marinara, and lots of gooey mozzarella. I found it in Troy today. Oven baked! I first ordered a pie with sausage but due to the Super Bowl, they were out. They only use fresh sausage, perhaps made next door at the Italian deli. I'll be back!~CravenMaCree~Haynersville, NY
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I heard so much about their pizza and had to try it myself.  All of those reviews were accurate. The pizza is as good if not better than described.  I plan to return for some other dishes offered on their varied menu.  ~bclooch~Albany, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was born and raised in the NYC area so I've had my share of good pizza. I'm new to Troy so am enjoying searching out good local food. So what a treat it was to find De Fazio's and this absolutely delicious pie, perfectly executed with homemade sausage, right here in Troy. Everyone told me I HAD to try De Fazio's pizza and I honestly didn't think it could live up to the hype. Well it did, and more so. I'm a fan now.   Before you die You gotta try a De Fazio pie!~John H~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was really looking forward to trying their pizza after all of the rave reviews.  So I went on their website to peruse the menu and they have a Mealeo option...so I placed my order and paid right on the site...got to the restaurant at said pick up time and it was hot fresh and delicious...ps while I was there I over heard them say 2 hour wait for pick up on Good Friday...Thank Mealeo and DeFazio's~laura p~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If we're making pizza or spaghetti at home, we have to drive down to De Fazio's to get sauce. My husband will not have it any other way. After trying it myself, I completely understand. We've tried a few of the different sauces, the stromboli, and a couple of the desserts they have in their shop and  have always been pleased. We've also eaten at their little restaurant they have next door. I'll admit the food took longer to come out then I would have liked, but they quality was spot on and the serving sizes were more then generous.~Jolene O~United States
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Imagine being thrust back in time to an Italian delicatessen complete with pancetta, hanging provolone cheese and homemade sausage topped by owner Rocco greeting you at the door. DeFazio's Wood Fired Pizzeria sits next door to the aforementioned Deli and the two are interchangeable. Yes, we found Pizza Heaven right in the heart of Troy's Little Italy.   Founded in 1951, DeFazio's still brings Mama's recipes to the table in the form of wood fired pizza complete with specialty dough's and an amazing sauce. We had the              16" Fra D'avalo pizza which combines spicy peppers and homemade sweet Italian sausage with a perfectly baked crust. Throw in a Chicken Antipasto salad and there was enough to serve three hungry people.  The food was amazing but the ambiance is what truly defines DeFazio's. From Rocco's kids behind the counter and in the kitchen, to the wait staff, all bring a level of customer attentiveness that makes you feel like you just finished the day circa 1951 and joined family and friends for dinner. DeFazio's is small and quite a bit of business goes out the door in the form of takeout or delivery but don't let the venue stop you from visiting. It is quite worth the effort.  Although we were 1400 miles away from our home in San Antonio, TX, Rocco and company made us feel as if we spent 1 hour together with long lost relatives. Thank you for taking the time to show us the business.  More importantly, we appreciate the introduction to Pizza Heaven on Earth. Who thought it would be in Troy, NY.~GoldenDomer~San Antonio, Texas
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seriously the best pizza in Troy! Wood fired, thin crust, flavorful sauce and really delicious toppings. I love the mozzabella pizza with meatballs, mozzarella and basil. The little salads are so fresh and tasty too. Excellent wine and beer selection that is paired with the food well. It is cozy inside  but can get noisy-  come early!~Beeinthestarts~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Their mozzarella pizza was the best!  We've had delivery from these guys and they're very accommodating and nice.  Would definitely order from here again.~laurieg832~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is no better pizza in the Albany - Schenectady - Troy - Saratoga area! More expensive than the Pizza Huts, Domino's, Papa Johns and other mass-produced imitation pizzas, but worth every penny. You can try DeFazio's at the outstanding Troy Farmers' Market, but a visit to their Little Italy location is worth the trip. I am a vegan and find their cheeseless Puttanesca is exceptional.Almost everyone else I eat there with is an omnivore and they love the place.~Knith~Troy, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is steps from my house, so whilst I do not have pizza often, if I want pizza this is perfect. The seating area is small, but it is fun to be in this quintessential Italian pizzeria to eat. Great choices, great crust - including wheat and gluten free - fantastic straight from the oven.~Janet D~Troy, New York, United States
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the sausage, peppers and onion on garlic herb crust. It was easily the best crust I've ever had. Cash only is a pain but it was well worth tracking down an ATM. ~smiths572~Albany, New York
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We love these kinds of places and seek them out when we travel.  Great food, caring owners, loved by the locals, neighborhood feel, and more.   The place is tiny with really great homemade food.  The salad was great, pizza, pasta too.  We were so happy to find this unique place in Troy while on a road trip to visit colleges.~sueBoston~Boston
De Fazio's Pizzeria~420254~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You wouldn't even notice this place if you walked by it! We had wood fired  pizza and the crust is to die for! The pesto pizza is amazing. We know where our regular lunch stop will be from now on on our way to Rochester. ~Marty J~East Thetford, Vermont
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As part of my visit in Utica my friends invited me to a lunch at Delmonico's. The waiter was very friendly, the food came fast and was delicious, the prices are affordable~ramsesp~Berlin, Germany
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here for an after dinner dessert and night cap.  It was debate night and the staff was very accommodating so that we could listen.  My companions and I shared a slice of cheesecake.  Can I just say that the "slice" of cheesecake was literally the size of my face!  The restaurant has a very warm, welcoming Italian feel.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere.~RRW81~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Crazy 40's themed Italian restaurant. I ordered one of the specials. Salmon with orzo. It was tasty, but super salty. Keep in mind I love salt . The wait staff was super pleasant and attentive. ~lisamatta316~Harriman, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was amazing and staff was very friendly. Prices were a little high in my opinion but the food was definitely good. It didn't take too long for our food to come out either.~BETH B~Vail, Arizona
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a whim we at dinner at Delmonico's after traveling all day. We were not disappointed. Nice ,  classy but very private and comfortable seating. the food was exceptional and plenty of it. I had the lasagna , it was very good and more than I could eat. Would definitely stop here again.~FRIPP1~Orrville, Ohio
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pleasantly surprised by everything! Top notch service, great menu, great wait staff, excellent food! The portions are huge...like, try the one pound lasagna!  Great "old world" Italian atmosphere. Surprised to find this in Utica.  I'll be back.  Bit pricy, but they do serve half portions.~Dave A~Lenexa, Kansas
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great spot for a really good meal and a special occasion.  We had a reservation but still had to wait a good 15 minutes for our table, which was surprising since it was a rather early Saturday night time slot (6 pm). Okay, so the gangster-style servers are a bit "cheesy" and the micro minis and textured tights on the female servers sorta reminded us of a "chain-type restaurant costume", we quickly moved past our skepticism and had a wonderful time.  But seriously, the get-ups" have got to go!! We had calamari and Caesar salad to start.  Filet Mignon and chicken and the house special of filet Mignon medallions with fettuccine.  Top it off with a cannoli which was shared by the 5 of us and well...stick a fork in all of us ... we are done!!   We even had leftovers.   Portions are very generous and the pricing was very good considering the quantity and quality of the food. Definitely will return!~Ellesor826~Parrish, Florida
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is part of a small chain but feels more like a neighborhood institution.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Prices were extremely reasonable and the food was delicious. We're we're there on a busy Friday night and the energy was high. A little bit loud but very friendly and inviting.  We'll definitely return if we're staying in Utica. ~rogerd168~Toronto, Canada
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is just a treat for all the senses. From the moment you walk in to the sounds of Lou Monte until the last bite of their phenomenal meatballs you're treated to best experience in dining you will know. Yeah the cards on the ceiling are from a magician, but somehow it screams Rat Pack ( a room you can reserve). The service was super spot on - the martini was glacier cold and the whole evening was incredible. Best calamari I've ever had by the way. Thanks! Just the ticket after a 4 hour drive in the rain .~Michael C~Monroe, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was very nice. Our server was a real sweetheart. My husband and I ordered the same  Filet Minon with fries and onions.  We ordered ours medium well and it came back well done. :\ Needless to say they were very tough and not seasoned all that well. But overall with a little salt and pepper that I added myself it was good.   I definitely recommend this place.~GUNTHER9~Ozone Park, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant really reminds me of the restaurants of old. Nicely furnished, lots of rich decor, rich menu, music playing, football games in tv, loud with birthdays and big groups. Wine and beer on tap were top quality. They don't make accommodations for dieters though. The portions are huge and very well prepared. The pasta dishes have rich sauces. The guys with me cleared their plates of steak and ravioli. For me, being on a perpetual diet, it was really a struggle since I truly wanted to eat my entire serving of shrimp scampi but knew my body really shouldn't. No room for dessert after that. The atmosphere is lively so visiting with a friend we hadn't seen in awhile was difficult since we couldn't hear each other well.~Nancy C~Cancun, Mexico
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed Delmonico's so much when we stopped in for a beer during happy hour that we came back the next day for a mid day lunch.  Service was prompt and pleasant and our food was good, the stuffed hot peppers were really interesting and not your typical menu offering.   The atmosphere is the Frank Sinatra, Tony Soprano  Italian vibe with caricature pictures and a lot of booths.  ~PeggyH2000~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped to eat dinner and we were not disappointed.  The service and food was excellent.  We had beef medallions with Alfredo pasta and the chicken franchaise lemon chicken both were delicious.  My only complaint is the portion was large way more than i can eat in one setting.  If we were not traveling i would have taken home both leftover dishes.  ~Sue  K~Mesquite, Texas
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying at the Best Western next door and went to Delmonico's for dinner on their recommendation.  It was a truly amazing experience. I had the Filet Portabella with garlic mash and the steak was cooked to perfection ( medium rare). My wife chose the shrimp scampi which she reported as being extremely good.  The Blue Moon beers that we had were suitably cold and a good match for our generously portioned meal.  The decor was suitably rat pack style and the service excellent (We sat at the bar).  $89 plus tip.  Highly recommended.~planbee~on the move
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever I'm in Utica I eat here. Filling Italian meals, consistent, . Nothing extraordinary, nothing bad! Frank Sinatra music with the photos and Italian sayings. Always busy. Sitting at the bar is nice. Stay away from rest room tables, too much traffic and "Happy Birthday to you" starts there!~kpdance~ny
Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse~479743~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Within walking distance of our hotel, this restaurant provided us a delicious meal. The menu had so many tempting dishes we wish we had had the appetite to try, but as it was late, we were looking for something lighter. I had a perfect Italian soup and a salad of fresh mozzarella cheese, Roma tomatoes, and basil drizzled with Balsamic vinaigrette. My husband had a very generous antipasto salad. Our meals were just right and very good for what we wanted. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and efficient. ~MI_Bookbinder~Fenton, Michigan
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delmonicos is a go to place for business for a great steak or other foods.  The service on this night for our small party was disappointing.  Our waiter told us he was bored when we arrived.  Even though he seemed pleasant and had a smile on his face, he couldn't be bothered to refill our water, on a hot night. He was not attentive to our needs and the food took an unusually long time to get to us.  However the food was great when we got it.  To say the portions are generous, is an understatement.  We will be back but I will put them on notice next time - DON'T IGNORE YOUR TABLES!~JohnCAPWN~Binghamton, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Do not be fooled by the previous reviews. Delmonico's is not worthy of a 4-5 star rating. While it may be one of the best places in Syracuse, that does not mean it is exceptional by any means. I completely agree with @NorthernNJTraveller that this establishment charges way too much for mediocre Italian food. The steaks are advertised as gigantic but were minuscule in reality. The appetizers were cold and the pasta was barely cooked, complete with bland tomato sauce straight from a can. The "side" of penne that came with the steak entrees was extremely small and customers were charged $3 extra to substitute with a potato. Like I said, there aren't a lot of options in Syracuse, but you're better off saving some money and driving to the mall instead.~MsCollinka~New York City, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and large menu selection. Expect to wait before getting a table because they are always busy! Desserts are wonderful as well.~Karin W~Syracuse, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a business dinner here. Food was outstanding and the service was beyond compare from start to finish. We ordered several appetizers, entrees and desserts. Everything was delicious.~Wendy V~Shiocton, Wisconsin
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our first time to eat at Delmonico's, celebrating our anniversary while traveling.  We called ahead for seating, and when we arrived the place was packed, but they seated us right away.   The atmosphere was very cool with caricatures of famous Italians and other such celebrities on the walls.  The server was Liz and she was fantastic.  The Delmonico Steak was unbelievably good and my wife's Filet was excellent as well.  Perfectly cooked, with a side of Penne Marinara with a nice sharp sauce.  We were stuffed but we had to try the Tiramisu so glad we did.  Everything from the atmosphere, to the service, to the food was absolutely perfect.  The place was incredibly busy but we were treated as if we were the only customers there...just perfect.  When the bill came I was pleasantly surprised that is was much lower than I had anticipated, but that was just a bonus.  Fine dining at a mid range price!~john v~Greenwood, Arkansas
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So lets start with the food. The ingredients appear fresh and well selected. The flavors were average with some better than average. The presentation could use some work as a few of the plates had food on the edges. The selections were flavorful overall with a hint of corporate kitchenesque which was a surprise. The service was definately sub standard there were staff everywhere yet we sat with empty glasses and were not checked on for extended periods. There is an obvious lack of any real teamwork. Not impressed overall.~nunya n~New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food here is fantastic and they have a great atmosphere for family gatherings! Well worth it! Also, the staff there is very organized and friendly. Other restaurants need to take notes from here! They go well out of their way to make sure your experience pleasant. Favorite restaurant  in the Syracuse area by far. ~ECW11077~Manlius, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Waitress was fantastic!  Food was good.  Was really enjoying the salad with homemade dressing when my meal came out half way through...that was a little disappointing.  Tell them to slow it down if you want to sit and enjoy your meal.  Otherwise, it was worth the trip.~Lisa T~Chester, Connecticut
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wanted an Italian dinner so went to our go to place in Syracuse.  Delmonico's has a great menu, super service, atmosphere to boot and very good Italian foid.  The shrimp cocktail was very good and a nice horseradish sauce.  Linguine and clams was perfect.  The ravioli were huge and very good.  We will return.  ~Jerry Z~Camillus, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was convenient to my hotel, Plenty of items to choose from.  Steak was huge portion and tasted great.   The wine pours generous, not like some restaurants where you get less than half a glass.   Will go again when I visit Syracuse.~Theresa W~Binghamton
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We celebrated our anniversary by eating at Delmonico Italian Steakhouse.   I ordered the 24 oz Delmonico Steak and it was tender and delicious. This was probably one of the best steaks I have had. Since we had a refrigerator in our hotel room, I had the leftover steak the next day. My wife had the lobster and it was also great. We shared the steak and lobster and a salad. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Because it was our anniversary the restaurant served us  connoli that was excellent. It was a nice gesture. The restaurant is  a very welcoming place. It is known for its wall caricatures of famous celebrities. In the parking lot there is a parking spot reserved for Jim Boeheim, coach of Syracuse's Men's Basketball Team. If in Syracuse, head for Delmonico's! If it is good enough for Jim, it is good enough for you!~Clark V~Raleigh, North Carolina
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went here for a dinner during a weekend visit to see our SU student.  The waitress was attentive after a wait on a Saturday night.  Five of us got beef and it was cooked perfectly for each of us.  We ended with dessert which included a cannoli-  very generous and Oneida the better fillings I have ever tasted.  We will definitely be back.~steveb11200~North Potomac, Maryland
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went last week with family from out of town. We all got something and shared, it was very good. A little expensive but the steak was very good. Italian food, pasta and meatballs were great. Service was non stop!~Thomas T~Syracuse, New York
Delmonico's Italian Steak~421544~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we were sat in a small private area.  Waiter was amazing and very attentive. Steaks were hooked to perfection and we never felt rushed.  Atmosphere was great, music just loud enough to hear but did not interfere with our conversations.  Will be back when in the area again.~Judith A~Cortlandt Manor, New York, United States
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As with most of the breweries in the area, if you try to go on a Friday or Saturday night the wait is long. The food is really good, and the beer is good as well. It's not cheap but I'd comparable to other restaurants in the area. ~Sarah J~Beaverton, Oregon
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ate and drank here 3 times during my recent visit, and I was never disappointed. Huge crowds and long waits on a Saturday afternoon, but the other times, we were quickly seated.  The food was always excellent. I had the elk burger, ham burger (yup, with ham), and the pulled pork sandwich. All were great.  The beer quality goes without saying, especially those brewed right there and not available anywhere else.  If you go, go early, beat the crowds and linger for a while.~LHerrmann~Oceanside, California, United States
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beer is terrific-we also had food and were not as impressed. Would totally visit again, but would stick with the beer.~Nancy A~Cary,Illinois
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everyone told me to check this place out, and I wasn't impressed. The wait is long because everyone wants to eat there, and then my friend and I both got sick after eating here. There are many other better breweries to check out.~TXDG~Ripon, California
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like their beer but this place is just overcrowded, loud and not a great experience. It feels more like a tourist trap...I'd try other spots over this if I had to do it again.~KsueP~San Francisco, California
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I met a former colleague from overseas who now lives in Portland and this is THE PLACE for lunch that he took me and my fiancee.  WOW!  The place was packed on a holiday Monday (Columbus Day) but we only had to wait 10 minutes so we started with their craft beers and were thrilled to find they had Scottish red ale.  Delicious.  And the sandwiches and burgers looked amazing so I chose an elk burger - that's right, elk!  After all, it is the Pacific Northwest!  The food was delicious, beers thirst quenching, service friendly and efficient and the interior decor was so frontier-like - lots of totem poles, wood carvings, loved everything about the place!~TomTerrific51~Arlington, Virginia
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went here for the beer mainly but was pleasantly surprised by the food. There was about a 30 min wait (Wednesday evening around 7:30PM) but we headed for the bar (packed) and ordered a couple beers to enjoy while we waited. One disappointment was that they don't sell pitchers of beer. When we got to our table we ordered the Pork Wing appetizer which I thought were amazing and for our main courses we ordered the Mushroom burger, the Chicken and waffle and the Mac & Cheese with Chicken.Everybody loved their food and I would definitely consider going back.~annathorell~San Jose, CA
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are seeking good steaks and food in Portland - there are many places to choose from. This is one place  where you can't go wrong - steaks, fish - whatever you order - it will be good. Enjoy. ~Guy B~Maccabim-Re'ut, null, Israel
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's nice to see a place that's really popular on a Sunday evening, a Tuesday evening, and a Thursday evening.  We went on a Sunday night and had a 40 minute wait, and from what I can tell, after walking past this place several more evenings, that's probably average. Friendly service, and the beer is really good.... not sure if we'd go for dinner again (food is ok, but not as good as the beer). But, we would definitely visit again, and maybe try something else off the menu.  If nothing else, we'd have a few beers and an appetizer.~Naberius~Chicago, Illinois
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Often pubs have good beer and okay food. Deschutes has great beer and great food, perhaps some of the best pub food I've had. The crab roll was fresh and delicious, and my companions' food was equally as good. The selection of beer is impressive, including a number not found outside of the pub. The space is very comfortable as well, and you're only a block from Powell's Books.  Highly recommended.~wuppertaler~Washington
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in at lunchtime for a quick beer and snack. Staff were very accomodating that we didnt have a lot of time even though it was busy. Beer was really good, i had the peach beer was very fruity and interesting and we shared the cheese and salami board was really nice especially the pickles! Pate mousse was also tasty. ~Mel M~Sydney
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in on Halloween and thought the place would be jammed.  We were advised by the staff that things were generally a little slow as most folks were going to parties and as such we were able to get seating and quickly served.  We had stopped in for a beer which we know to be great based on past experience, but we ended up with fries and a giant pretzel with a warm cream cheese/Cheddar dip surrounded by stone ground mustard.  Complemented the beer perfectly (some stouts and Porters).  The place is well appointed, clean and the service staff is efficient and knowledgeable.  Our waitperson was a joy and made the experience all the better.~WilsyPV~Penn Valley, California
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed the food - flavorful mac and cheese and yummy veggie burger. But, the 6 small beer flight was the highlight. They have a few suggested flight choices or you can build your own.  Nice atmosphere and friendly service.     Fun Portland stop!~MickDidi~Eagan, Minnesota
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Deschutes Brewery after a graduation to celebrate with a large group but have been there also just for a regular dinner.  Four our celebration they accommodated our large group easily and made us feel very much welcome. The food was excellent, and there is a good choice for different tastes.~Kathy H~Portland, Oregon
Deschutes Brewery~1061696~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Deschutes for dinner and it didn't disappoint.  The beer is amazing and they have beer on tap that you can only get at there pubs.  The clams, Big pretzel and cheese, and the meat and cheese board were all great starters.  The Crab Roll was fantastic.  Lots of Dungeness Crab.~Mike S~Springfield, Missouri
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beautiful atmosphere. Excellent servers. Bar tender made a great martini. Will definitely be back! Loved it.~Elizabeth G~New York City, New York
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Deuxave did not disappoint.  Reviews were right on.  Food selection was very good, and presentation was well worth the walk from downtown.  The duck was exceptional and the fish dish that evening also good.  Decent portions, not too much and not a finger plate either.  Desert and coffee also were memorable.  Service first class.~Bobby B~Weston, Florida
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fabulous food and great, attentive service from a very knowledgable team. Smoked confit duck leg to start accompanied by a seasonal kale salad, loin of lamb main course was just perfect, the only downside - no room for dessert! Fantastic wine list, my choice of an Oregon Pinot Noir was delicious. A perfect celebration location. ~Tony A~Reading, United Kingdom
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having passed Deuxave many times and admiring the twinkling outdoor lights and beautiful big windows, I was excited to finally step inside!  I was not disappointed!  It's extremely cozy and warm, a bit rustic, yet contemporary. Just lovely!  Our server was pleasant and well informed, without being overly involved.The food portions were perfect and in no way skimpy.  The presentation was beautiful.  We each ordered something different with the intention of sharing, but, in the end, we each loved our choices so much that we didn't want to share! We will most definitely be back!~finerthings2~Warren, New Jersey
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend visited me this weekend and I took her to Deuxave for dinner. They have an abundant choices of starters and entrees. We went for the lobster gnocchi and duck confit for starters and both were delicious. My friend had the scallop for main course and I had the duck breast which for me is never a bad choice. Will definitely come back with friends.~Jessica Y~Shanghai, China
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Third time, and three is a charm: great restaurant for the most satisfiying, rich, yummy food in a contemporary elegant atmosphere with low ambient noise, great to have a conversation at a table of four, nobody has to scream. Perfect brioche and house-churned butter, appetizer of duck confit is fantastic, so is beef tartare, foie gras and lobster. For main courses we had chicken parmiagiana - excellent - and a pasta carbonara that easily beat the best we had in Rome - just creamier and more interesting with the raw quail egg yolks on top to be mixed in and roasted sweet corn. Very light ile flottante for dessert, more flavors than substance, and nice brownie. About $330 for 3 people including a bottle of wine, drinks, and desserts. If you like rich satisfying dishes, this is the restaurant I recommend above all others in Boston or Cambridge.~Anna M~Cambridge
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a special occasion restaurant.  It receives top marks in all areas: food, wine, service, decor and ambiance.  It is beautiful in an understated, quiet way: high ceilings, spacious seating, a lovely stone fireplace with a roaring fire, large windows, tiny lights, low lighting.  It is romantic and elegant.  The service matches: very professional, friendly, unobtrusive, knowledgeable.  The food is fantastic.  I had the Long Island Duckling and it was the best duck I've ever had.  The brioche bread tastes more l like croissant it is so light.  The deserts are light and ethereal.  Portions are good sized but not heavy at all.   This is food that is to be savored for its taste.  All is artfully presented.  It is expensive, but worth it.  Truly a memorable experience that left us in a good mood.~Dutch Brother~Boston, Massachusetts
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Upper class service and food makes it a great destination for a romantic dinner. We took the five course chef's dinner and almost everything was perfect(desert was just OK). Overall, a great experience, great atmosphere and a nice evening out.~S h~Marlborough, Massachusetts
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a family dinner for four last week at Deuxave. The food was excellent I had the halibut as did my wife . Our daughter had the steak which she also thought was excellent. Our server was very friendly and of great help. He and my daughter had a great conversation regarding our wine selection. Pricey but worth the coast~jas43048~Columbia City, Indiana
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a fantastic experience at Deuxave.  The restaurant has an excellent corner location on Commonwealth, and has outdoor dining.  The dining room is elegant but not pretentious.  The food is superb, and the service exceptional and well-paced for a relaxing dinner.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and knew each menu item thoroughly which helped us decide what to order.  We were not disappointed.  Don't miss the desserts, which are incredible.  In particular, the presentation of the Lady Ann Vacherin was amazing in a meringue shell, and it was also delicious.~EdW502~Lake Bluff, Illinois
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a perfectly nice time at Deuxave for a romantic dinner out.  The wine list is both exs: extensive and expensive.  Our wedge salads were small and expensive but quite tasty.  The meat sauce pasta was classically prepared and while very rich it was also very tasty.  The fish was fresh but the sauce was a strange mix of bland and over-spiced.  You never knew which fork full would be disappointing or shockingly bitter.  I never send food back but I almost (and should have) with the halibut. The dessert was light pretty and interesting.  The waiter refused to let us pay with perfectly fine gift cards for no particular reason.  Might be back but wouldn't rush.~GoIndians~Boston
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have dined here on several occasions, and each one has been special.  The service is excellent, as is the food preparation, presentation and quality.  Starting with the amuse bouche, to the salads and the entrees.  All were outstanding.  Pricing has increased, so this is not the place to go on a budget.  With a medium-priced wine, figure $100 each (without dessert or coffee).~David P~Boston, Massachusetts
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked to Deuxave after a Friday afternoon BSO concert.  The weather was lovely so we wandered through the Prudential Center on the way and stopped for a draft ale at Bar Boulud.   It has been several years since we had visited the Pru area and clearly fashions have changed.   When we arrived at Deuxave we were graciously seated and the staff was very cordial.  We decided on sharing an excellent bottle of wine--Mongrana 2012 Agricola Querciabella.  For dinner my husband enjoyed the Bolognaise Tortellini and I had the special which featured chicken.  In general the experience was delightful but it was pricy and the atmosphere colder than we expected.   We are not looking forward to a return.~RetiredonCapeCod~Sandwich, Massachusetts
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When we pulled up to the curb at Deuxave my first thought was that it reminded me of a chic restaurant that one would see in Paris, with an inviting and romantic air about it. To our delight, the service was impeccable and the food superb. An innovative blend of French cuisine and the best of local and regional ingredients, artfully and tastefully prepared, we found the menu to be enticing from top to bottom. My favorites were the seared Hudson Valley food gras, the 9-hour French onion soup, the harvest wedge salad and the spices crusted tuna & togarashi fried rock shrimp. And as one might expect, the wine list is extensive and artfully curated.  If one wishes to have a thoroughly enjoyable evening at a fine establishment in Boston, you cannot go wrong here. I know one thing for sure: we will be back soon. ~cdoggett001~Boston, Massachusetts
Deuxave~1907605~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~superlative dining experience, every aspect of the evening was perfectly executed. valet parking staff was helpful. reception/hosting team was gracious. decor and ambiance was inviting, refined, comfortable. the creative cocktails well executed. waiter was friendly, helpful, well trained. small menu with varied and interesting choices. each item had refined flavors and preparations. starter bread (peppered brioche) was light, flaky and yeasty. apps were marvelous, with refined and balanced flavors (onion soup, carapaccio, lobster!). entrees were packed with flavor - pasta bolognese, halibut and tuna. after eating these, we wanted to order everything on the menu. i imagine that the tasting menus effectively offer this option. the waiter recommended a relatively inexpensive $50- bottle of french burgundy, flavorful and balanced. kitchen has a delicate hand, is wonderfully inspired and has a delightful imagination. the desserts were marvelous. each plate was delicate, flavorful and reasonably portioned, so you could enjoy the entire meal without feeling over-filled. the end of evening coffee was smooth and light, and as a final treat an unexpected dessert-inspired amuse-bouche was perfect. couldnt ask for more or better. the entire staff and the chef are to be commended. for those whose reviews complained about the 'high' prices, the entrees are in the $30-$45 range, not any more expensive than other higher end restaurants, and the quality makes it worth every penny. on a final note, the french (duck) fries were delightfully crispy and flavorful - one order is enough for the table to share.~Perspectech~boston, ma, usa
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~All the UCLA students know about this place and after checking it out you will immediately understand why. There is always a line out the door that moves quickly. The quality is there and the prices seem like they are stuck in the 80's. Everyone is in a good mood and Westwood as a whole is very clean. Parking can be an issue if you search for street parking but don't even bother, just find a parking garage and enjoy walking around the area. You will not be disappointed. Plus for $5 you can treat a date and yourself.~ThisIsYourMother~Los Angeles, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As if the line was not a good enough reason to check this place out. The pricing is just something straight from the 1990s era (or so i've heard). No where in a big city will you be able to buy a dozen cookies for such a good price. Show two dollars (no tax!) to them and they'll slap your choice of ice cream in between any two cookies. It's not original, but they're doing it right. That is all you need in the time where every street has something new going on. The only minor complaint that I have is that they do not make their own ice cream, but that's a very small issue... imagine how long the line will be if they made their own. I'd probably have to make an online reservation at that point to get an ice cream sandwich :)~BRIAN T~New York City, New York
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Awesome! Choose your favorite homemade cookies and ice cream flavor and you get a custom-made ice cream sandwich for just $2! My favorite was the double chocolate chip with peanut butter cup ice cream. First two hours of parking is free in the city parking garage and there was no line on a weekday afternoon.~TNbeachbum75~Clarksville, Tennessee
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Didi Riese has the absolute best cookies around--the constant line is proof!  You might think you'd have to pay up for these gems, but they are the best deal around.  These are a sure hit to bring with you for any event--people in LA always appreciate a box from Didi!~robertwE8806LW~Los Angeles, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fast food delight...watch your ice cream sandwich being assembled and making choices of your favorite cookies and ice cream combinations....nice!~TarzanaLiz6634~Tarzana
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hot cookies, your choice of ice cream and a line almost any time of day. However, it's worth the wait under the iconic red sign for their signature ice cream sandwich. FYI, they only take cash.~Allison M~Los Angeles, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been coming here for more than 22 years.  I love this place.  You get good cookies at a fair price.  Always a line so plan to be there for a while.  This place is worth the wait.  Besides the cookies and ice cream,  Although they sell hot dogs, and other things I  have not really had anything else.  This is not a high end place.  I definitely recommend.~msmxtoo~Bakersfield, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have given ... and gotten ... these cookies for hostess gifts and Christmas gifts for years! They are always fresh and delicious. The lines are sometimes long ( but you can order for pickup(!) but they are worth the wait, they are simply the BEST! ~warrencat~Los Angeles, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Others have described the atmosphere, the menu, how it works, and the lines of people due to its popularity, so I won't repeat this.  If you like cookies and ice cream sandwiches, this place is a must!  You can customize your order and it is a fabulous value, too!  What is not to like?  Park in a public lot and walk.~Tovya~Tiburon, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our daughter is so lucky to be at UCLA & have places like this to get a treat. Ice cream sandwiches for $2 with fresh baked cookies & Dreyer's Ice cream. So many possible combinations with the cookie & ice cream flavor options.  They have brownies too you can make into a sundae. Also have shaved ice with tons of flavor choices. Staff is quick which helps with the long lines. It's a popular spot in Westwood and fun with family or friends. Cash only so be prepared.~TheVez5~Manteca, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service is great, the cookies are reasonably priced, and the line is long but moves pretty quickly but the cookies are worth the wait!!!~Tiffany G~Los Angeles, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is a reason the line is always down the block. Great variety of ice cream and cookie choices. When you put them together it is pure heaven! And it won't break the bank!~DebB818~Los Angeles, California
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is not really a restaurant, it is cookie heaven.  I ordered 10 dozen Friday afternoon, picked them up 8:00 am Saturday.  Served them as dessert at a picnic Saturday afternoon.  My guests devoured them.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I gave it to them.  Pick up the phone, dial...~LAJan2013~Los Angeles, CA
Diddy Riese Cookies~832888~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a must when in Westwood!  It's just one of those places that is extremely hyped up and really does live up the expectation, sometimes things are popular for well deserved reasons!  Considering it's fame, the line to get into Diddy Riese was indeed out the door and down the street.  But don't fret.  Despite the long look of it, it moved at a nice pace, and it took no more than ten minutes before I was ordering.  The best part about this place, I think, would be it's dirt cheap prices.  Where else in Los Angeles in 2016 are you going to find $2 ice cream sandwiches?!  The ice cream was good, nothing spectacular, but still a tasty treat.  They were well worth the experience of going and the dirt cheap prices!~Parker G~Los Angeles, California

Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beautiful spot. Lounge below the restaurant for pre and post dinner cocktails.   Nice reception. Lobster bisque is very rich. Heart attack inducing rich. Chopped salad was terrific. Sea bass was really nice. Arctic char special was on point  Two complaints. Portion sizes were huge. And I am a cancer survivor and wear a pork pie style hat. Was asked to remove it due to "policy". Harrumph. ~Cdnskier~Toronto, Canada
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! The views are out of this world and the food was phenomenal! It can be kind of pricy so if you are on a budget I suggest just getting apps! The shrimp ravioli and the green chili hummus were to die for! They bring bread to the table to start with 3 types of butter/sauce (strawberry maple, goat cheese/olive oil, 3 pepper). The bread/spreads was honestly so delicious I will dream about it, especially the goat cheese one. The entrees are actually pretty big but not too much where you are overly full. I suggest getting there right at 5 to enjoy the sunset. Absolutely love this place and will be frequenting when in town. ~MichelleMurphy123~Chicago, Illinois
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a client from out of town stay at the property then we had a meeting over dinner at dpov.

Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The view here is amazing.  No wonder it was voted the best "mountain top" restaurant in the US.   The food was also amazing!  We had the lobster and it was done to perfection.  Appetizers were ok but did not bowl us over.  For desert we had the creme brulee and it was very good.  Service was over the top and we felt both welcome and appreciated.   The only negative I can make over the whole evening was that I made reservations over 6 weeks out for a window table with a view.  When we got there we were told you had to stay at the hotel to get a window table.  Very disappointing as later in the evening those tables actually sat empty.~jorge g~Potsdam, New York
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is restaurant perfection!  You could go there for just the specacular view. However the food and the service are equally astounding. You won't be disappointed.~Travel4fun728~Phoenix, Arizona
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thoroughly enjoyed the setting, and the staff were friendly and professional. I had the Rock Fish (special) and it was good. The lobster stock was great (lots of umami going on). However both the fish and the accompanying shrimp were overcooked. That should not happen at this place/these prices.~TBoneStockholm~Stockholm
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came during restaurant week and just loved it.  It is our favorite restaurant in the whole valley.  The food is always excellent, Bob our server couldn't have been better, and  not to mention the fabulous view.~Vicki D~Surprise, Arizona
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been to this place 4 or 5 times over as many years, and have never been disappointed. Even though we don't stay at the hotel anymore, we always make time for an evening here.. This time, an early November evening, timed to coincide with sunset. We sat outside on the terrace with delicious cocktails and with the fire pit lit, and enjoyed the view, the warmth, the coloured skies. Then we were shown to our table indoors, as Phoenix lit up in the dark. And oh my goodness: we chose the taster menu and were spoilt as course after course of amazing platefuls came to us, with wine specially chosen by our waiter, Richard. We had one set of taster wines between us - and it was a very generous serving divided between the two glasses each time.  The food was stupendous - from the duck to the dessert. What a feast! What a treat!~PJaneS~Bath, United Kingdom
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We made a reservation to coincide with sunset. Our server, Robert, recommended wonderful dishes for our kids -- both budding foodies -- to try. They loved everything! After a long day, Robert was kind to send us back to our room with a to-go bag of delicious dessert. Such a lovely evening!~raleighdecker~Western Springs, Illinois
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying here for 5 nights so I booked two nights on open table. The first night the terrace was a private event so we were seated early for dinner, the waiter an older guy was a bit miserable. The food was very good.  The second night we had drinks on the terrace served by Marguerite excellent. Then in the restaurant a window seat, fantastic, full moon as well. We had Richard as a waiter he was excellent, funny, personable and professional. The guy who bought our food was so funny but we didn't get his name.  The food was excellent and as it was restaurant week it was three courses for $44 and it was worth every penny. The chopped romaine salad was excellent, I had steak fantastic, my friend the pork but the highlight of her plate the cous cous. Desert was also delicious I had tres strawberry and my friend chocolate orange, all the better for the excellent desert wine Sauternes.  I wish this restaurant was local but we live in the UK. ~186400Caroline~Warwick, United Kingdom
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for date night during restaurant week, the menu offered was great- the appetizers, mains, and desserts were all tasty! The view was beautiful- especially at sunset.~Kristen C~Phoenix
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to the Lounge for dinner. Sat outside with a spectacular view of the city and all the way to the airport, was awesome. Highly recommend. Good selection of beer and wine, food is mainly appetizers. I had a charcuterie plate and some truffle fries. Really had a great time.~mrmark~Edmonton, Canada
Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort~1074029~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a disappointment. Only reason for going is the view. Food was bad. Over done chicken and burnt palenta pork was too rare and requested it medium well. No manger came by no one asked how dinner was. Did not feel valued.~ralph b~Chesterfield, Missouri
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After reading about this restaurant we were excited to satisfy our cravings for soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao). Though 20 miles from our hotel we knew it would be worth it based on all of the reviews.  Have to say we were a bit disappointed. The dumplings were well made, good texture and consistent in size; however, they did not have much flavor.  The green beans and the cucumber dish were good.  The shrimp and pork steamed dumplings were also ok. Perhaps if we had not had the dumplings before we would have thought they were great but comparing these to others (Slanted Door in San Fran, Imperial Lamian in Chicago, Shanghai Cafe in NYC) they left us disappointed.   It was cool to watch them make the dumplings through the window front of the restaurant.  ~Joy G~Durham, North Carolina
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Both places have a great process, product and people. You will never see this place empty because it is simply that good. If you have not tried Dim Sum go experience it soon. You won't regret it at Din Tai Fung!!!~Jay C~Charlotte, North Carolina
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Din Tai Fung is a really good place to grab dumplings, noodles, and buns, but be careful what time you go or else you're in for a long wait. Try to hit it for lunch or early/late dinners to avoid waits of up to an hour during prime dinner hours. Great place for kids as they love the Pork Buns and all different types of dumplings and noodles. We'll definitely go back, but will be selective to only go during off hours.~GuinnessGus~Bellevue, WA
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Getting to fulfill my craving for Din Tai Fung was the top of my list when I confirmed my work trip to Seattle.  Having had DTF in Taipei, I had mixed feelings on whether an American location would live up to my expectation of the soup dumplings.  It definitely did!  Even at 9pm when closing is at 10pm, there was still a brief wait of 20 mins.  Grabbed a seat at the bar instead for no wait and had great service.  Over ordered food and surprised to see the quality of the to-go food boxes.  As with the ones I've been in Taiwan, there's a window to watch the dumplings being made.  Nothing is amiss on details and consistency despite location.  Being a traveler, also appreciated the location of this one being in the University Village center with great variety of stores and shopping.~bluehalo11~Houston, Texas
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Got sooooo full.  So many things to try, I just wish they had a way to order smaller portions.  Go with many friends and try lots of stuff.   ~astaplet82~Dallas, Texas
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had dinner here with some friends during my stay in Seattle, and it was great! It's very cheap and we ate a lot, even if we had to wait a bit to be seated as it was crowded that night. However, the staff was so kind, and so the waiters. They serve fabulous desserts too! ~Carolina B~Perugia, Italy
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just don't understand the obsession for this place by so many people. It's possible that I just don't like XLB that much. Our group ordered the pork & crab XLB (2*), the  shrimp fried rice (4*), the  shrimp & pork dumplings (3*), the sauteed string beans w/garlic (4*), the shrimp & pork wontons w/spicy sauce (4*), and the shaved ice (3*).~liquidmj~Seattle, Washington
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Incredible sauteed green beans, unique pot stickers, delicious chicken fried noodle dish, shrimp fried rice, very special tea drinks and the amazing dumplings made our lunch here a memorable experience. We arrived prior to the opening time and were glad we did since the entire restaurant filled up very quickly. We enjoyed our few minute wait until the restaurant opened watching the dumplings being made as we stood in line looking through the window. I heartily recommend this restaurant and will return when I visit the Seattle/Bellevue area again.~Judy T~Marble Falls, Texas
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our party of four traveled from downtown to eat at this restaurant located adjacent to the UW campus primarily due to the very high ratings and great reviews it had received.  We entered with too great expectations and were rather disappointed.  We were seated almost immediately although there was a large lunch crowd present.  We had a table for six so there was plenty of room at the table but the crowded seating made things awkward and we had to essentially sit as two groups of two. Our waiter did a wonderful job explaining the menu and the history of the chain.   We sampled much of the menu and it is a large menu.  The pork soup dumplings and steamed fish dumplings were the best items we tasted although the flavor was somewhat bland and they quickly cooled making them inedible.  The fried rice was left in the bowl and the buns were the worst thing I have tasted since I was in Chinatown in San Francisco.  The spicy sauce was not.  Overall, we wanted to really love this spot but the food let us down.  It is a vibrant location that attracts students and University employees but I would not travel from downtown again.~55135Traveler~Kingsport, Tennessee
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Simply the best dumplings. As good as I've had in Din Tai Fung restaurants in Asia. Good service and fast. Just note it does get very busy so go early or go late or be prepared to wait~Davos8n8~Melbourne, Australia
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tripadvisor reviews are spot on. Great dim sum, service was quick, and if you have to wait to be seated, you can watch them create the delicious dumplings by hand with their efficient culinary artistry in the glassed in kitchen. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food. This is my new favorite for dim sum, and will definitely return next time I visit Seattle.~thefeetdoc~Edmonton
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wait was very long, recommend making reservations.We had dumplings, shangai rice cakes with chicken and sweet taro buns. Good. Portions are small. We don't eat pork, so missed out on the best options. We enjoyed sitting at the bar. Also try natural ice cream (molly moon's) downstairs. Both places have long waiting lines. ~hoydenishilps~Seattle, Washington
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived lunchtime and there was a small queue but this wasn't a problem as the queue moved quickly, allowing us to view how the noodles were made through the large windows.   The vegetable and pork wonton soup is very good and so are the dumplings, my favorite the shrimp and pork dumplings. The sauteed mustard greens with ginger has a tasty and refreshing flavor. We were served within 5 minutes and I can recommend this eatery.~Tom K~Sydney, Australia
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had heard great reviews about Din Tai Fung and absolutely enjoyed the food and great dining room. Watch chefs prepare the dim sum through a picture window as you enter the restaurant. The staff was friendly and guided us through the amazing range of unfamiliar choices. We shall return for another outstanding meal.~VashonRR~Vashon, Washington
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We started to with Braised beef noodle soup and hot and sour soup.  They were both delicious and plentiful .  the Medium bowl is large enough for two and the large is enough for 4 people.  We ordered Shrimp and Pork wonton in spicy sauce which also was really good and then came the Soup Dumplings.   That's not what they are on the menu, but they are a dumpling with pork and liquid hot soup inside. A real treat.  This place is always busy, but its worth the wait.~Denver7889~Queenstown, Maryland
Din Tai Fung~6413321~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Worth every penny. Food and service were excellent. Staff was ready to answer any questions about and provide any help that might be requested. ~Bryan W~Leesville, Louisiana
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived with a group of tour operators as guests of this restaurant. The portion of food they provided was very little, however, what there was of it was tasty. The staff were young not seeming to be very caring nor knowledgeable of what was going on~GeraldineLady~St. Catharines, Canada
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like BBQ ribs, chicken, and southern side dishes, this place is the best in Syracuse!! Its usually packed to prepare to wait for a table and to be served!~Adrian L~Cicero
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just visited this great restaurant/bar on 10/27/16. Our food was outstanding and our waitress was excellent. It's on the small side and definitely has a bar feel. The band was good and the cocktails were top notch. Can't wait to go back next time we are in Syracuse. ~jen t~Zanesville, Ohio
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The original one  The food is great. I recommend brisket, turkey, or pulled pork.  Never had a bad experience here. Large demand so plan to get in early or to wait ~The_Traveling_Ben~Syracuse, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place usually has a wait, so use their takeout service and you get all the good stuff without having to hang around for a table. The pork sandwiches are very good with a decent amount of meat and nice, chewy buns. The sauce is excellent, tangy and sweet. The brisket is also a winner. They have a nice selection of sides and the collard greens and the tomato/cucumber salad stand out, along with the mashed potatoes. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the meats here, they do a really good job.~RYC88~Centreville, Virginia
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was terrific and the food was amazing. Dino never disappoints. There is something on the menu for everyone and they always play great tunes!~Mc21blue~Mendham, New Jersey
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The wait during Syracuse's Family weekend was two hours so we ordered to go. The ordering and pick up process was pretty easy although parking was tough (no dedicated To Go parking). The BBQ was good but not terrific. The sides were similar, good to very good but not immensely memorable. I was torn between three and four but given how much good BBQ is out there, I decided on three. Maybe this is the best in Syracuse but overall, it is only OK.  I would note that BBQ seems to be intensely personal so if you think this is an 5-star joint, good on you.~5Psi~Centreville, Virginia
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a must try when in Syracuse. The food is fabulous. There's live music I believe nightly.  Great for drinks or to go with family. In the summer there's outdoor seating and live music.~stang555~DeWitt, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This my shortest restaurant review. Simply delicious, friendly staff and nice comfortable atmosphere. Enjoy!~JGLINY~New York City, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was recommended by a friend and now we recommend it to everyone else!  It has a unique atmosphere and feel.  The tables are quite close together but you don't even notice because you are so focused on the amazing food.  All the food we tried was exceptional.  They also offer an extensive beer menu and I recommend the beer flight so you can try four different beers!   I highly recommend you go to this place!~Lisa L~Franklin, Minnesota
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were driving from New York  City to Syracuse.  Along the way we had a couple of people recommend this place, so naturally we stopped.  It's a busy and loud place.  We had about a half hour wait, which wasn't bad. The service is great and so is the food.  There were four of us and we all ordered something different.  No complaints about anything.  I personally had the ribs and brisket. Fantastic.  The only thing that was mediocre was the Bloody Mary that I had while waiting for our table.~rauschs4~Spokane, Washington
Dinosaur Bar-B-Que~421559~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~best ribs: good size, great taste. would compete with Bar-B-Barn in Montreal for the food and ambiance. went there on a Monday afternoon and fair crowd. chicken,chicken wings also available. easy to park. not too far from the carousel mall.~belanger99~Ottawa, Canada
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After several years of waiting (around 7-8), my wife and I finally had lunch at Dinosaur in Troy. She had a brisket sandwich and I had a Cuban sandwich. Both were well made, tasty and had good flavor. Mine was good, but not quite up to the standards of a true Cuban from down in Florida. The side dishes were interesting though. I had BBQ fried rice and cole slaw and my wife had the slaw and mac and cheese. The slaw was solid in that it was mildly creamy and not too sweet. The fried rice was awesome as it was real fried rice but had bbq meats in it and a nice flavor. The mac and cheese was well made but had an odd taste due to the use of a cajun seasoning, according to our very perky waitress. Service was excellent, bathrooms were clean and the whole place had a nice rustic feel, but couldn't capture the genuine shabbiness of the original building Syracuse. However, the view of the river was fantastic; much nicer than downtown Syracuse. Overall, the place was solid though I will say some prices seemed a tad high to me. But then BBQ joints, at east in NYS tend to be on the higher side in our experience.~Mseinber~Altamont, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best Dinosaur bbq sauce I've ever tasted! I loved it so much, I bought 2 bottles with our visit. They were excellent over ribs. Their corn bread and mashed potatoes were great! They gave my son a student discount when he showed them his RPI student ID. I was not thrilled with the bathroom though. Needs updating and a good cleaning. ~S R~Troy, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinosaur BBQ is a chain, with decent BBQ and great service.  The BBQ is pretty much what you expect, but the flavors are surprisingly good.  The waitstaff at this DBBQ were very attentive and quick to make sure you're happy.~iTravel242~Ramsey, New Jersey
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First visit to this location, been to the one in Harlem. The fried green tomatoes were delish as usual. Dinners were alright. The restaurant smelled a little too smoky..Needs a refresh. The service was good once she showed up and a little slow considering they were fairly empty. My biggest complaint was the Sangria which was probably the worst I've ever had. Tasted like water with fruit and a couple tablespoons of wine, gross. So discussed I drank water.~dowdross~Scarsdal
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great service and food; friendly, attentive to specific requests; good for all in the family; we will come back~cheekago~Chicago, Illinois
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can see why this restaurant was always mentioned as a great place to eat in Troy!  We had the friendliest servers, great beer choices and we were AMAZED by the BBQ.  In the midwest we have our Kansas City BBQ,  Memphis BBQ and ST Louis BBQ , but this BBQ almost made the pig cry for joy!!  Well done,  well done!!~75barbaraleo~O'Fallon, Missouri
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like the Dinosaur, but it doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be when I would stop by at the Syracuse location.  I don't know if the food is better in Syracuse or BBQ food is something you get tired of.  That said, this is one of the best BBQ food that I have had in the area.  BBQ Chicken sandwich is good and I like the combo meals too because you get a little of ribs and chicken.  The baked beans are the best I have ever had.  Mashed potatoes are good too.  Not a great place for vegetarians.~steveredler~Delmar, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family (2 adults, 2 teens) visited the Dinosaur BBQ last Monday, 9/26 and only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated, which was very welcome.  We ordered two sets of wings:  one BBQ, one Wango Tango.  Both were delicious, cooked perfectly, and the sauces tasted just as we had hoped.  Daughter had the mac and cheese and found it a bit spicy.  Husband tried it and agreed, although he liked it. I had ribs and they were delcious, fall-off-the-bone.  Son had chicken sandwich and enjoyed it.  My husband had a plate of a little bit of everything and especially enjoyed the brisket.    My only negative was the outside of the building.  The landscaping was so overgrown and distracted from the entrance.  I like rustic, but this was unkempt.~debandrob0821~Albany, NY
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friends and I went there after reading the good reviews on TripAdvisor. However, it was a bit disappointing. The food was okay and sizes were moderate. The service was okay as well, but it took them quite long to bring the dishes. ~gloriavallfor~Troy, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice restaurant right on the water in Troy not far from RPI. Great rustic look and family friendly. Food is very good. Excellent bbq. Thought it was a little pricey for college students but reasonable for families. Although they do offer platter type servings that would be good for a group to share.  My daughter had the ribs and she said they were very good, green beans side too. I had bar b san chicken with side of chili, both were very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place.  It also had its own parking lot which is rare in downtown Troy. Service was very good. Food came out quick and was hot.~DCfromCT~Southbury, Connecticut
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for lunch after visiting our RPI student.  Great food - awesome and different sides!  Love the maple brown suger sweet potato and the fried green tomato.  Watch for bees in the Spring/Summer when seated outside - ALSO be careful not to drop your credit card when seated outside.  An unlucky patron drop his card, and it went right through the slates of the floor!~Michele D~Fair Lawn, New Jersey
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant was very busy on this Sunday evening.  We had a window seat near the river for a nice view.  Because of the crowd, the noise was deafening--not a place for a quiet, intimate dinner.  My chicken sandwich was on the chewy side.  Since we were a party of two not ordering drinks, the server seemed to ignore us in favor of those who would generate a larger check and tip.~Rock1774~Willow Street
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is one of the favorites places for people from Troy and other near communities. As you enter the restaurant you are welcomed by a wooden style furniture that creates a great athmosphere with walls, floor, ceilings and tables made from wood. We were sit quickly and service was prompt and friendly. The food is really good: The best ribs and bbq sauce I have ever tasted. Highly recommended!~lcastill3~Panama City, Panama
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Travelling thru Troy, looked on Trip Advisor, rated #1 9in the area and rightly so, brisket and ribs, my wife had chicken and pork, friends had nearly the same. Great food, cooked just right, the side were awesome. The beer selection good, the service was wonderful. Nice decor, nice presentation, clean and comfortable. I would return if we lived in the area, we don't, we were traveling from NH to Michigan.~Bob W~South Lyon, Michigan, United States
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a meal here on a Thursday night. We were sit quickly and served just as quickly. Service was quickly, accurate and friendly. Our server was taking care of the tab at the table next to us. they had kids and she entertained them and talked to them about their first day of school while dad took care of the bill and mom was busy with a little one. She went out of her way to make everybody feel welcome (sorry forgot her name) Food was amazing as usual and I would make a detour again if/when I go back that way.~Germain1000~Orillia, Canada
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to this location for dinner on Sunday, quite busy since it was the long weekend. Food better than Service As with all Dinosaur, the brisket is the best choice. the ribs are second. The housemade sausage could use more seasoning. The chicken is just ok. Do yourself a favor and avoid the fried rice. Great french fries, though. Food took forever to arrive, almost completely cold meats, but fries and rice were hot. Guess poor coordination in the kitchen.~Juan C~New York City, New York, USA
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While I am not a big fan of restaurant chains in general, trying Dinosaur BBQ for the first time I was impressed with the food quality.  The fried green tomatoes were tasty but they did need the dipping sauce, more seasoning in the breading would help here. The pulled pork and the brisket were both good, flavorful on their own without having to drown them in sauce. The sauces were ok but nothing special, mixing them proved to give the best flavor. Service was fast and friendly even if it was the "fake orgasm" friendly approach which I think is a bit over the top but some corporate playbook somewhere has instructed wait staff to sit down with you and make chit chat as if you're old high school buddies, there's nothing offensive about it, it's just not needed in my opinion. Overall I was very happy we gave this place a try and we would go back again if we were in the neighborhood.~optiman32~Hopewell, New York
Dinosaur Bar-B-que~2093018~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the food was really good and the price for this area was great also. I was born and raised here so coming home to different restaurants and eating good food is exciting I enjoyed this place but service needs to be fixed. They kind of ignore you unless you order drinks. That needs to be changed. Your biggest tips are not from drinkers it is from the families. Lesson learned..~heather654~newark, ohio
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~But I would not mind meeting the pastry chef from Do Rite donuts. Old fashioned donuts are the best, in my opinion.   Do Rite, I love you. Call me. ~Ruth P~chicago, United States
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious donuts. We sampled many flavours and we liked the cream cheese the best. They also have gluten free and vegan doughnuts. Coffee is average. Earlier in the day the better tasting they will be! ~spunkygonecountry~Australia
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have never actually been in the store before but I have a friend that will bring me a vegan donut every time I see her since she lives nearby.  I have had the blueberry (ok), the strawberry or was it raspberry (very good), and last night I got a chai maple donut.  The chai maple donut was THE BEST DARN vegan donut I have ever had.  I wish she would have bought me 12.  Regular donuts were brought for everyone else and my husband said those were the best donuts that he has ever had.  Yum Yum Yum!~SnewpeaB~Illinois
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love donuts and these were to die for! Best donut I've ever had. I tried the cheese danish donut and my boyfriend had the buttermilk old fashioned, both great choices. The restaurant itself is a small place with a decent amount of seats but great for a quick bite. The chicken sandwiches were also amazing! Highly highly recommend trying this spot.~Natalia A~Vancouverstaymonth=5
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I search out local donuts in every city I visit. Do-Rite are the best I have found, and the girl who sings behind the counter makes the experience that much better! A couple of my favorites are the carrot cake with cream cheese and the sourcream old-fashioned. Everything is good! A couple weeks ago, my boyfriend walked to Do-Rite as my daughter and I were running in the RunMagMile half marathon. We wanted to know Do-Rite would be waiting for us at the finish line!~cbtravels124~Lexington, Kentucky
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I would never guess that Do-Rite's gluten free donuts are gluten free. The texture and flavors are spot on.   The small batches do run out (they are made at a different location), so if you want the widest selection, arrive by 9 am. For instance, today instead of having the pistachio with Meyer lemon topping, I had to console myself with a chocolate glazed. And the shop will close before the posted 2pm if they sell out of donuts.   The donuts, which are big are about $3, but the Dark Matter coffee is only $1, so for $4, you get a nice snack. And it's coffee only, no other beverages.  There is no seating, so plan to nip into your office with your treat or to the shopping mall that is kitty corner.~AhhMaa~Chicago, Illinois
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are a fan of donuts, this is the place to go.  Buttermilk donuts are the best I've ever had, and carrot cake donuts a close second.  Favorites go quick - they have everything early and stay open until they sell out.  If you are picky you want to get there before 9 for the best selection.  No real place to stay and eat in (they are limited to a couple of small tables outside), and frequently a line, but well worth it.~Christi C~Chicago, Illinois
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Some of the best raised donuts I've had.  Love the chocolate glazed and vanilla bean glazed.  They run out of choices so you may not get your top choice depending on time of day, but they were wonderful.  Service is friendly and efficient.~mpcSF~San Francisco, California
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Their GF donuts are giant and cakey.  I love the chocolate frosted ones.  FYI they are big enough to share.  Coffee is just OK, but donuts are great.  (I know they are pricey, but you can't find GF donuts anywhere, much less good ones)~Kelly L~Chicago, Illinois
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~These are the best donuts - I'm not vegan or gluten free, but I've tried some of those offerings here and they're all really good.~LanaChristine~Chicago, Illinois
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an easy place to pass up, but fortunately, my sister in law lives nearby.  She didn't realize it was a donut shop until some co-workers pointed it out.  The Do-Rite is small - hard to get into and out of, but the donuts are amazing.  We restrained ourselves and only got 2.  Pistachio and buttermilk.  These folks know how to make good donuts and they look like they are having fun!  Their coffee is wonderful, too.  I will absolutely come here every time I'm in Chicago.~suehitn~Knoxville Tennessee
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We grabbed 3 donuts....pumpkin overload, old fashion with cinnamon topping and a double chocolate old fashion. Each was packed with flavor, the right texture and perfectly moist. One of the better donuts I've had. A bit on the expensive side but this is no average donut! ~blumenla101~Boise, Idaho ~ Providence, Rhode Island
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stayed in downtown Chicago and came upon this place by chance.  It honestly was one of the best doughnuts I have ever had-  so fresh, soft and the perfect mix of flavor!  We tried the baked cinnamon glazed and vanilla glazed.  I can't wait to go back and try more.  ~akkrn1979~Oshkosh, Wisconsin
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here in the afternoon. We had 2 donuts. Both were very flavorful in a good way, but both were a little dense to our liking. We loved the location and the charm of the place and have heard great things about the location so...we would try it again! Make sure to have some photo fun with the giant donut!~Michelle K~Wisconsin
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried 6 different donuts. We especially loved the original old fashioned donuts. There was a line way out of the door when we got there, but the service was fast and friendly. ~JoyBulldog~Orlando, Florida
Do - Rite Donuts & Coffee~3162980~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~great donuts for the price.  tasty and fresh and the counter help get your order right ALL the time unlike at Stans.~aaleon00~Chicago, Illinois
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another place to add to the healthy eating List.  Food war great.  I had the margherita pizza and the others had wok bowls with different protein selections.  Highly recommend the Internal Affairs drink (even though I don't like jalapenos).  Jordan K was our server and he took very good care of us.  Most definitely on the return to list when in the area.  Pricing was good and portions were nice sized.~plgetz~Waynesville, Missouri
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delightful surprise to find just half a block from the Marriott Downtown. I had a Wok Bowl friends had Turkey burger, pulled pork, stake frit, Cobb salad and drinks. Everything is fresh and cooked on the spot. Flavor was outstanding. A hidden gem for sure. One person in our party did not receive her food until much later. Server was most apologetic and the manager came over as well. Service was amazing!!!~Paula M~Brussels, Wisconsin
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Doc B's is conveniently located right off N. Michigan Ave. It's a small place with an industrial vibe. My friend ordered a pizza that was absolutely delicious, and I had what was quite possibly the best veggie burger I've ever eaten, and I'm a vegetarian! The sweet potato fries were fabulous too. Prices were reasonable, and the menu was varied and interesting. Service was great too. Would definitely recommend!~Debra N~Lenexa, Kansas
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good lunch menu with a wide selection of beers. Even has vegan options for the dinner dictator in your life. ~widowson510~Cleveland, Ohio
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great atmosphere, there is no doubt one of the best restaurant in Chicago! Try kobb salad or wok bowl u will like it for sure. By the way reserve them ahead because they are too busy all the time!~Bahaka~Chicago, Illinois
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I loved my work bowl with salmon and Thai sauce. Portions were generous and service was amazing. The fun cocktails were an added bonus. ~Teacher30~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was waiting for my husband to get done with a meeting so I found myself at Doc Bs for a small dinner. I sat at the bar and the bartender couldn't have been nicer. I ordered the drink, Crazy Beautiful, which has vodka, elderflower, sparkling wine and is topped with a dry hibiscus. Since I had been walking around Chicago for the last 6 hours, beautiful wasn't how I felt but I could relate to crazy! The drink was perfect and pretty. I ordered the seared tuna ap which came with a kale salad...perfect for a light dinner. This is a great place to stop at. The food is fresh and tasty. ~kkjellin2016~Orange County, California
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for healthy AND tasty, look no further. All in our party ordered their dinner bowl which included a blend of vegetables (stir fried) along with choice of stir fry sauce, meat, chicken, salmon or shrimp. Great place!~SRT95~Indianapolis
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Interesting selection of good beers and ahi tuna appetizer seemed like they went together.  They don't tell you that a kale salad goes with the tuna.  Good for people who like kale.  Not so good for those of us that don't. Nevertheless, great tuna/beer combo  The lobster roll was their special and I agree it was special.  Especially good! Quieter than average place No reservation was needed when I was there.  ~skiNebraska~Kearney, Nebraska
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service staff was very friendly and double checked to confirm whether certain things were vegetarian, which should have been indicated on menu. That is a drawback, as it would simplify ordering, despite the kitchen being accommodating and making alterations to dishes. Best sweet potato fries. ~Kulbi~Thornhill, Canada
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The staff are soooo warm & accommodating; the food organic & delicious! What is outstanding is the fact that the chef offered half of our consumption 'on the house' coz our meals took too long to be served - organic restaurant with excellent manners? Unbeatable! ~Elizabeth L~Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very friendly and helpful staff. Great menu. Portions absolutely enormous - the Danish ribs are about a foot and a half long!~Michael P~Perth and Kinross, United Kingdom
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good menu with lots of choices. Great for a group with children. We had the wok out bowl which was very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their choices. Great service too.~AuroraMom~Aurora, Illinois
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in to Doc B's for a drink on Saturday and had a few lovely cocktails.  One had fresh flowers and the other one was a classic Martini.  We did no order food so I can't comment on that.  Our server was great, very friendly.  The decor is kind of weird.  I'm not sure if it wants to be a bistro, a diner, a sports bar or a swanky place to get s drink.  We were there in the middle of the day on Friday so may be the atmosphere changes  at night.  Overall pleasant stop.~RebeccaWCarmel~Carmel
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying at the Knickerbocker Hotel and decided to go out for lunch nearby. We were pleasantly surprised by this cozy spot. We ordered the guacamole and sweet potato chips as an appetizer....WOW. I had a Wok Bowl and my friend had a burger, and neither one of us was disappointed. ALl the food had a fresh and appealing look to it (my mouth is watering as I remember it). Our server was outstanding and super knowledgeable regarding the menu. Cocktails were also wonderful.~Yeukai M~Cape Town, South Africa
Doc B's Fresh Kitchen~4988288~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~first time - my pick was between the Wok and noodle salad. Went with The Wok and it was excellent. Chow mein noodles, loads of fresh veggies and the sauce was spicy thai. My partner had a corned beef sandwich and sweet potato fries. Excellent place for lunch.~BigDogWillie~Fort Worth
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good donuts but not crazy outstanding. Had a few varieties and thought they were ok. Maybe if I went in and looked myself to pick I would find something better. However, wasn't that impressed with texture of dough. ~angm212~Chicago
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good donuts but really don't know what the fuss is about. I saw 20 people outside last weekend.  I don't think I'd stand in line for them. ~Walt3~Chicago, Illinois
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great donuts!  The line starts early and gets long but it's worth it.  You will see leaving with boxes of donuts.  Anybody that knows someone that is going to the Doughnut Vaults adds to the order.~michaelchicag0~Chicago, Illinois
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I buy doughnuts from their food truck parked on LaSalle and Adams in the morning.  Their doughnuts are the best I've found in Chicago.  No one comes close.  Their buttermilk and coconut cream and toasted almond are my favorites.~LarryVetter~Chicago, Illinois
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Line starts early and doesn't stop until they are sold out!  Get there early and you will be rewarded with some of the best tasting donuts in Chicago!  Coffee is pretty good too! ~Jim T~Chicago, Illinois
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Looking for great doughnuts in Chicago you need to look no further.  Locally owned hole in the wall that serves doughnuts until they run out each day.  Expect to wait in line but it moves quickly.  Get there early if you want the fritters or seasonal specials. ~marchuk~Minnesota
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Read lots of great reviews about this place and knew to get up and arrive early.  Considering how busy this place is the line-ups aren't that bad, less than 10 minutes, and the line remained about the same the entire time we were there (about an hour).    What a quaint little hole in the wall place.  Love what they've done with it!  We got greedy and ordered 6 doughnuts since we were just visiting and were only going to be to this place once, so we wanted to try as much as possible.  These doughnuts are HUGE!!! We thought we could maybe eat 2 each and it was almost impossible to finish the 2nd one each, let alone the last 2 that we had to pack up and carry with us for the rest of the day because we couldn't eat another bite for hours.  The jelly-filled (raspberry) were by far the best doughnuts I've ever had (similar style dough to Krispy Kreme).  The buttermilk old-fashioned was a deliciously heavy cake style doughnut.  We got the daily special which was some sort of strawberry doughnut (another heavy cake style) with a chocolate glaze which was also great.  We also got a chestnut glazed, and some other glazed (thinking walnut....), both were also great and in the Krispy Kreme style dough.  The person serving was amazing at providing suggestions as well!  Best Doughnuts EVER!  And $1 for a coffee - can't beat it!  And all the water you can drink.  Show up early, be prepared to wait, and don't let your eyes fool your stomach - probably 1-2/person is more than enough!  No need to let the rest go to waste by going stale in your cupboard for a day.  Worth the wait!~Pamela M~Toronto, Canada
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~SO. GOOD. Worth waiting in the rain for. The coffee is fine, but the doughnuts are so good. Get an original buttermilk. If they have it, get a wedding cake doughnut. I regret not trying the gingerbread... I regret not getting one of everything... YUM. ~Jana D~Austin, Texas
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The donuts here are always top quality and so fresh.  You can't go wrong with any of their old fashioned varieties, but  I especially love the pistachio. They also have an amazing blueberry doughnut and apple fritter.  BTW, they are huge so make sure you get some knives to cut them up and share all the flavors.~PLPeanut~Chicago, Illinois
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is our favorite spot for doughnuts. There's a line always at the Canal location so that's the bummer part. But, the end result is worth the wait.  Always a line when they first open up...we try to time it a little after (45 minutes) hoping they still have the triple chocolate ones left and a shorter line. Once they're out...they're gone. These doughnuts are light, airy, fluffy....and huge!  They do have some cake doughnuts that are more like an old fashioned type, which are equally good, but my girls and I prefer the fluffy ones. If you are out and about, you may run into their donut vault and can also enjoy their selection. That wads nice treat after a random dinner with friends from out of town....dessert on the go!  Don't pass up the chance to try it...you won't regret it!~kimchi77~Chicago, Illinois
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This small cute place is really good. While on vacation I like to go to doughnut shops and this is one of the tops. I recommend just a plain vanilla glazed. And the portion is huge! But not too heavy.  It is super small inside operated by one guy, everyone should go.  Would I recommend going? Yes! If you have one doughnut in Chicago, it has to be from here. ~concon55~Vancouver, Canada
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our first visit to the Doughnut Vault. When we first arrived and saw the long line...we were unsure about waiting. Luckily we were with a local who ensured us that it was well worth the wait. For being a big around the corner line, we only waited 15 minutes. It's cute little Window and blue door in the brick was charming and with no other sign or advertising that we saw...I could have easily been missed. Inside was so small. Vault is right. The area you walk into and order from was like a short hallway. It was so unique and full of character. Seriously cool. There were a few more options than what was on the sign. The donuts were amazing! The buttermilk and coffee creme were our favorites!!! A great little spot for some amazing donuts! I dont know how I will ever eat store bought donuts again. ~Michelle K~Wisconsin
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited with my sister as we biked all around Chicago. Very small inside but the doughnuts were big and had great flavors. We had the Gingerbread stack, Pistachio glazed, and our favorite the Maple Whiskey Pecan Old-fashioned. No line when we visited at 10 am on a Monday. Definitely will be back when in Chicago ~btyson11~Mishawaka, Indiana
Doughnut Vault~2302509~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Worth the trip just for donuts. We end up with about 1/2 dozen donuts for just two people because we always want to try a variety of flavored. Coconut were my favorite.~Allnightahgurl~Chicago, Illinois
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Big taste and big prices.   My steak was very good. The service was top notch and the ambiance was incredible.  You could picture Dean or Frank sitting in the corner booth. The prices were on the high side. The steak and lobster combo meal drops in at over $200. ~Robert S~Mattoon, Illinois
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Durants is one of the top three resturants in the Phoenix area. Service is supurb, cuzine is exquite and atmosphere is enjoyable. You enter through the kitchen, so you have a chance to say hello to the chefs and see what is the day's special. I dine at Durants whenever I'm within 100 miles of Phoenix. Try it !!~Bvd R~Tucson, Arizona
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~During our business trips, we always try to find an old supper-club-style steakhouse for at least one of our meals. Reminiscent of years past where the waiters wear black ties, the seats are vinyl, and the steak is just a giant hunk of wonderfully cooked tender beef. This place fits the bill and then some. The atmosphere is great and the food is even better. A nice touch that harkens back to the old days is being able to enter directly through the kitchen. A unique dining experience that shouldn't be missed.~vietti~Overland Park, Kansas
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had been going there for years, but moved away.  While visiting, I made sure I got back.  Durant's is in a class all by it's self.  The food is outstanding, the adult beverages are powerful and huge, and the service is world class.  This is old Phoenix, elegant and classy.  Eating at Durant's is not just a meal, it is an experience.~ROBERT B~Bellingham, Washington
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been here twice now and have left feeling the same both times...underwhelmed. The service is very good and friendly. While the food is good it just doesn't blow me away. With so many steak house options in the valley I don't think I'd return. They do pour a darn good dirty martini though. If your looking for local history this is place to go. Walking through the kitchen brings back that old school vibe. ~will c~Phoenix, Arizona
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been going there since I was about 11. My parents loved the owner & the place. If you want a great meal in a old school place right out of the movies try it. We used to see sports stars there at times but don't know about these days. A little expensive for many families. ~Bennie R~Peoria, Arizona
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I only eat steak once or twice a year and this was the best ever.  I never order it out because no one ever gets it done enough for me. This was no problem here. They butterflied the filet and it was cooked to perfection and extremely tender. The bread is to die for and the sides are delicious. Don't miss this one!! ~jilcc~Hagerstown, Maryland
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was staying around the corner on a business trip and used the advice of others to direct me to Durant's. It has great staff who look after you and recommend dishes but I felt the steak was just ok and not quite what I was expecting for the price. I would have thought it would have been more tender with more complicated tastes than it was for the quite high cost.~rww1979~Warwick, United Kingdom
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was taken to this restaurant to celebrate my 87th birthday on October 3rd. The food was exceptional!!!! IT IS DINING AT ITS FINEST!!! My steak was cooked to perfection and the Mushrooms were delicious and plentiful!! (I am salivating just thinking about it.)  Ron, our Waiter, was great!!!  He was attentive; very personable and knowledgeable of all Menu items.~MileHighFox~Colorado
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It is an institution. It was founded in 1950. You enter through the kitchen and there are no windows, however, it has a nice atmosphere.~StanUSA2014~Sellin, Germany
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Start by entering through back door into the kitchen. You could use the front door but what fun is that? Greeted nicely by well seasoned staff just like their steaks, well seasoned. That's a joke you can laugh now:-) Anyway, party of 4 started with cocktails and apps in lovely red tuck and rolled red leather  booths. Love the crushed red velvet wallpaper too. Blast from the past. I had a Hendricks Gin Gibson and it was fabulous, probably the best Gin Gibson I've ever had. This is a steak house per se they do have other entrees but go for the beef. I had an 18oz Ribeye grilled and seasoned to perfection. We had a splendid dining experience at Durants and they even arranged a cab out for us.  Loosen up your purse strings you won't be disappointed! ~JuanRCabrillo~Eugene, Oregon
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is very old school in terms of decor, but that's charming in it's own way. The service was very good and in-hurried. The shrimp bisque was nice as a small starter. Then came the steaks. We had been out all day and so were quite hungry. My "house" steak was medium-rare and excellent. My colleagues had filet mignon and a NY strip - both very good. Sorbet, ice cream and cobbler to finish. Wine by the glass was OK. It's not a cheap place, but it is worth the money. ~IOWman~Switzerland
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were very pleased with Durant's old world charm. It felt like a place my grandfather might have taken us 50 years ago. The flocked red decor was old school but clearly well maintained and spotless. My steak was perfection, my wife's lamb chops mouth watering. All soup, salad, sides and deserts were presented as they classically should be prepared. The "long pour" of bourbon was generous as were the wine pours. Our waiter (Greg) was a gentleman and served us with the kind of friendly formality lost in today's chic hot spots. We called a pedal cab to return us to our hotel, ending a perfect fall evening in great thanks for our good fortune in having imbibed at Durant's.~John L~Prescott, Arizona
Durant's~335366~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You really do go back in time when you visit Durant's. We went for lunch last week. It was as much a visual experience as it was a lunch. After entering through the kitchen and being greeted by the kitchen staff, you are guided to the dining room which, as you might expect at a speakeasy - dark and ornate, dark red velvet flocked wallpaper and dark, red leather baguette booths.  Almost sinister! The service was attentive but not cloying. Our server, Jeff, was very pleasant and gave us time to relax and enjoy our libations before ordering. The food was very good, albeit a bit pricy. I had "the Italian" sandwich. It was great! I took half of it home. Hubby had the Patty Melt and he ate the WHOLE THING, something he rarely does. We hadn't been to Durant's in a very long time but we will return again very soon. Hoe to see you there!~Joan B~Scottsdale, Arizona
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Booked table here for Saturday night, and got a nice boot with a good view to the live music and the bar. Really nice ambiance in the restaurant.  Unfortunately forgot the name of our waiter, but she was lovely, and made good recommendations The lobster tacos was just amazing! We had one to share for two persons.  For mains I had the seabas while my friend had scallops - both very tasty. Again, too large potions... should have had some sides to the fish, but had no room for it! For desert she told us that the portions were large, so had to share. We went for the chocolate cake. Jummy!~GroINorway~Norway
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Busy restaurant with lots of atmosphere ! Starters were great but highlight was steak - the best I've ever had ! Can't wait to return  ~roisinr9~Belfast, United Kingdom
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Come here and enjoy really, really good fish and sea food! The menue included several excellent fish dishes with sword fish and sea bass as our favourites. Pair them with very tasty sides, and an excellent wine from the broad wine list. Its not cheap, but considering the verygood quality food and service its actually very good value for money!~sandbypag~Gothenburg, Sweden
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Eddie V is an upscale restaurant, with focus on seafood, but with good meat options. The decor is modern and stylish and the atmosphere intimate. Expect top notch service and flawlessly prepared food. Recommended for a special dinner or business entertainment.~Michael-Traveller-JP~Dusseldorf, Germany
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Eddie V's was the best. Andrea was a blast to have as our waitress. Definitely Will be going back. The food is great, the ambiance is great, drinks are good and strong!~takemeonatrip65~Atlanta, Georgia
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food and excellent service. Reservation for busy Saturday night was honored on time.  But the background piped-in music is very loud. The people shouting to be heard above the music raised the noise level. Kind server did lower the music twice but other servers raised the volume. It is a good restaurant but I would not return.~09Raleigh~Raleigh, North Carolina
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great bartenders & wait staff! Enjoyed the Cub's game from a bar table with excellent food. Scallops were delish as was the butterfish!~MisHDChick~Fond du Lac, Wisconsin
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great seafood and Great Steaks! We love dining in the lounge with the live music. Incredible crab cakes, best in the city! Even the seafood salad is great. A couple side dishes worth mentioning are crab fried rice (Order w/o the heat) and the au gratin cheddar potatoes. For dessert Bananas Foster presentation is showy, AND worth the indulgence! Service is friendly and knowledgeable not only with the menu, but also with the wine selection. A side note is that the kitchen is most accommodating with requests of no spice or on the side.  Eddie V's is our fav go to restaurant for a delicious relaxing dinner.~CINDRINI~Kiawah Island, SC
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My daughter and I ate here, we hadn't booked and took a chance on a Wednesday night. The service was outstanding and the food excellent. The atmosphere was comfortable with live but not obtrusive music making the whole experience a quite special.~debbyhughes~North Wales, United Kingdom
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice decor. Lobster tacos were a great appetizer, one for each of us. My filet medallions with crab were excellent. My wife's Ahi tempura was strange, the tastes did not go well together. The crab fried rice was not good. The prices are quite high.~NWtraveler969~Seattle, Washington
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a recent visit to Chicago, my wife & I dined recently at Eddie V's. It appeared that this is a favourite amongst locals and we were not disappointed. We opted for the Happy Hour menu in the lounge and shared 4 delicious appetizers between us.  Our favourite was the crab cake. Our server, Eleroy, was very attentive and friendly and cautioned us to share their famous Bananas Foster Cake.  It was gigantic and probably the best dessert ever!  We listened to a wonderful Jazz group while finishing our wine. It was a perfect evening and the gastronomic highlight of our wonderful visit to the Windy City!~johnG2004FS~Nanaimo, Canada
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Rarely do I enjoy a meal as much as Eddie V's.  The food was awesome and one of the most diverse menus you will see anywhere.  I enjoyed the Tuna and Bananas Foster Cake for desert.   This would be a 5 except our server was very poor.  We did let the manager know and he removed the server and had us taken care of extremely well.   A must go for ambiance and food.    ~Cspear~Pensacola, Florida
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Restaurant is located next to Gwen Hotel in Chicago's River North area.  Service was superb.  Had multiple seafood and steak choices for dinner.  I had shrimp with crab which was excellent.  Everything is ala carte and rather "pricey" so it is best to be on an expense account -but really not out of line with cost of similar upscale restaurants in the same area~HarryLeon~Arlington Heights, Illinois
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my second visit to Eddie V's this year and it surpassed all our expectations. We had a very special dinner planned with family members to celebrate two major birthdays. Eddie V's went above and beyond to make this evening very, very special from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. The service, food, ambiance and attitude were flawless in every aspect. When our fussy family members were raving during and after the meal, I knew we had made the best decision in choosing this restaurant for our celebration. If you are celebrating a special event, make sure you let them know and you will receive extra special attention. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago. Thank you Eddie V's for an unforgettable experience!~trumpy71~Sydney
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very elegant restaurant that serves great grilled steaks and provides superb attention to their guests. The Halibut ordered was over cooked and dry. Probably could have done a better job in my own kitchen. Did not send it back as that is not our way.~arguseyes6~Voorhees, New Jersey
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived about 20 minutes earlier than our reservation time.  We were greeted warmly and advised that a table would be ready in a few minutes.  Our server was welcoming, knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  The restaurant has a terrific wine list and such an enticing menu of appetizers, salads, entrees and sides.  My husband opted for the scallops with a side of crab fried rice.  I enjoyed the grilled shrimp with a Caesar salad as my starter.  When we finished our dinner and reflected on it later we both noted the excellent service and the superb cuisine.~Wimbledon47~Omaha, NE
Eddie V's Prime Seafood~6498880~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on a Thursday night.  Had a reservation for 8.  The table wasn't ready so we had a drink in the bar and looked over the menu.  They seated us before we'd finished our drinks so it wasn't too long a wait, and we ordered immediately.  By 9:10 we had not been served.  Luckily, we weren't starving :-).  The food was very good, so we almost forgot how long we waited.  We had oysters  for an appetizer and stuffed shrimp and swordfish for mains.  The desserts were good, too.  All in all, a good dinner, but we might have made the reservation for earlier if we had known.~Ajaxtol~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Absolutely delicious! I love this place! The lines are pretty long but the breakfast burgers are to die for~ maybe they're called breakfast sandwiches. But either way, so freaking good. There's limited seating at the bar but more seating outdoors and throughout inside.~nlee1220~Los Angeles, California
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another spot to get a brilliant egg sandwich for breakfast,unless you are in a hurry.  First to find parking at the grand central market is neither quick nor easy.  But if on foot, feel free to stop by Broadway and 4th but prepare to stand in line for a while.  Bring a book.~Foodie_traveler305~Los Angeles, California
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Firstly let me say that apart from the awesome reviews what attracted me to this place was its name :)......the place lived up to its hype-long queues and congested, i tried the Fairfax and Bacon and egg sandwich and both were very good.....overall a good place to start your day in DTLA.......~GurpreetMehdiratta~New Delhi, India
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I found this restaurant on IG, been following since and definitely had it on my list of places to try. The Grand Central market in downtown LA is great! The line for Eggslut gets very long but moves quick. I had the Fairfax sandwich and added avocado and bacon. My son tried the turkey sausage sandwich.  Both equally good but we loved mine better. After months of waiting to try this place, my pallet was super happy!  I'm tempted to move to LA to come work here!  I'll be back as soon as I find a job in LA!! ~Sonia B~Aurora, Illinois
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I got s sandwich and also tried the eggslut. The sandwich was delicious, but the eggslut was kind of odd. Perhaps worth trying, but I wouldn't get it again. It was also a very long wait.~LostGator09~Tallahassee, Florida
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I travel the globe 200 days a year for business and have been doing so for 11 years now. This is the standout best breakfast I've ever had! This is a "must do" if you are in downtown LA.~David B~Nyc
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So I was looking for a place to have  breakfast and stumbled onto Eggslut, and that was a fortuitous stumble, the egg and bacon sandwich was packed with flavour, was a delight in its presentation and provided us with a terrific energy start to the day. Get one you won't be disappointed...~Ckf53~Brisbane, Australia
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The line stretched a mighty long ways and the wait ended up being just under an hour.  The sandwich is delicious - really, really tasty.  The grand central market is a very cool place too.  I think the sando is more of a worth a 20 minute wait variety.  There are lots of other great places in the market to check out otherwise.~Joe20132013~Seattle, Washington
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our first trip to Eggslut and we loved it. Couple of tips...  1 - The line took us about 30 minutes to order. We went on a Sunday morning around 10am.   2 - Parking is limited. Around the corner, there is a flat parking fee of $7 per day, which gave us plenty of time to eat and see the other restaurants and bodegas.   We will be back!~mlenio11~Salt Lake City, Utah
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good breakfast. Seating is mostly outside. Orange juice is wonderful.  They have a special coddled egg dish, not my cup of tea, but I also don't like runny yolks.  Staff was very pleasant. It's more like a food court with a bar and outside tables.  Not a sit down restaurant.  But.... it was very good!~Terri S~Tacoma, WA
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got there 9:30 on a Sunday with only a few folks ahead of us in line.  Totally worth it.  One daughter had the eSlut, one had the Fairfax, and I had the Bacon, Egg, & Cheese as a salad - just marvelous - must have had six pieces of high-quality bacon in there.  Juice and cold-brewed coffee were also outstanding.  I wouldn't wait an hour in line for anything but if you get here early you won't have to wait long at all.  WORTH IT!!~Susan H~Chicago
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had to wait in line yet it was worth it!  Their eggslut was so delicious,  their eggsandwich was also very good.  A little over priced but worth the $9. Stop by if you're in LA!~Sharon S~Somerville, New Jersey
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We wanted something uncommon and that is what we got here. My husband got the eggslut and I ordered the bacon and egg sandwich. Both were very tasty, though I think my husband could have eaten 2 eggsluts for that price. They're right across a juice stand so we ordered our freshly squeezed OJ from there. The wait wasn't bad when we were there, on a Tuesday morning around 9:30am.~Najebo~Vancouver
Eggslut~6103846~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow. Some of the best eggs that I have ever had. Great egg sandwich in a funky location in DTLA. My eggs were nearly perfect, and had this place been closer to my hotel, I would have eaten here every single morning without a doubt.~acdhuber~Chicago, Illinois
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cheesecake is, hands down, my favourite dessert so, whenever I visit somewhere new, I spend time trying to find the best. Not only was this cheesecake the best in NY, it is THE best cheesecake I have had.  We ordered 3 individual sized cheesecakes - plain, blueberry and pumpkin. All 3 were fantastic, cannot fault them.  Don't miss out!~Bradders2204~Glasgow, United Kingdom
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Heard so much about this cheese cake had to visit. Lots of flavours and a nice little park opposite  to sit and eat.~Mick B~Bristol england
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I guess that's the problem with high expectations - only one way to go.  So I have to factor in all the hype and crossing the city to make a special trip...I'm afraid I have to join the other 3 stars dotted about with a 'nothing special' comment. Certainly didn't blow my socks off like the hype would have you wanting. For me, too fluffy and not creamy enough. I've had nicer cheesecakes from supermarkets and in my lifetime x2 cheesecakes from UK that really did blow my socks off. I expected so much more from the cheesecake capital of the world and supposedly the queen of the capital. On paper this should be the best cheesecake in the world, bar none. And it's not even close. It's just...average! Sorry. Firm but fair.~megatalented~Manchester
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have never eaten something like this. Amazing, I think is a must come for anyone coming to new york. ~Flor C~Helsinki, Finland
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Met the much-lauded Eileen herself on a Sat. afternoon. Service was prompt and helpful, though it'd be nice if the menus were available closer to the door rather than at the front counter. The shop is rather small and when even a few others are in line in front of you, you're not going to get to the front counter unless you're as thin as a NY fashion week runway model.   Sampled four flavors in the mini sizes available: classic / plain, pumpkin pie, salted caramel, and dulce de leche. They were all excellent, in particular the dulce de leche. To be honest, while I've had lots of dulce de leche desserts I've never been able to determine what is the the dulche de leche 'flavor' other than that it's sugar.   Salted caramel was a miss. Waaay too much salt in this dessert, such that it might've been better served renamed as caramelized salt flavor. Had to chug a lot of water after to wash the salt out--and eat lots of traditional salty Asian pickles regularly so....   Definitely stop by Eileen's if you're in the neighborhood. It's good cheesecake for a good price, and the mini sizes is helpful if you want to try different flavors!~Ealgian~New York City, New York
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Staff were very friendly.  I ordered the mango cheesecake tart which was delicious but on the small side for $3.90. This place gets a lot of tourists so time your visit well.~scatssom~London, United Kingdom
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The cheesecake was fluffy airy and tasty. It was not expensive but it truly was a memorable experience.~CarlosyCarolina~Miami, Florida, United States
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This cheesecake changed my life! I was saying a story and stopped mid sentence because the cheesecake was so good when I bit into it!~graciousnat~Los Angeles, California
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tiny place so watch carefully or you'll miss it! TONS of flavors. Individual cheesecakes are tiny so I wish I would have eaten more than one! I had the banana chocolate and my boyfriend had the salted caramel. They were just insanely delicious. Love this place.~Allison S~Springdale, Arkansas
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We happened on Eileens last time we were in New York, and went out of our way to find it again.  In my opinion, this cheesecake is better than those of Magnolia and Juniors.  It is light and fluffy and Tastes absolutely wonderful. We did not have any of the additional toppings, as in my opinion, these were not needed.  We had it two days in a row!  Wish we had one in Britain!!~walt1_10~Sheffield
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We love the cheesecake from Eileen's and we go there for the raspberry cheesecake. When we decided to make it our wedding cake we thought it would be perfect. Then we tasted the strawberry shortcake babycake and we were done for. We needed BOTH! so we spoke to Eileen and like the beautiful, amazing woman she is she made it happen. We got an amazing strawberry shortcake wedding cake and mini raspberry cheesecakes. Our guests went crazy over it and couldn't stop telling us how amazing both were! Thank you Eileen and your amazing team for making our wish come true and providing us with such an amazing wedding cake/dessert that blew everyone away!~Abel L~New York City, New York
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We wanted to not miss the very best original NY cheesecake and this place was great! Portions are perfect, plenty of options. The place is small but enough to enjoy a delicious dessert. Hope to come back soon!~ViviToro~Panama City, Panama
Eileen's Special Cheesecake~808386~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever I am within a few blocks of Eileen's (sometimes if I'm just in Manhattan) I find myself at the entrance of Eileen's longing for one of those awesome little cheesecake gems behind the glass case.  I have been to Eileen's to get some of the best cheesecake ever at least a dozen times - and have tasted all the flavors.   They are all great but my personal favorite is the cherry covered cheesecake.  The cheesecake is consistently just the right texture, not too dense, not too fluffy - just right.  You've got to try them.  Just leave one for me for my next visit.~Walt C~Milford, New Jersey
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent, wide--ranging choice.  This is cafeteria-style, so you get your food and take it to a table.  Outside seating available.  Beer and wine also.~surfonmt~Montana
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food - really enjoyed the tea selection and the sweet potato tots.  Food was made fresh to order but service was still quick.~Christen F~Seattle, Washington
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have breakfast or brunch here.  Good food, service, variety of choices, and a cheerful, bright atmosphere.  Great way to begin a day, or  enjoy a relaxed Saturday morning.~Paul J~Hillsborough, North Carolina
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having never been here before, I didn't know what to expect, but was very pleasantly surprised!  They have three separate menus, plus a number of different markets within a deli.  The food was excellent and priced fairly.  Will definitely come back to try more!~B-radLV~Las Vegas, Nevada
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the food here! It was very crowded the first time we went, so we got our food to go and went back to our hotel.  The next time we timed it better and it was less crowded and we were able to enjoy our lunch outside. Everything we tried was great. Had no problems with the staff, all were polite and efficient. Can't wait to go back the next time we're in Portland!!~Kelley M~Westford, Massachusetts
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was in town visiting family and my sister's family took us here for lunch on a Saturday and I got a wonderful surprise. The delicatessen is refreshingly clean, we were able to ask all the questions we wanted, we were able to belly up to the bar and taste some wonderful soups, and the staff was very encouraging and helpful. Only the freshest ingredients used, and some tasteful twists on old standbys. Great job.~denniswa~wa
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It has all of the elements needed for a great casual outing with friends. Lots of menu choices and the food is phenomenal. ~clarson2016~Portland, Oregon
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice selection of cheeses and meats.  It was a little confusing where to start as the deli counter and bar and tables and shopping area are all intermingled without much signage.  We ended up asking the bartender and he was happy to point us in the right direction.  We gave the person at the deli a price range and hunger level and he loaded up a very delicious selection for us.  We liked it so much that we meant to go back to pick up fixings for a picnic but never did make it before we had to fly home.  Next time, I'd like to try some of the casseroles and salads they have mixed up!~Christina H~Shawnee, Kansas, United States
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~No, they don't serve elephant here but what a place!  When we arrived at the airport we got a bite to eat at the Elephant at the airport (it's outside of TSA so anyone can go in).  It was ok.  I liked the sandwich that they made for me and my wife wasn't all that thrilled with hers.  When we headed to Washington Park, we stopped at the Elephant on 22nd Street.  Day & night difference!  What a place!  You can get whatever you want ther.  Excellent choice and availability of all sorts of foods.  Loved it!  Highly recommend it!~Carlo0647~Watsonville, California
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Once you get your bearings, this is a wonderful place.  You choose from a few of the food stations and put in your order.  They have wonderful soups and comfort foods - I was torn between the mac and cheese and the shephard's pie.  You can also get food to go like an upscale deli, as well as food gifts for a special occasion.~Timothy J~Freeport, United States
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Outstanding deli located in downtown Portland chilled selection was immense lots of choices healthy choices in the hot food selection food was prepared quickly and service was absolutely stupendous knowledgeable staff great place for breakfast or lunch.~JLHogan~Denver, Colorado
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a very nice, family friend deli located in the NW area. There are a lot of selections, and ideal for a large group with different dietary needs. Parking isn't a problem, and the staffs are very friendly. Sitting can be challenging sometimes.~udobongo~Portland, Oregon
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an excellent place for a meal near Washington Park. It is a bit overwhelming at first because there are different counters to order from for different types of food, and it all looks good. The good news is that it seems like you can't go wrong, as everything we tried was very tasty. The food is not very experimental but it is delicious and reasonably priced.  Portland had tater tots on more restaurant menus than I have seen anywhere else. Here the tots are made from sweet potatoes, very nice.~Quince967~Aiea, Hawaii
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the best one stop shop for preparing to have food on the go or a picnic.  With friendly staff, this place has cold salads, premade food, deli, pizza oven and great freshly prepared food such as fish tacos, fish and chips and burgers.  The place offers a variety of bread, desserts, beer and wine and other beverages as well.  What else could you ask for?~Megan K~San Francisco, California
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a high end food store/diner.  The employees are super efficient and the food is very fresh.  The quality is excellent and we stop by here every time we are in Portland.  Worth the stop~heumanntouch~Southern California
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ordered food to take tot he Portland Rose Garden.  The lunch was excellent and affordable.  Service was fast and friendly.  We love the new location.~Movingman143~Vancouver, Washington
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped off here on our way back to the city centre after visiting Washington Park - what a great place. You choose your lunch from the many options on offer before taking a seat if you can find table space - it's understandably popular. There are plenty of options from soups and sandwiches to shepherd's pie, calamari, fried fish .... Everything is cooked or made to order. The deli is also a market so you eat surrounded by great produce. We grabbed a couple of apple juices from the fridge and ordered a cheddar and tuna melt and turkey club. Desserts (cookies, shortbread, cheesecake, mousse) were tempting but we managed to resist. Lunch cost us around USD 20. There are outposts of Elephant's in the centre and so, if you can't make it out to the original then I'm guessing these prove a good option for a cheap and tasty light lunch option. A sign states this has been Portland's favourite deli since 1979 - I'd not be surprised!!  ~ajh8368~London, United Kingdom
Elephants Delicatessen~511727~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~with lots of tasty offerings in the cabinets and also hot items from the soup and sandwich bar. All nicely presented and delicious. Eat in or take away. Helpful and friendly staff.~Irwi~Cork, Ireland
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After spending a month in Greece last year, I was desperately seeking a place where I could get some tasty yogurt that reminded me of my trip. This place is hands down the closest I've come to finding true Greek yogurt. Forget all the supermarket brands - Chobani doesn't even come close to this. Although a bit sweeter than traditional Greek yogurt (I find it best eaten as a light dessert), it's creamy and oh-so delicious. Sample all the flavors and find one that you love! Lemon curd is my go to - I find it hard to leave with less than one of the huge family-size containers every time I visit!~crazy913~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best Greek yoghurt ever.  I especially like the lemon, which is almost like having dessert for breakfast.  I only wish they offered a granola berry combo.  Still, it is my go-to for breakfast!  Must try if you have not already.~Margaret j~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't miss this.  Its difficult to find hidden next to the produce market across the street from the big Pike Market sign but it is sooooo worth it.  We went the day before we left and actually went back the day we left to get a final taste.  We loved the pumpkin pie which actually has pumpkin pie chunks throughout.  You can get a small to share and take it to Seattle Coffee Works around the corner and across the street to sit and enjoy.~dazse~Orange County, California
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ellenos is a Seattle brand and many of their yogurts can be found in the local grocery stores and coffee shops. But it worth battling the pike place crowds because they have more flavors and at a lower price. Sometimes they have a mobile kiosk at different outdoor festivals. You'll be instantly addicted no matter how you get it. ~loveDCA~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had this yogurt for the first time at a street fair a few months ago. I am totally addicted. I was delighted to find out that there is a stand for the yogurt at the grocery store near my work.~Verita A~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I came here for breakfast and it made a nice start to my day.   The staff were so nice and helpful.  I had no clue what a Marionberry was and they took time to explain it to me, comparing it to other berries. I eventually ordered the Marionberry pie yogurt which was very delicious. It was sweet and tangy and crunchy and creamy all at the same time. There were a lot of other flavors that I normally don't see and I wanted to try them all!~Amy L~Honolulu, Hawaii
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had to try this place based on all the great reviews. It is great yogurt, no doubt. It's nice to be able to sample a few kinds before deciding. I ended up having them put 2 different kinds in a walk-around cup. It was just the right amount. I wish the raspberries were not practically frozen...they were almost too cold to eat and were much colder than the yogurt. The pumpkin pie was also quite good.~730jane~Iowa City, Iowa
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I think my favorite flavor is Chai - sounds awful for yogurt, but the spice combo is nicely mellowed in the creamy yogurt.  And that flavor is only available at their Pike Place Market location. Also like their marionberry which is available at grocery stores and some farmers markets.~mindi s~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I won't look at yogurt the same again.  Probably doesn't help that they add a bunch of sugar, but boy is it delicious.  Really should be dessert...but we thoroughly enjoyed it for breakfast!~astaplet82~Dallas, Texas
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really  smooth yogurt!  The Georgetown location of their sampling case is great!   Only open a few hours each week but it's fun to go there and visit the other little shops in Georgetown, WA...just south of Downtown Seattle.~SeatacW~SeaTac, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Simple, natural ingredients make this yogurt taste more like sweet cream!  I'm not big on yogurt, but I love Ellenos.  I look forward to a day when they distribute to the East Coast!~IslandGal1995~Ocracoke, North Carolina
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best yogurt you'll ever have.  It doesn't have that "yogurt tang" or artificial sweetener taste.  It's pure, delicious and local.  Doesn't get any better.~heidibledsoe~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The lemon curd is my JAM, but all of the berry flavors are also amazing. Been going here since they opened.~alysha n~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Their marionberry yogurt is better than any ice cream I have ever had. Highly recommend getting one of their cups to walk around eating while touring on foot, or if you're from out of town perhaps bringing a big Stanley cooler and filling it with many tubs to take home with you.~sackjaw~Seattle
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is literally the best yoghurt you will ever taste. It is thick, creamy, and ohhhhh so delicious. My 2 1/2 year old son demands this and only this yoghurt. We love the seasonal flavors including the pumpkin pie!!!~Don K~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This stuff is good even if you have never tried Greek yogurt. Although if that's the case, it may spoil you for other brands. It is smooth, creamy, tasty, and a must try if you are visiting the Pike Place Market.~dansonman22~Seattle, Washington
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped for Ellenos while approaching Pike Place for a day of touristy exploration. It was such a treat to enjoy the Mullberry Pie yogurt while walking and then again for breakfast during the week! So delicious. ~Aimee B~Auburn, Alabama
Ellenos~5598906~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~going to Pike's Market? don't forget to stop at Ellenos.  Feels like dessert, seasonal flavors, family owned.  Just do it!~CloudCityCara~Seattle, Washington
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although this place was a little loud for my tastes, it had a fun, casual vibe and friendly, efficient staff.  Our server was great and the food was very good. My friend and I split the fajitas---more than enough for two and very good!!~cindyNE~Lincoln, Nebraska
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always great food and drinks.  Great bar area and great outdoor seating.  Great beers and plenty of seating. ~MMSS~Central, NY
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beer tasting was great!  Enjoyed the spicy andouille, pasta Nola and yummy corn bread; however the pig burger was our favorite! Food service was quick.  Ambiance was just "ok" for us, felt more like a college hangout.~Martha A~Westport, Massachusetts, United States
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great beer, great food, wonderful atmosphere.  We love coming here. Local brewery with a superb restaurant ~The_Traveling_Ben~Syracuse, New York
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great martini- fish and chips were okay, the sauce was the best part of the dish. Salads are huge and the grilled chicken was fabulous. The entrance feels like your walking into a basement. Be careful if your in heels.  ~Debra S~Audubon, Pennsylvania
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service was excellent.  Atmosphere dark and dark with some black iron for contrast.  Food, just ok, 3 people, 2 sandwiches and fajitas, 2 salads, 1 beer, 2 soft drinks 75 dollars. Fajitas were cooked to death and then they drowned the skillet under cheese. The beer was good.~Jeff C~Stoneham, Massachusetts, United States
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for lunch on a weekend afternoon.  Not too crowded.  Had a bowl of the moroccan chili that was superb.~biovio~new jersey
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good service and the local beers were fabulous. Delicious chilli and burgers. Nice, quirky atmosphere.~toomuchdot~Yokohama
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went for dinner with a group of six family members on a Saturday night.   If you're a younger 20 something out with friends, it is probably a great place.   We found the menu to be uninspired, the food mediocre, and the room too loud for conversation.  Beer was good - enjoyed the variety.  Probably won't return on our next trip to Syracuse.~ksjdc~Kansas
Empire Brewing Company~950441~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What started early in the micro-brewing renaissance is now a staple of growth and consistency in the Armory Square District of downtown Syracuse. The combination of a creative diverse, high quality pub menu and excellent self-brewed beers (spirits also) makes this a real standout for lunch or dinner in Syracuse by anyone's standards.~dayseezr~Syracuse, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~All of the food is incredible and it is always made fresh and cooked to order.  The desserts are amazing too and the presentation is beautiful.  The staff are always very friendly with fast service.  Very relaxing atmosphere too.  We go here regularly and it is always a great experience.  Highly recommended!~hlawlor24~Syracuse, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Comfort food at its finest. Friendly staff, quick service, excellent food.  My favorite is the Placki hungarian style, but the hunter's stew is fantastic as it the golabki. I need to keep going back to work my way through the menu.  Have never tried the desserts, always too full but they look amazing!~CatherineH44~Syracuse, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Heard about this place from guy f! What a gem of a Resturant. Really has a home feel like you are in the kitchen of Eva's home. Guys tip for potatoe pancakes were fabulous. The pierogis are great. I tried the stuffed cabbage. The wide range of beers were awesome too. ~CamiGunther~Manalapan, New Jersey
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I ordered the kielbasa sandwich for lunch. Wow I was impressed on how lame a meal it was. $10 for a 5 inch long piece of kielbasa with a smattering of onions on a stale hogie roll and two small pickle slices. Oh lest I forget a sprig of parsley. Not what I had hoped for~Matt O~Skaneateles Falls, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Like stepping back in time to family owned home cooked polish and Hungarian meals. Food was good and service was fast,~sgmcneil~Middletown, Indiana
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I attended an RV show at Syracuse Fairgrounds, and were looking for an interesting local place for dinner. This place was great ! Pretty much a quintessential neighborhood restaurant, like you'd find 60 years ago. Menu is probably more varied than you would have seen back then, and the 12 different kinds of Polish beer would have been unheard of at that time :). Food was great. Service was friendly and efficient. The desserts were fair at best , which was a surprise given the name of the place. Prices were more than fair. We're not in Syracuse very often , but I'm sure we'll find some excuse to return to Eva's !~EricC56~Poland , NY USA
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife was in the Syracuse area for a business trip.  She and a co-worker went to this restaurant for a Saturday dinner and she told me how delicious it was.  She ordered a bratwurst plate with fried potatoes and red cabbage.  She was very impressed with cupcake dessert and its presentation. She'd never seen anything like that before or since. I was very jealous that I wasn't there.  The next time we go to the Syracuse area...we'll definitely go there!~Starview88~Dallas, Texas
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Potato pancakes and pierogi. Kielbasa and pork cutlets.Chocolate torte and plum torte.All good. And a surprisingly good value. We'll be back.~verybigv~Pennellville, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seriously some of the best food in syracuse. I can't believe it took this long to find it. And the desserts are to die for. Definitely get the mushroom croquettes~gogetgabby~Syracuse, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Spur of the moment decision to head here. What an amazing treat! Authentic Polish food, beer, and desserts! We order potato pancakes(best ever!), Golabki, and Pierogi( bacon and sauerkraut) . Hearty portions, and amazing flavor.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Thank you for a great evening! ~Richard Z~Central Square, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere was a little like being in a grandma's kitchen, but not overly decorated.  There were several rooms in which to sit.  All the servers were pleasant and friendly.  We ordered a variety of items for the table: meat and potato and mushroom pierogi, stuffed cabbage, carrot salad, kielbasa platter.  Everything was fresh and homemade.  The carrot salad was fantastic.  We were full but the dessert case was very inviting, so we took home one piece of a walnut buttercream cake to have for later in the evening. We enjoyed it - not too sweet, but satisfying. I would recommend this restaurant.~PamelaDeP~Cherry Hill, New Jersey
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was good, but the food was so-so. Mind you, I only had the potato mushroom pierogies. They were kind of bland and undercooked. ~danielle b~Buffalo, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant was featured on the Food Channel as on of the hot spots in Syracuse and yes it is ! It features fine Greek cuisine. Come hungry because the portions are huge and Sooo good !~Lisa R~Syracuse, New York
Eva's European Sweets~421836~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've lived in Syracuse for about 22 years and just got to visiting Eva's.    21 years wasted.  What a delightful meal we had.  Huge portions of really really delicious food was served plate after plate.  We are a family of three and ordered so that we could share (a very good strategy to assure that you can try lots of the dishes).  We had carrot salad, cabbage rolls, kielbasa dinner, beet side, potato pancake and apple sauce, meat perogies and the cabbage and bean side...  Yes.  You're correct.  Too much food for three, but we couldn't help ourselves.  The food was absolutely as great as the descriptions in the menu.  The kielbasa was mild and smoky and wonderful, served with fried onion and potatoes.  The cabbage rolls were truly remarkable- beef and rice rolled in cabbage without the slightest hint of grease!  Flavorful and delicious.  If it is possible for ground beef to be "fluffy", Eva's pulled it off!   So, we then asked for boxes and then (crazy as it sounds) ordered dessert!  Gooseberry pie and Fried Apple Cake.  Oh my!  Despite being completely full, we shared the fantastic desserts. Would highly recommend this restaurant to locals or visitors.  We waited too long to try it, but won't be waiting long to go back.~Joe_Syracuse~Syracuse, New York
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A superb evening in a grand restaurant where the ambient noise allows conversations without having to shout --- a phenenom not often found in DC restaurants. Great food served by an attentive and knowledgeable staff who make you feel very welcome. Not inexpensive, but worth every penny.~wraopera~Washington Dc
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Burrata was extraordinarily creamy; filet was extraordinarily tender and tasty; dessert was rich, delicious and modest in portion so you don't leave feeling like a whale. The food seemed more refined than the atmosphere, which was quite nice but not as elegant as the food prep.~Paul K~Atlanta, Georgia, United States
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious Italian food, huge portions and impeccable service!!! At the end of the meal they bring carafes of Amaretto and Annise liqueur to your table (complimentary) for you to enjoy, very nice touch!~jjklr~Freeport, Maine
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner for 2 with drinks was right at $300.  We had all small plates including foie gras (superlative), lobster ravioli (good), pasta with white truffles (not worth the $50 price tag), among other tastes.  It was overall a delicious and entertaining meal, but a little uneven in the food and timing between dishes.  They're packed now that Michelin started awarding stars in DC, so maybe that accounted for the unsteadiness.  We'll likely try again.~CCC~Annapolis, Maryland
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Eat everything. It's fantastic. We sat outside on the gorgeous upper deck. Service was wonderful and the food was delicious. Worth the price. ~PeterParker47~Olney, Maryland
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fiola has an elegant, modern interior, helpful and attentive staff, and delightful dishes that all added up to an excellent dining experience.  I arrived a little early so started off with an refreshing "Bellagio" cocktail at the bar.    Feeling both hungry and indulgent I opted for the "Decadence" menu of five courses plus dessert and also had the wine pairings.  Each dish was beautifully presented with fresh, distinctive flavours.  I particularly enjoyed the foie gras, lobster, and wagyu beef courses.  Each wine was well matched to the courses.  The staff were very attentive and friendly, explaining each course and wine.  The restaurant has a Michelin star (and deservedly so) but is not stuffy or formal.  Yes, it is somewhat expensive, but a worthwhile treat.~Simon C~Birmingham, United Kingdom
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fiola is a chic restaurant that offers sophisticated food, a strong wine list and warm service.  Fiola offers an elegant atmosphere that would be suitable to an important business event, special gathering or romantic meal.    Our primary server this evening was Mark.  From the moment the dinner began, he took great care to ensure that every member of our party was treated warmly.  He offered each of us wise selection counsel, from cocktails to main course.  His wine choices were also excellent.  Impeccable performance.  The menu is imaginative and off menu specials were offered.  The blue crab appetizer followed by potato gnocchi, leaves from the garden, and waygu beef and branzino were delicious.  Bread rolls were quite good.  The composition of the food and attractive presentation underscored the art that the Fiola kitchen brings to a meal.  Valet parking is available.~L V~Maryland
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fiona has revised its menu to more of a tasting menu. A wonderful variety of beautifully presented dishes. Exceptional service. Not inexpensive (on the contrary) but an exquisite experience. ~Glen B~Newboro, Canada
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fiona offers 4 course meal for two plus bottle of wine for $85, when seated from 5.00 - 6.30 p.m. Tried it and feel like going back as soon as I can. What a treat. Salad, Pasta, chicken and dessert. all very good, but the chicken was beyond incredible. Wine was good, waiter (cannot remember name, but he was from Wisconsin) was super nice, also to our two little girls, who felt like royalty. Jazz band was nice addition.~Thomas443~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been here several times (for business meals as well as personal meals) in the past three years. The food *was* unbelievably delicious three years ago, but in the past two years, it seems like the restaurant has been exploring different menu options and pricing options, and I had one really terrible meal here that seemed a bit experimental. For the price, I expect much more consistently high quality food.~1828traveler1828~Washington
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was a special celebration and we chose the 4 course option. Each and every course was a taste of elegance and flair that even the most discerning palate can appreciate. The lobster ravioli, a house specialty with a large amount of lobster and a simple preparation allowed the key component to shine. For me that was the highlight of evening, but truly everything was delicious.   The ahi tuna appetizer, was a masterpiece of presentation and tasted as good as it looked. The ossobuco tortellini was my husband's most memorable dish for certain, and a nice departure from the fish I prefer.  We were both very pleased with our meal from start to finish. The grand wine pairings, which we also included, catered to our preferences individually and worked well with each course. It was a wonderful touch, as it added even more to our positive feelings about the restaurant overall.   The waitstaff was attentive on a busy Saturday evening, and we will definitely go back again, but will probably save it for a special occasion.~Kristen M~Washington
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband stopped in for a couple of cocktails, scotch tasting and foie gras.  I enjoyed the Aged Manhattan which was different from any Manhattan because of the orange bitters.  My  husband sampled several scotches and we both had a lovely glass of red wine with our foie gras.  We definitely will come back for dinner.~AMkM1234~Orlando, Florida
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service was very nice.  Didn't realize that a la carte menu was available in outside seating and bar area. Ended up with tasting menu, which was a fortune.  Portions were tiny.  One course for my wife was oysters; it came with three.  I had to order another three.  Not worth the price.~Robert S~Dudley, Massachusetts
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a top of the line restaurant in DC. The decor is beautiful and tasteful, good chairs, good silverware and glasses. The food is also very good and the service is way better than what you would normally find in the U.S. Staff are pros, proficient and friendly, from the sommelier to our waiter. Warning: this is a pricey restaurant. Be mindful of that when ordering~GlobalTravelMan2014~Sao Paulo, SP
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was one of the best meals I have had in D.C.  The appetizers were amazing. The pasta was some of the best I have ever had. The bronzino was amazing. ~stentdoc~Syosset, New York
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Top shelf ingredients, preparation and presentation. Attentive wait staff and creative  menu without being so esoteric that nothing seems appetizing.  I have had that experience at other 5 star establishments.  You leave truly appreciating the quality of ingredients and the effort required to prepare and serve the meal. The wait staff is professional, friendly and knowledgeable.   This is downtown DC dining at it's finest, so expect commensurate expenses. Overall, one of the finest dinners ever for me. A minor issue was the menu...a bit difficult to navigate and understand the pricing structure.   This was a family dinner for 6 adults.  We appreciated the acoustics  and  adequate separation from other tables, which enhance the experience at Fiola allowing conversation with ease and privacy.  We had some great dinners at "world class" places in New Orleans just a day or two before, but felt crowded and noisy by comparison. A table side visit by Chef Chad made for a memorable evening.~Mrchubs~Kingston PA
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped accidentally at this restaurant for an unplanned lunch during our visit in Washington DC. Impressive deco. Excellent food. Excellent wine. Superb service.~Maryse K~Wilmington, Massachusetts
Fiola~2137407~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We wanted to try someplace new to us to celebrate our anniversary. Fiola did not disappoint!  From cocktails to post dessert chocolates, this place is special because it strives to make its guests feel pampered and comfortable. Our food and wait staff were exceptional!  We will be back for more tasting at this wonderful restaurant, and we won't wait for a special event!~cliofan2016~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food portions were generous.  House burger was flavorful.  Linguine and Shrimp was rated just "so so".  Service was adequate, but given the pricing should have been better.  ~King_Bob_Rules~Taylorsville, Utah
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Generally, I don't find hotel restaurants to be very good at all, but Fire and Oak is an exception.  The menu is varied and the staff is attentive.  There's a great bar if you want to meet up with friends just for drinks after work.~Chris F~New York City, New York
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great egg white omelet and oysters. Large groups and diverse extented families made the vidit festive. Superior coffee~Eric B~Brooklyn, New York
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food with excellent service...what more could you ask for? Free parking and usually not too crowded. Really a hidden gem in JC.~David Z~Jersey City, New Jersey
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I asked for U8 shrimps (comes with nothing, just 4 shrimps) with scalloped potatoes, the shrimps were a bit warm and the potatoes in the middle were cold, only the cheese on top was a bit warm. Very disappointing for the price I paid.~Catalin T~Montreal
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Little on the expensive side. The restaurant is nice and has a good feel to it. The bartender was not polite though.~Raj S~Boston, Massachusetts
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friends and I have eaten at this restaurant several times the atmosphere is wonderful quiet open and the service is very friendly. As my friends and I can spend a large amount of time chatting over lunch or dinner we never feel rushed at Fire & Oak. I usually get the seven spice tuna and it's delicious every time my friends are more apt to try items like the rotisserie chicken and the mac and cheese....never a complaint. They also have some very nice mixed drinks although I don't drink my friends leave very happy with what they ordered. The icing on the cake has to be the easy access to parking. There is a parking garage available right next to the Westin where the fire and Oak is there's also valet parking if you wish. I would recommend this place to anyone although it is a bit pricey it's worth it.~M G~United States
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice restaurant if your in the area. Service was ok, but not the best. Food was all well prepared and enjoyed by all. Most of the menu items were pretty standard fare.~Darren L~Queenstown, Maryland
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pleasantly surprised, first off parking super easy especially in Jersey City you can park in the Westin's garage and get your parking ticket validated after you leave, during brunch you have the choice of unlimited champagne, mimosas or Bellini. I had the Bellini and was pleasantly surprised. Our server was Mr. Greg. He was supper knowledgeable, and very pleasant, all staff members were serving evening Mr. Errick the owner who I had a pleasant conversation with about our shirts refilled my Bellini. The food was impeccable and the conversation with our server Mr Greg......priceless. An overall great experience I will definitely be here again. The menu has everything from burgers to sushi and the drinks were amazing such a great experience, please come visit this awesome detailed establishment.~rhodellp~Plainfield, New Jersey
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in here for a quick drink and dessert after work.  Very nice atmosphere, Had a beer and piece of key lime pie, which was one of the best ever!  other food on the menu looked quite good as well. they do nightly specials. i.e. Tues was 1/2 off sushi night.  service was very good and the place was clean and quiet.~Roadie802~Rutland, Vermont
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere is ok; it is a little sterile. Also, the food is not very good at all. The menu is large, which is ALWAYS a bad sign because that means a great deal of the food is probably frozen. I ordered a burger, and I had a better burger at a fast food place than this place. Despite the food being on the level below or equal to a pedestrian diner, the bill was an equal or greater amount to Manhattan prices.   The bartender was brusque, and the waiter, although polite, was rushing us. Not impressed one iota.~PAffenita~New York City, New York
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The brunch was delicious however I believe sixty dollars for two people for brunch is over board. We ordered French toast sauted with bananas and chicken salad. Fairly simple. We enjoyed the food. The ambiance was pretty quiet and family oriented which is always good for myself.   The bill came and it was a disappointment just because I have been to 5 star restaurants that wouldn't overpriced their food like this. This is one thing I believe they need to rethink.~Maroonsabr~Jersey City, New Jersey
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is within The Westin hotel and as the hotel it has extremely high prices in relationship with the quality~pepe_madrid08~Lucerne, Switzerland
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Too tired to leave the hotel, I ventured downstairs. Very noisy, so the hostess suggested outdoor seating. Nice breeze, good people viewing seat! Service was good - obvious newbie waiter tried hard and was attentive. Menu was nicely varied. GOod wine list. Food well-prepared. A good dining option in Jersey City~Leonard S~Stockbridge, Massachusetts
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very disappointed about the food and service. We ordered sushi which it was one of the worst I ever had. Service not attentive at all, all waiters seating across the main room, more focusing closing their shift then see over the guest.~Vito D~New York, New York, United States
Fire & Oak - Jersey City~1455328~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a lovely evening at Fire & Oak last night.  Friday night is their lobster night special.  For 35.00 you get an appetizer, a lobster and a dessert.  A few people in our party had this special and they were very pleased.  I had the fried calamari that was one of the best I have ever tasted and the salmon over a bed of couscous.  The salmon was very good also. I had tiramisu for dessert and it was delectable. Overall we had a fantastic meal and we will definitely will be back soon. ~Scuba024~New Jersey
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A cool and modern place for breakfast.  So many things on offer from oats, french toast, to a bacon and egg sandwich roll.  Not the cheapest for breakfast but still worth it as it was so tasty and great coffee too!~Nicola R~Glasgow, United Kingdom
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Actually, everything I have had at Flour has been wonderful. I love their black bean soup - a tad spicy and delish! Even when the line is long, they have a very efficient process so you don't have to wait too long. Convenient spot. Staff is always super nice. They have an awesome Japanese green tea, too.~Diane123Diane~Massachusetts
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great sandwiches with very prompt service even though there was a long line. Good place for a quick meal. ~Goh C~Penang
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I landed in Boston later than planned and wanted a quick, but healthy/tasty dinner when I got to Boston. I tried Flour Bakery and Cafe which was open until 8pm and was not disappointed. Traditional sandwich combos with a fun little twist. I did roast beef with horseradish sauce and it had crunchy onions - like the ones on a green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. Yes! Service was super friendly. Everything well done. I didn't try the pastries but they looked great!~CuriosaGirl~Denver, Colorado
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Interesting sandwich fillings, great coffee ( best I drunk during our trip) and wonderfully delicious cakes. It is proper food, home cooking. ~Purdy006~London
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the granola and steel cut oats so much, we had to come back for another breakfast, even though we were only in town for a couple of days. Good coffee. Relaxed atmosphere. Very friendly, efficient staff. ~VFLondon~Edinburgh, United Kingdom
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On this trip to Flour in the Boston Seaport I was with the entire family and looking for a quick morning treat.  They have a wide selection of pastries to choose from that all look really good.  I chose the almond croissant and it was big and rich.  Kids had the cinnamon sticks.   This is a busy spot on a side street in the Boston Seaport.  The only negative to this visit and experience at Flour was a woman/girl in front of us in line who apparently dislikes small children being near her.  My older son bumped into her while we were waiting to pay and she made some snide remark and huffed off.   I honestly felt sorry for her that she was that miserable of a person.   Other than that, loved Flour and will return! ~cbrislin~North Attleboro, Massachusetts
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ordered a bunch of sandwiches from Flour for a client lunch. They were all AMAZING - I ate several. Brownie was also delicious!~Elizabeth G~New York City, New York
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So, I was a bit disappointed when I came here, for mostly service reasons. I had heard the hot chocolate and chocolate chip cookies couldn't be beat here, so my husband and I headed over here for a late breakfast along with some treats. When I got there, the espresso machine was broken so I could not get a latte or a hot chocolate. I was disappointed, but quickly became furious when the person behind the counter said, "Oh yeah it stopped working yesterday." Excuse me? You are primarily a breakfast place, I got there at 12PM, you knew this was broken YESTERDAY and you have done nothing to get it fixed? This might sound entitled, but you are a business that customers rely on for specific things. You are supposed to provide those things. I really couldn't believe this. I ordered an almond croissant, which was delicious and an egg and cheese sandwich with arugula on a brioche bun. That was just okay. The egg was akin to one you would get on an egg mcmuffin at McDonalds, the brioche was greasy. I wasn't a huge fan. They did not have any chocolate chip cookies when we arrived. This place was pretty disappointing and expensive.~Jvalliant~Brooklyn, New York
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great restaurant if you are looking for a sandwich place for lunch and a sweet treat for dessert!  The roast beef sandwich was amazing however the chicken caesar salad that I opted for one day had a lot of dressing, which next time I would ask for on the side.  I forgot it had garbanzo beans and found them at the bottom of the bowl.  I loved their dark chocolate coconut cookie and was so tempted by their lemon meringue pie!  Lots of younger people, families with small children and "hip" older people patronized the restaurant when I was there.  Next time I'm in Boston, I will eat here again!~MaeGoBlue~Brighton, Michigan
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is essentially an upscale Panera with lots of choice, variety, and creativity imbued into every sandwich or treat you get. Very reasonably priced for the high quality food you will be served. Sort of busy and hectic in there (and this was just a Sunday!) but I'd say definitely worth it. Highly recommended.~jmarklawson~Whitinsville, Massachusetts
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visiting from Chicago, my husband and I needed a break from our sight-seeing adventures. We stopped in for some sweet treats at Flour Bakery, and they delivered just that! The employee we encountered was extremely friendly and patient  as he helped educate us about the local favorites. I went with the sticky bun. It was full of flavor and had enough pecans so that every bite captured one. My husband enjoyed the lemon meringue cupcake. The ration of filling to cake was spot on. Our only wish was that both treats were a bit moister, but we overcame that  with a tall glass of ice-cold milk. Great spot for a delicious treat.~Michaele T~Carol Stream, Illinois
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate way too much but most definitely worth the visit. The Sticky buns are a must and the breakfast sandwich was just as delightful! Glad we missed the lunch crowd...line was out the door when we were done eating.~5280Fam~Denver, Colorado
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked over from our hotel and there was a long line out to the door.  We had latte and some carmel rolls and a bluebery muffin.  All very good.~Pam S~Minnetonka, Minnesota
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a wonderful bakery and such lovely, friendly staff...  Visited here a few times during our week in Boston and loved everything that we had...  If I lived here I would be as fat as a house ;-)  Definitely a recommend...~Geoff and Jenni G~Sarasota, Florida
Flour Bakery & Cafe~1131010~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~fresh baked goods and creative sandwich selections.  Always consistent and good.  Friendly staff at all locations.~Gin C~Boston, Massachusetts
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although there is always a lot of people in the line the service is very good and they are fast! If you don't have time to stay and sit down or there is not enough space you can ask for your order to go! I love all the pastries there, the carrot cake is amazing and the low fat chocolate muffins are my favorites! Coffee is also very tasty and at a very good price!!! They also offer different sandwiches, salads and a soup of the day!~Mercedes P~Marbella, Spain
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived at Logan airport at 8am, after leaving ungodly early, so we were starving. Our first stop was going to be the Museum of Fine Art, so we wanted something local near there, and with the awesome reviews I knew we had to try Flour. We managed to score some on-street parking right across from Flour, so right then I knew we were going to have a great experience. We were quickly served, and it was so hard to choose as everything looked amazing. We picked a selection of sticky buns and chocolate brioche rolls and within minutes we were in heaven! Everything was so fresh and delicious, we enjoyed it all to the last bite. We ate inside, and everything was nice and clean. It really set the tone for our whole trip, and I am so sad that there isn't anything like it in Ohio! Would definitely go back again in a heartbeat.~worleybird98~Hudson, Ohio
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great quick stop for healthy, fresh and gourmet style food.  Beautiful and tasty pastries and great coffee!~binamistry~toronto
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a really delicious breakfast but be prepared for a wait. We were lucky to be seated right away but 1.5 hour wait when we left. Food is a little out of the ordinary in a good way. Service so-so but overall great without the wait~lloyd s~New York City, New York
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was skeptical that this place was worth all of the wait.  I hate waiting.  But I was hungry and didn't feel like looking for another place.  I had the breakfast sandwich with ham.  It was not your normal breakfast sandwich.  The choice of ham (it's really more like prosciutto), the type of cheese (maybe there was some hollandaise sauce too?), the egg souffle (vs normal fried egg), and peppery arugula on the softest (yet just enough thin chewy crust) bread -- delicious.  The Americano was piping hot.  Well done.  Too often coffee is lukewarm.  Cookie was great too.  Go!~StuckOnTravels~New York City, New York
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My sister took me here for buy pastries for breakfast but in the end also purchased roast beef sandwiches for the drive home.  Pricey but the food was delicious.  Would definitely return.~rvk1995~Tenafly, New Jersey
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So I know it sounds odd because a Crispy treat is simple.  But this was a brown butter crispy treat and it was so awesome and big and yummy.  Also had a cupcake which was great.  ~kare17~Rochester, New York, United States
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sometimes, the planets align and you end up somewhere only destiny could have directed you to.  This place is "flour" for me.  I'll start with the sandwiches - freaking amazing. My husband and I always split the roast beef, and one other sandwich (on a rotating schedule). The bread is made in shop, meat is cut in shop, other ingredients are freshly made, and they always served at the perfect temperature. It is a simple recipe - fresh, homemade, and with care - yet you can't get this most places. Flour makes these things their priority.  Most visits, I will also get their homemade soup of the day - because I love soup and they always have something creative and delicious that I don't want to miss out on.  I would be remiss to not comment on their desserts! My husband craves their oreos, while I gravitate toward the rice crispy treats and chocolate chip cookies. The best gift I have received in my adult life is the "flour" cookbook (#1- desserts). They share their secrets to making these perfect treats, and I am so thankful because I wouldn't be able to afford our addition to this place.  I have been to all 3 locations and they all have the same quality, just different size "restaurants". Get thee to the nearest flour and order up!~Samantha W~Chicago, Illinois
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for brekki. Ordered spelt oat and currant scone and coffee. Tasty and worth the long lines. Three people take orders to move the line as quickly as possible but this is a popular place so expect lines.~Cindy H~Charlotte, NC
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The lines stretching from Flour on a Sunday morning can be daunting but they move quickly and are well worth braving in any case. This is a well-oiled machine with exceptional baked goods, but it's more than breakfast of internationally famous sticky buns and croissants. The lunch offerings are substantial, and the beverage selection is very good. I particularly like the service here - the people behind the counter are knowledgeable and easy to work with.  The dine-in space is good but a huge part of Flour's business is takeout. go early - a lot of items run out by midday.  ~Lyn_Farmer~Miami, Florida
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a different kind of place. You order and they call out your name when it's ready. While you can go healthy there's plenty of baked goods that  WILL tempt you. Some tables outside are a good choice on those warm days. We didn't realize there were multiple locations until we started noticing them.~wasntme58~Toronto, Canada
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place gets very busy so it might be hard getting seated at times but the service is certainly quick. They have a good selection of pastries and the breakfast options are delicious. I enjoyed their latte but my husband wasn't keen on their house coffee. For me, it's fun trying local cafes rather than always ending up in a Starbucks!~Amira P~New Orleans, Louisiana
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very busy but efficiently handling both eat- in and take away options. I had a lovely bowl of oatmeal with berries and almonds. I tried the mocha instead of a usual coffee and it was too sweet for my taste.~sarah s~Perth, Australia
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good place for breakfast.  Casual and friendly environment.  The steel oats were very tasty and the coffee was good.~Pauline H~Costa Mesa, California, USA
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We wanted to walk so the directions were easy from our hotel on Arlington.. cool place, very popular it seemed by locals, standing room only.. wonderful selection, it was hard to choose~Stephanie D~Portland, Maine
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great choice of food. We had breakfast but for lunch it would be great also. Don't expect table service, because orders are taken at the counter. We came in on a sunday morning and it was quite packed. Service was swift though. ~Machiel S~Wormer, The Netherlands
Flour Bakery & Cafe~322321~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow, I love this place! We had breakfast sandwiches one morning (which were very very good!). I also tried Brown Butter Rice Krispie bar, pumpkin muffin, caramel pecan roll, caramel pecan bread pudding, and a mixed fruit scone. Everything was delicious except for the scone. I was expecting it to be more berries or something instead of raisins. It was just ok. The rest though was outstanding. It should be a must see!!~sniperaimee~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Brazilian steakhouses are a true delight. They begin with a buffet that includes salad, soup, and all sorts of marvelous veggies. Then waiters bring around skewers of meat -- chicken, lamb, sausage, and a variety of cuts of steak. They slice off pieces that meet your desire in terms of how well cooked. And you can get as much as you want. My wife and I ate in them regularly when we were in Rio about 10 years ago. Fogo de Chao in Philadelphia, where we live, does an excellent job of bringing the experience to America. Not as good as the Rio experience, but damned close. If you love meat, this is an ideal place to go especially for lunch when prices are much more reasonable.~Baskinman~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fogo de Chao is a very nice restaurant. Nice atmosphere, great food, unique setup, and good location in philly. It is veryyyyyy pricey!! A lil overpriced in my opinion but worth the experience to try at least once. Treat yourself!~GypsiiRose~Delaware
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fogo de Chao is pretty much all you can eat meat restaurant.  Be sure to no fill up on the Salad bar.~Nani R~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and staff.  The atmosphere is great also since this is an old historic building.  The salad buffet is awesome and the meats!!!!!!  Cooked to perfection and great flavor with an attentive staff.~Padre86~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great selection of meats (served hot) and choices from soup & salad bar. (Salad bar kept neat & clean.) Cocktail menu. We dined with a large group and felt a little rushed with our meat service. Excellent servers. ~mhdaisy~Carmel, Indiana
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Green means bring me the meats and red mean no mas!  They offer a nice variety of meats to satisfy everyone.  The meats are brought to your table and you decide if you want a piece that is rare or well done....that is if your card is on green.  If your card is on red they will bypass your table.  The salad bar is also very good but don't fill up on the breads and soup.  Bring on the meats!~rusty1970~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I took my Korean colleagues here to get a taste of a Brazilian steakhouse and we all had a great meal. Bring your appetite because you will be eating A LOT. Excellent salad bar and also a tasty variety of meats served in the *churrascaria* style. For your health I do recommend loading up on the great variety of vegetables at the salad bar (asparagus, beets, broccoli, green beans, sweet potato, ...) and actually a vegetarian could surprisingly make quite a meal here. However you are likely to gorge yourself on the meats. Service was good although there were dead times in our meal when we didn't have a server hovering over us with a skewer of meat, perhaps because we were sitting in the corner. The first wine we ordered (Robert Mondavi cab sauvignon) was superb but I was disappointed by the bland second wine we were recommended (something from Paso Robles). I thought the waitstaff should have been more knowledgeable about wines to recommend. Vibe is big brash American steakhouse and there is really nothing intimate or Brazilian about it. And the bill was enormous -- I'm really happy my company was covering. This was a good meal but to be honest I think this place is living a bit off the chain brand name rather than this restaurant's quality.~jrh825~Seoul, South Korea
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you ever wanted to try a different cut of meat, this is the place to go! Top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet, flank steak, it's all available! Even watching the servers walk around with different skewers of meat options is an experience. The market table offers so many delicious options from soup to bacon. That's right, candied black pepper bacon. I could have eaten that by itself. I also highly recommend the molten chocolate cake. It's heavenly!~Jenifer S~Rio Grande, New Jersey
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you love meat, then this is a good place to go.  I will warn you that they have an incredible salad bar.  So don't fill up on that too much before dinner. ~josephshepherd~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located in heart of Philadelphia right next to Macy's this national chain restaurant serves a large salad buffet followed by a wide array of grilled meats presented by waiters with kebab swords. There's a lot of food and if you're really hungry it might be a good value as it's unlimited but otherwise rather expensive ~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I enjoyed lunch here today and we raved about all aspects of the experience....ambiance, food and service.   AMBIANCE..In central Philly in historic and gorgeous building designed by Horace Trumbauer with French crystal chandeliers and 20 foot ceilings, Very special!  FOOD.....my husband and I watch our waist lines and do not frequently eat a lot of red meat. Therefore, we had thought a concept like this would not work for us. However, Fogo offers more than the never ending meat on skewer option. Take alook and see the many, mnay, many options included in their MARKET TABLE offering which is just $15 at lunch. Besides never ending salad options, soups, Brazilian specialities, wonderful candied bacon, proscioutto, tons of fresh fruit, and many marinated veggies (all delicious.....the candied bacon, the yams with cherries nad cinnamon, the sun dried tomatatoes, sweet peppers that suddenly turned on the HOT, butternut squash soup, and the Biggest bowl of hard cut parmesan cheese I ever saw were all particular favorites of mine). On top of the $15 lunch market table option, you can add a meat selection for $6 to $9 ...i opted for lamb, my husband sirloin, we were surprised as the gaucho shaved several cuts onto our plates and then advised he would come back to add more later...and to this they added garlic mashed potatoes, carmelized banana, and crispy polenta. Add a nice glass of wine (Malbecs ranged $11-13) and you have a feast. Save room for dessert (hah).....we were full and declined BUT out came a complimentary and large wonderful cherry cheese cake since we were there iwth a Birthday Reward (join the Fogo club online and get wonderful rewards to enjoy on your special occasion). Fabulous.  The service throughout was top notch....just the right amount of attention and sincere requests by servers and managers to olease let them know if we needed anything, ir needed to change the temperature of the meats etc.   I am so glad my sister suggested we look into the Fogo club to receive special notices nad offers. That is what brought us here this day....and we will return for sure. I hope you give it a try. You will enjoy it!~MEDISKIS~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Oh boy, be prepared for a meal - a big, delicious meal!  Very attentive wait staff and the food is plentiful.  Always smiling!  It was a pleasure to dine here with our two kids, 5 and 8.  They were in love with the salad bar.  Sadly there was no room for dessert.~sbaltz4856~Mansfield, Ohio
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food and service is good here, especially considering that they have a lot of people. If you want a specific cut of meat, just ask. I would not fill up on the sides, save room for the meat!~nmjr11~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The reviews of this restaurant are false. This is a large chain paying people to write these reviews. We have even challenged OPEN TABLE to meet us at this restaurant for proof, they DECLINED.  The restaurant is small, food is over salted, salad bar is small compared to other like it. Beef ribs are the worst.  If this place was any good they would not be offering 1,000 open table points, all kinds of promotions and discounts, and discounted gift cards on line to get you in. We are 65, and 62 and can afford to dine in center city all the time. This chain was bought out over two years ago and has sucked ever since. Please try CHIMA for the REAL Brazilian Steakhouse experience. Thank you~dominic1007~phila., pa.
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is my twelfth year staying at this hotel. I would not consider staying at another hotel in the area. Upon arriving I was greeted with a warm smile and greeting. By both Tina the manager  and  Niazha the desk clerk I felt like I was being welcomed home again. This is my home for seven weeks. ~mrbillsr~lincoln , De.
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is overrated and emphasises quantity over quality. The only great thing here is the salad bar. Everything else is mediocre at best. I've been several times and it's just not good. There are definitely worse places to go, but for the price go elsewhere and spend the same or less on a good quality piece of meat.~Ulikethat1~Philly
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We love this place!  Love the all you can eat meat and the cuts did not disappoint this time.  The Parmesan-encrusted pork loin was absolutely delicious...we're usually all about the steak but we sought out that one a few times.  The garlic steak is always great as is the filet.  We were celebrating 3 birthdays and everyone enjoyed the evening.  Service was wonderful, the gauchos were very prompt in bringing the meat and the refills of the popovers and mashed potatoes were prompt. The salad bar has grown over the years, and is impressive.  As much as I don't like to fill up on the non-meat options, they do have a lot of tasty offerings like cheese, soup, grilled veggies and salads. Good varieties on the wine list, too. Definitely worth it for a special occasion.  Considering it's all you can eat meat, it's not a bad value, either.~Kimberly S~Moorestown, New Jersey
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Fogo de Chao last night electing to go for the salad bar option as none of us could face loads of meat. Having eaten at Fogo branches all over the US, we were looking forward to a good meal - how wrong we were! The salad bar was not kept topped up; our server seemed to lose interest from the point we said we were only doing the salad; our white wine wasn't put in a bucket to chill - and I even had to go to the pay station to ask for the check as our server was nowhere in sight! A truly disappointing evening - if this is typical of Fogo on a weekday evening, I won't ever do it again.~Mark G~Basingstoke, United Kingdom
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse~796067~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for our anniversary and were very pleased with the selection, quality, presentation, and service. The salads, vegetables, and cheeses in the bar had some innovative touches (kale and quinoa) and included traditional favorites like smoked salmon with capers. The roasted meats are preserved table side with a flourish, and you can specify how cooked you would like them. The garlic sirloin and lamb were particularly good. The meats can be salty though. Our server Sivi who was very attentive surprised us with cheesecake at the end of our meal and took our picture, topping off a terrific meal and experience in a beautifully renovated historic building. ~Kim W~Clinton, Maryland, United States
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A great restaurant in a not-so-great neighborhood.  We had a delicious lunch out on the beautiful terrace that feels more like a cafe in Europe than a restaurant on the north side.  The service was as excellent as the meal.~hlawlor24~Syracuse, New York
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A late summer visit put us in the gorgeous outdoor courtyard.  What an absolutely wonderful evening. The atmosphere was so serene right in the middle of Syracuse, and the food perfect! The steaks are aged to perfection and cooked exactly as ordered. Easily becomes your favorite place to eat.~CharlesandPaula~Cortland, New York
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A very solid meal again... we've come several times, with big groups or just the two of us - atmosphere is great and food is always delicious!~mac1724~Syracuse, New York
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although a visit to this restaurant is a pleasure anytime, Summer dining, in their backyard Sicilian garden is the best !!!! The atmosphere inside and out is wonderful. The food exquisite! Great wines and cocktails. Wait staff couldn't be more pleasant! They also have a fire pit in the back garden that's inviting when the weather gets chilly. This is a must visit restaurant.~Tropicgal1~Windham
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ate dinner last night with my wife and kids as we were in town for Parents Weekend at Syracuse University. Went to the place based on recommendations from parent portal at the website. Because its a busy weekend we called in advance and made the reservation which was held with our credit card. We were told that if we did not keep the reservation we would be charged $50.00 on the card. Should have known at that time we should have passed and gone to another place. Honestly, we respect the fact that the restaurants rely on patrons keeping the reservations and on the few times there has been a problem we have always called the restaurant no later than the morning or early afternoon of the reservation. However, when we arrived we were expecting a menu mostly of Italian fare. Instead the waiter told us that due to Parents Weekend the menu was changed and an emphasis was placed on rack of lamb and dry aged steak. Honestly, the restaurant should have notified us of this change when taking the reservation. How were we to know that the menu would change that evening. Not the right thing to do. Food was okay. However, was not expecting to pay $40.00 a person with tip for dinner with the kids.~idanaLongIsland_NY~Long Island, NY
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every time we go to Francesca's we have a great meal and a great time. Service is top notch. Food is delicious.~Mark M~Cicero, New York
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First of all I can't imagine any place is better then Francesca's, in fact we ate at Dinosaur last night, Francesca's should be higher on the list.  With that being said, we did not have reservations but arrived early (5:45) and were able to be seated right away.  We chose to sit in the patio, I highly recommend this area.  It is lovely with really nice touches of vines, and great design.  The service was good and not over bearing.  We had the wagyu ravioli And the homemade gnocchi in a pink vodka sauce, we both chose a house salad. The ravioli was filled with short ribs, wagyu beef and porcini mushrooms served with a cream Marsala sauce.  Awesome!  The gnocchi was homemade, a large serving and delightfully light. We ended with a tiramisu that was the best we've had, there were chocolate shavings that added a great texture and burst of chocolate in the bite.  I can't say enough about this place.  Seriously a fantastic meal, don't miss this gem!~2lovethebeach~Corpus Christi, Texas
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the opportunity to eat dinner at Francesca's.  The restaurant had been recommended to me by a taxi driver as the best Italian in Central New York.  I suspect that he is right.  My appetizer was an arancini di riso.  It was wonderful crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  The sausage in the middle added both flavor and texture.  The tomato sauce was spot on and home made.  My dinner was the veal saltimbocca.  The veal was tender - with just enough sage.  The Marsala gravy was the definition of comfort savory.  All of which was on top of a plate of homemade linguine.  I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  The wait staff was helpful, and the folk in front were friendly and welcoming.  Finally, the wine list was long and reasonably priced.~Robert L~Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I looked at this restaurant as pretty nice from the outside. It had notices about needing reservations, but I walked straight in on a weekday. Then I peeked and saw the outside seating. It was a bit cool but not too bad. Well, it was a little haven in the back. Multi-level, awnings, gas fired tall heaters and a gas fire pit lounge area.    A great sign is the staff were all genuinely happy and worked smoothly with each other. Not all youngsters, but knowledgeable and deft, I enjoyed them.    The food was fabulous. Flavorful, artful, rich, generous. Wine list was a treat and the locale perfect for savoring. I watched the clouds and people with a great Ruffino Chianti, and ordered dessert to prolong the full experience.    Plan ahead or go early, but go.~sunergyvt~Burlington, VT
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was great here, but parking is impossible on weekends & they don't offer to help you.  All I got for an answer when asking our waiter for where to park in the future was, "you have to know the secrets."  It took me 25 min to park - lots of rules in Syracuse (permit parking, 2 hr parking that is full, lot available but always full on weekends, etc., towing from other nearby private lots, etc.).    I called about moving our reservation to a later time & the woman who answered was very snappy.  Even when I originally made the reservation, she was rude.  I get it that they are busy on weekends, but you can say the same thing as quickly without being nasty.    Or waiter clearly wanted to get us in & out of there.  He didn't even offer coffee or dessert at the end of the meal.  Luckily we didn't want any.  The whole meal he gave us the impression that he couldn't be bothered & wished we were younger & hipper.  Buddy, money is money!  The restaurant does book up on weekends so get a reservation early.  It is louder in the back room than the front.    Other than the above, we did like the food & the atmosphere is lively & cozy.  Just don't expect nice service.  That being said, some of the wait staff at other tables seemed to me much more helpful & friendly.  And the bus boy was polite.    Would I go again?  Possibly, but not before trying other area establishments.~HerbyD428~Waterford, VA
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were able to sit outside which is wonderful.  unfortunately, my husband sat down in a chair that was wet!  It was not easily seen as they were metal chairs.  Our server, Michael, was great.  We were disappointed in that my husband ordered a steak and we were told that what was on the menu was not was was being served. He could have onions / peppers if he wanted.  He agreed since we assumed that it could come with it.  Instead, when we received the bill, there was a $7.50 charge for them!!!  There was no mention of this when we ordered.  The food was good, but we ended on a low note because of the bill.~KK K~Syracuse, New York
Francesca's Cucina~735379~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for supper with guest for a conference I was attending.  We were greeted right away and showed to our table which we had reserved.  The waiter was great and very attentive to our questions and needs.  The food was fantastic.  Definitely going to go here again.~kpurvis87~Liverpool, New York
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Again, expect to wait as Franklin Fountain is a popular spot for delicious ice cream treats.  The line winds down the block and again within the store, but worth the wait.  It's nostalgia all the way--step back in time.  The flavors however are not, I had coconut with hot fudge sauce and my husband had house-made seasonal flavor, honeycomb made with booty from the fountain's rooftop hives.~55plustraveler2010~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~By seeing the Man V Food show in the UK I had to visit here. What a treat, even looking in advance at the menue I couldn't decide. The ice creams were Enormous and it ended up being our dinner and desert that night. The staf and shop are decked out to look like an old fashioned shop and it feels authentic. Even in the evening when we visited there was a regular stream of people coming in, we sat outside as wel. The Ice creams was to die for, lots of it and very yummy.~sarahjaneivesane~London
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I order two scoops and is to big. Very good black raspberry and pistacho. There are few seatings outside good enough since nobody stay too long to have an ice cream. $5 a scoop.~Andre O~Miami
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Old time soda fountain that serves the best in ice cream and milk shakes. Only problem is the lines are long cause it's so good.~Kevin M~Newtown Square, Pennsylvania
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our first visit to Franklin Fountain, even though we live relatively close by, was a real treat. After walking along the river at Penn's Landing, we wanted a little something, but not too much of anything. Walking up Market Street, just past Shane's candy store, is Franklin Fountain ice cream shop. Charming. We ordered peach and coconut. The ice cream was wonderfully creamy and dense, with a clean dairy taste. Peach is a hard flavor to come by, and there's has nice pieces of peach in it. I would get it again in a heartbeat. The coconut was equally as good, with enough coconut, but not too much. Tip: if you order a "medium" you can choose two flavors. We did, got an extra spoon, and had our sweet fix on a budget.~Susan K~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Perfectly located in the Old City with a cute outside sitting area. The ice cream tastes good, American style, lovely milkshakes and interesting flavours of ice cream sodas to pick from. At times long lines of people. Rating the value lower, as I consider the ice cream pricey, at the same time the portions are huge. I'd prefer smaller servings for a better price.~GlobalNomad V~Nice, France
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stepping into the Franklin Fountain is like stepping back in time to a day when ice cream was homemade and the service was supreme. I enjoyed the Franklin Mint sundae, which was delicious. It has a small sitting area for eating so they have outdoor tables. It was worth getting chilly to experience.~Linda R~Cottonwood Heights, Utah, United States
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stumbled upon this place while looking for parking on south st while on vac. Very good ice cream with one of kind creations. Very nostalgic little shop it fits its name as i think it was a fountain shop a long long time ago.. Hey when is ice cream ever bad anyways, never haha. Parking may be your only issue..~mrbill33000~Malabar, Florida
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best ice cream I have ever eaten in my life.  I had the Black Raspberry and the Maple Walnut.  So rich and creamy!~Pamala B~Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was actually my second visit here, but since I happened to be in Philly again I thought I should check it out one more time. My impressions this time were pretty much the same as they were on my first visit. This is a novelty ice cream shop with very good ice cream, and a serious price to match. Most of their sundaes are $10-$12, to give you a frame of reference. I have had better ice cream elsewhere, but this was very good. Part of the deal is that this is an old-timey shop, complete with old-time costumes for the soda jerks. It's kind of a fun experience, but there is very limited seating, so it's not really the kind of place where you can go and sit for a while.   It's definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in Philadelphia, but make sure you save up!  Note that they only accept cash!~Josh W~Jackson, Tennessee
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited on a Wednesday around noon, no line, shop was empty. No greeting from the two guys up front at ice cream station, couldn't be bothered, poor customer service.  The girl taking the order was friendly and patiently answered my questions about sodas and ice cream floats. I ordered a root beer float with vanilla ice cream, $8 + 0.64 tax = $8.64 (August 2016); it is 'cash only'. After making payment, was waiting for my float at the front, same terrible attitude from the two guys. Glad to get my drink and leave. Some seating outside.  Quaint shop, small and very narrow; worth a visit if in the area and no line.  Root beer float, pricey but good (make their own root beer).  Bad Attitude from the two guys up front, rude, no manners; don't care for one time tourists, it's like 'people are going to come no matter what'.~shehlee2014~Seoul, South Korea
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited on our last day of our USA holiday, talk about saving the best till last. We all had something different and can happily recommend the Southern Belle, banana split and Mt Vesuvius. The restaurant is very small and brilliant; from the ventilation fan system (electrical engineers will understand), the valve radio, staff uniforms, menu and staff attitude this is the best.~GraemeCoyne~Sandbach, United Kingdom
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What do you get when you combine the best root beer ever and fantastic house-made vanilla ice cream? The best root beer float ever, of course. They make everything in-house, including the root beer. The atmosphere is reminiscent of an old time soda-jerk-place (not sure what you'd call it). Definitely go check it out, even if it's cold out. ~Frank I~Chicago, Illinois
Franklin Fountain~629008~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~so everyone talks about this place and i was like yeah yeah another ice cream parlor whoopee!.  YOU MUST GO HERE i have never in my life had ice cream this wonderful.  i had the caramelized banana ice cream.  HOLY COW it was wonderful.  make sure you go to the candy shop 2 doors down first i think its called shanes, they give you a 10% coupon for the fountain with purchase at the candy store~bumbalough~Nashville, Tennessee
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Based on our two experiences here, this is quickly becoming our favorite spot. This time we came in the late afternoon and there was plenty of seating available. Just a tip - go in the evening when the sun is down and the patio lights are on to get the best atmosphere. If you go before dark, you'll see what I mean. But just as last time, the food was outstanding. We took in an expired Groupon, so I was expecting to get just the purchase price off the meal. But because our bill exceeded a certain price, the manager took off the total original value of the Groupon. Fuego Bistro is a little hard to find, but the hunt is well worth it. Closed Sunday and Monday.~Rick C~Prescott Valley, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Coming from a Guatemalan background, I was very surprised to look on there menu and see a very familiar meal that we eat! It was great knowing that they had a variety and it literally FUEGO!!!~mariahyarbro1997~Phoenix, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fuego Bistro is, without a doubt, my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Each time I've visited, I'm in awe of the ambiance Fuego offers.  The combination of the beautiful patio seating and live music creates an atmosphere like no other.    The menu is unique and delicious. I most recently tried the Pernil Asado. The awesomeness of this slow roasted pork can only be rivaled by a combination of the Phoenix Cardinals winning the Super Bowl and the second coming of Jesus.   The service is exceptional. Each time I have been to Fuego, I've been greeted warmly, and all of the members of the Fuego team provide service which consistently exceeds my expectations.   Eat here. Trust me. You're welcome.~WaitressMary~Glendale, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a nice meal. Rib eye steak was very good and my wife enjoyed her dinner salad. The wait staff is a bit young and inexperienced and it showed in the level of service and professionalism they displayed. Had to ask several times for a water refill and witnessed an argument between two staff members. The entertainment was just ok.  The price was about average. Nothing special.~Mike B~Phoenix, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I asked Siri where the best food near me was after an evening event.  Chase Fuego Bistro from the responses.  It Scores big time.  Wonderful cocktail menu and food complex flavors.  Multiple layers of flavor with definite Latin taste but no specific nationality.  Every bite was done to perfection.   Had a beef my wife had pork. Both excellent.  The atmosphere was exceptional on the patio with smooth music by wonderful solo guitarist  Service was no different. Jesus was our server. Knowledgeable and personal.  Nothing overlooked and everything attended to. ~gemstoneking~Buckeye, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like everything about this place; food, drink, service and atmosphere, which is enjoyable either inside or outside on the patio where there sometimes is live music.~arturo252~Phoenix, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really . . . don't miss enjoying this very cool place; carefree atmosphere; beautiful,live music on the patio; amazing staff servers; and especially creative, delicious cuisine.  This is such a fun and enjoyable experience.~sue8308~Scottsdale, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food here is very flavorful--spicy but not too hot. Very generous portions. I recommend splitting an entree. The sides alone are enough for at least two persons. Not a lover of cornbread but theirs is amazing. Like nothing I have tasted before--slightly sweet with fresh corn. Will return in the future.~JehneRedRocks~Sedona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a quaint place, off the beaten track and peaceful.  The workers are freindly and the restaurant is clean. My favorite dish here are the fish tacos.  They are amazing with different flavors, but always fantastic.~Patti G~Phoenix, Arizona
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was in Phoenix for work and found Fuego Bistro on the next to last night.  The meal was amazing!  Best Latin food we've ever experienced.  The drinks were original, large and delicious.  The empanadas were to die for! Jeff, the owner, stopped at our table and chatted with us before our meal arrived.  Before we left he gave us 5 or 6 restaurant recommendations for our last night.  Experience at Fuego was so great we came back again the next night.  Truly, the best part of our trip to Phoenix and best restaurant we've been to in a long, long time!~Troutish~Vermont
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We decided to visit this restaurant after seeing good reviews here.  We almost missed it as it was tucked between a dance studio. The patio dining was really nice and the staff is so warm and friendly.  There was a dance class going on so you could hear the music and see people swirling around once in a while, but it didn't bother us at all.  The drink menu is next level.  It went on for like 5 pages of the menu and had so many options that looked amazing.  We tried a few through the night and all of them were very well mixed and delicious.  Our food came out fairly quickly once we ordered. I went with a chicken dish, and it was probably the largest chicken breast I've ever seen. It was full of flavor and perfectly cooked. My husband's meal was also really good and he was happy with it.  Mid way through dinner, there was a local band that began playing also.  The food and drinks were excellent here, but the staff is the shining star for me.  Excellent service and friendly people would keep me coming back anytime I'm in Phoenix.~goddess2230~Pennsylvania
Fuego Bistro~777766~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ordered the Latin Feast for our group of 4 - wow, so much food and every bite delicious.  Our only suggestion is that you allow a little bit of time between courses so we can rest and prepare for the next course.~CaseyJ469~Edmonton, Canada
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Garrett's Popcorn is FANTASTIC.  I always get some if I am near one, and most times I have several friends and family that also want some.  Truly a Chicago gem.~Oliviababy2016~Miami Beach, Florida
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Husband and I stopped by while wandering Chicago, because he wanted a treat. We ended up getting cheese and a mix of caramel with nuts. The cheese was good, but the caramel/nut mix was better!   Tip: There was a long line, but it moved pretty fast so don't let that scare you off.  A little pricey, but worth it especially if you get the nut mix!~Lorelai84~Cypress, Texas
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I heard many comments about their popcorn. During my recent visit to Chicago I went to the Navy Pier and tried some... Now I am a fan! I wish they could ship it to Mexico as I am a Groups and Weddings Manager and would love to offer this to our guests. I will visit their stores everytime I visit USA.~Ivonnehux~Huatulco, Mexico
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I travel to Chicago 2 to 3 times a year.  Garretts is a must.  In fact, if friends and coworkers find out I'm coming to Chicago the orders roll in for Garrett's.  I typically visit on the weekends so this means that there will be a line.  I passed by it this last Saturday on our first walk through the mall and there were 3 or 4 people in line.  I came back through an hour later and there were 30 plus people.  The line moves pretty smoothly.  The whole time your mouth is watering and your nose is on overload.  It might be a little pricey, but since this only happens 2 times a year for me it's a must!~Chris M~Evansville, Indiana
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Many locations available downtown.  We visited the location at Water Tower.  Fresh, tasty popcorn!  Get the Chicago Mix (cheddar and caramel)!~Jean B~Mokena
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So I love love the Chicago Mix popcorn from an online vendor called Popcorn Palace. I figure who could do it better than its namesake... Chicago. I was terribly disappointed in all the varieties we purchased. They didn't taste good and they weren't fresh. And the paper bags they provide can even help to preserve the kernels if you have the popcorn more than a day. Don't let the long lines fool you because everyone in line must be first timers like myself... And they most likely won't return. I figure it's a tourist spot and the locals will never return... I won't either. ~Carlihen~Cleveland, Ohio
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped by to pick up a bag after seeing it rated so highly as a thing to do. Was a small line, but did move fast. Got a bag of Chicago mix ( cheese flavor and caramel flavored)  now I love popcorn. Was is the best, no. The cheese flavor leaves you with orange hands (and in my case chin!) kind of like when you eat cheetos, and the caramel flavor had a slight burnt taste to it. And it's GREASY!! You need a napkin or somewhere to wash your hands. But the thing is I couldn't stop eating it. Even though it's not the best I've ever had. I couldn't stop eating the greasy stuff! That's why I have it a 4 it's better than average, but not very good. It's just good. I wouldn't buy it again. But you got to try it once. ~jettsgal~Vancouver, Canada
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We get popcorn for a souvenir every time we visit Chicago, and we buy some for others too.  Sooooo good.  Our kids loved the cheddar, but the Garrett mix is always a classic Chicago fav. Highly suggest you get in line before they open.  ~lindsaylur~Holland, Michigan
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We love this popcorn!! This is the second time my husband and I have been to Chicago and we would not miss Garrett's. We even brought an extra bag home of Garett mix.  Worth every penny!!~Kristina D~London
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We loved Garrett's actually brought some back for friends and family. It didn't last very long! Worth the lines to get some good popcorn!~robrely2002~Kissimmee, Florida
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried the Garrett Mix that combines "sweet Caramel Crisp with savory CheeseCorn". We didn't really like them but thought that it was a must-try thing in Chicago, I would recommend buying a small bag and sharing it! We had to wait for 10-15 min to get them, as there was quite large queue!~gloriavallfor~Troy, New York
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When only the best well do . .ya gotta go to Garretts. . Carmel corn and their mix is a Chicago thang . .get some.~Todd A~Seattle
Garrett Popcorn Shops~2500912~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever I visit Chicago, this is my one must do thing!  Whether you like caramel corn (my favorite) or the Garrett's mix (cheese and caramel) or plain or butter or caramel with nuts, it is just so darn addictive!  You smell it before you see it and then wait in the line because it is joy in your mouth!~Herb I~Danville, Pennsylvania
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always a pleasure to visit Gerber's. Staff are friendly and accommodating. The crowd and atmosphere are welcoming and the food is off the charts. ~JAR6853~Utica, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyable friendly "old time" atmosphere of the mid-1900's.  Service is friendly and fairly speedy -- it's NOT "fast food" style -- so it's not like a drive-thru -- meals are individually prepared,  Menu is limited to a modest selection of fairly simple food.  Pricing is very reasonable.~James C~Utica, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Gerber's is truly unique for Utica. I would have to argue it is unique for anywhere else I've ever been as well. It is quaint, small, the menu relatively limited, but the food you eat will resonate on your palate and in your mind for its unique quality.    What makes Gerber's unique is the feeling of stepping back into the 1930's. Some of the displays within have a museum quality to them, but it works,   As you step in the door, your attention will be brought to the long bar. I was immediately pleased with a solid selection of draft beers. The tables are set up along the length of the bar. The staff is welcoming as you enter, the step back in time is solidified by period music, brought into the digital age, but sourced from 78's found in the building by the owner. It's a pleasurable step back in time and what defines Gerber's as Gerber's.  The food is basic, but carefully prepared to perfection. Although the menu does change; standards on the menu include: Fried Bologna with long hots (it's great, I've had it) and Angus Beef Aux Just (my Gerber's favorite), Grilled Cheese and Hot Pastrami on Rye.  I find I have places that I enjoy during certain times of the year. Gerber's is kind of tucked way in the Downtown area. It resonates with me best on summer nights, like some hidden secret speakeasy in the night and that's when I find my way there.  It's a tad pricey for what it is; but in the long run it is so worthwhile. The uniqueness of the experience seems to beg for a return visit. ~bryan377~Barneveld, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great find!   We pulled up in front and almost left because it looked a little sketchy. We were looking for a quick bite to eat.  An interesting little place that used to be a speakeasy during prohibition.  A short menu with good choices. We had the "gerb" a warm sandwich filled with a whole lot of meat......wonderful,  and a bowl of coconut carrot soup.....amazing.  Nice selection of beers as well. The owner was there and gave us the history of the area. So glad we stopped in! ~spinmath64~New Hampshire
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, good prices, historic building restored with care. They now have outside tables. Just off Genesee street downtown We all ordered the specials and were very pleased  Small tavern atmosphere,worth visiting ~Nancy34091~Bonita Springs, Florida
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I liked the quaintness and woodwork in the renovated speakeasy.   The food was really good and the bread pudding was exceptional.   I find myself not going there simply because they don't post a daily menu anywhere.    I got tired of calling on the phone and asking what they were serving that particular night.   The daily specials are limited and sometimes they just didn't appeal to my tastes.  They have a Facebook page, but don't consistently post updates there either.    If you like an intimate setting and want to call ahead to see what is on the menu,  I encourage you to check this place out.~yeahmon2016~Syracuse, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this place. It is a great place for lunch and especially nice for a late dinner. When it is crowded at night, it has a definite NYC buzz about it. Although limited, the menu is varied and the food is great!~677PatriciaK677~Utica, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a genuine, restored 1930s tavern and if you went to Gerber's in the 1950s or 1960s or you've never been at all, it's a great place for a friendly bar and great food. The specials for dinner are always perfectly prepared. On the lunch menu, there are four or five standards -- the same food you might have had in the 1930s -- with lunch specials offered as well. We always look forward to our visits! It's the perfect place to relax and make friends.~RonL40~Utica, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice bar/ restaurant. Everyone i our party loved their meal. Meatloaf on Tuesdays is great. We will be back again before the Comet hockey games.~herovb~Upstate New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recently stayed in Utica for business and decided to try Gerbers 1933 Tavern out.  Have eaten at many of the restaurants in south end of Utica and New Hartford.  Most were formal restaurants. This time I was looking for a relaxing casual pub experience. Gerbers definately delivered. Upon entering I noticed the Jazz music playing (bonus) at an appealing volume. The decor and framed images make you believe Gerbers exists in a time long ago. I sat at the long bar and was promptly greeted by Daryyl the bartender. He was professional and friendly. Gerbers offers approximately 8 beers on draft and a full bar. The menu was being reworked and will soon be offering a hummus appetizer & Veggie burgers for meatless variety. Although limited they offer sandwiches, burgers, roast beef au jus and dinners including specials such as NY strip, Rib eye. I for opted for a side salad, Reuben sandwich and bread pudding. Everything is made to order and the quality speaks for itself.  The prices are reasonable and I definitely will return and recommend Gerbers.~Dave D~Canandaigua, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our first visit to this tavern. Based on some of the reviews we decided to try it. The place is rather small but the staff is very friendly and is pleased to share the history of the establishment which dates back to before the Prohibition era. Our party ordered drinks and sandwiches and were enjoyed by all. Food was plentiful but rather slow from order to table. Definitely would return!~swimmers~New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was looking for a little old Utica that my Pop talked about! The establishment feels the part but doesn't commit to the sale!!! The food was ok but my expectations were so much higher! The owner was overbearing but very nice! I would go again in awhile.~Eissensday~New Hartford, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate dinner here tonight and it was outstanding! The owner is an awesome person and he goes above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying yourself. The food was delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere is also great! This was our second time here for dinner and we love it! We will definitely be back and we definitely reccomend it here!~Shannon K~Utica, New York, USA
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a fantastic lunch at Gerber's.  Wandered in during our walk and thoroughly enjoyed the service and history talk with the owner and our sever. Great draft beer selection and The Tavern Special Fried Bologna Sandwich was wonderful.~Leforge~Belleville, Ontario
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went in for a beer and stayed for dinner. Reuben and potato salad were great! I had a shrimp pasta with feta and olives special which was very good. You have to save room for the bread pudding!!Also good service and nice atmosphere.~802pegasus~Utica, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in town for an event and decided to stop by the tavern. We were greeted by a gracious hostess and a great, refreshing, cold Saranac beer. The tavern has been lovingly restored to it's original appearance and it is a gem!   After a delicious hummus appetizer and another drink we went off to explore the city.~189chrisandbarb~Hillburn, New York
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying at the Hotel Utica just around the corner and stopped in for a cocktail.  Staff was pleasant and took good care of all their customers. We did not have any food, but they do have a menu and serve food.  This bar has a lot of history and goes back before prohibition and supposedly had been a speak easy.  Note the bar, one plank for the entire length and it slopes towards the bartender.  So if you spill a drink it will flow away from you.  Tin ceilings  and many original decorations. Really friendly bartenders and just a great stop for a cocktail of a beer.~Roger A~Ocala, Florida
Gerber's 1933 Tavern~4475857~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've eaten here on several occasions during our visit to the area and have never been disappointed. The staff is always friendly and the owner always makes sure he stops by the table for a chat. The meatballs with long hots are our favorite.. fried bologna sandwich with long hots are even better. ~BellaNewYork~New York
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great night at Gibsons steakhouse. Had a great dinner with friends. Steak was very good, service was ok hence the 4 stars.  It is an icon in Chicago and worth the visit.  ~Lovetravelall~Fairfax, Virginia
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I debated for quite some time which steakhouse to choose on a recent trip to Chicago. I finally decided in Gibsons. I had a five o'clock reservation and arrived a few minutes early. I was led directly to my table with no wait. My server was very personable and professional. I thought I must have just gotten lucky, but as I heard other servers nearby I realized that their entire staff was just as knowledgeable and friendly. The cut of meat (bone-in ribeye) was fantastic and tender although could have used a little more seasoning for my taste. The Gibson's seasoning salt on the table took care of that however. I was in, had a great meal with terrific service and back out within an hour.~Bruce J~Pembroke, Virginia
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the Muscles for appetizers and it was great, great flavor in a red sauce . Had the steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. ...mouth watering. The asparagus was cooked to my perfection it still had some crispness to it. The steak I had Medium so pink it melted in my mouth~RDJennnings~Iuka, Illinois
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the rib steak ..amazing My wife had the sea bass - wonderful  I have been coming here once a year for 15+ years , this is a timeless spot - great food, amazing ambiance , professional service . just a 10/10 every time . ~JFYUL~Montreal, Canada
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I heard a lot about Gibsons before I went. My boss is a steak fanatic and he told me this is the best steakhouse in the country. On a family trip to Chicago, we finally decided to try Gibsons out. What a joyful meal... The service was excellent which is different from some of the other upscale (or the owners think it's upscale) steakhouses. We ordered some appetizers to share, the insalata caprese was amazing, fresh tomatos, great quality cheese and excellent olive oil/vinegar. For steak, we wanted to order porterhouse and fillet to share. The manager recommended to try their "Chicago" cut steak in lieu of fillet and we took his recommendation. That was an excellent choice. We thought the Chicago cut was actually better the porterhouse. I enjoy good quality steaks but I can't really say that I am an expert. I am not professional enough to make a statement such as "this is the best steakhouse in the country". However, for all the nice steak restaurants I have been to, the Benjamin in NYC, Pappas Bros. in Houston and the Gibsons in Chicago are definitely the top three in my experience.~Vince_Huang~Atlanta, Georgia
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was excited to eat here because so many people talked about it. I had this fish soup that was pretty good. I love the vibe and would return. Packed every night.~MaryAnne S~New York City, New York
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Looks like old-style Chicago although it's only 28 years old. Excellent steaks cooked to perfection! Friendly service. ~Wildcatbr~Rio De Janeiro
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~No bread when we sat down. Didn't think anything of it until I saw another table getting bread. We were already done with our meal so I wasn't about to ask for bread at that point. I like a good fresh bread so I was disappointed. Maybe the other table requested it, idk.   I had salmon which was really good. Wife had 10 oz filet mignon. She liked it.   The sides are huge. I wish they were smaller that way you could try more of them. Two sides are too much for two people. We had a lot left over and couldn't box it up since we're from out of town. ~CallMrPlow~Southgate, Michigan
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Cubs were playing away in the World Series, so we able to get a great table. Top notch waiter (a friend of Elvis) and service was top notch. The filets, New York Strip and Prime Rib were all perfectly done, serviced in generous proportions.. all prime cuts. A must stop while in Chicago~Richard J~Baltimore, Maryland
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The steaks at Gibson's are always perfectly aged and prepared. The Chicago cut bone in ribeye is the choice. Well marbled and textured. The outside is seared to give a sweet crust and texture.  I normally ordered medium rare and the temperature was perfect. ~highwoodkevin~Highwood
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was recommended by several friends who have been to Chicago We loved it Food was fantastic, make sure you are hungry as the servings are not for the faint hearted Steaks were outstanding, wine was well marched The table next to us had a mountain for dessert and kindly gave us a tasting plate The Art Deco building is also worth seeing We really enjoyed our evening here ~Sue J~Sydney, Australia
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unfortunately I cant remember his name but it was unanimous amongst our group of 7 guests that he was the best waiter any of us had ever had. Understated professionalism that was refreshing and made a very nice meal (Great steaks) so much more memorable. The meal capped off a great week to be in this fantastic city. he was kind enough to offer us a small piece of cake for desert (see photo attached) The restaurant was busy and it looked like every body was having the same experience as we did. Cant recommend a visit highly enough~Peter H~Greater London, United Kingdom
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~WOW. Awesome in all regards. Hosted business meal for 125 folks. The service and food was top notch. I had steak and Lobster. But many had the Sea Bass and said it was fantastice~montanabill2016~Kalispell, Montana
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a tremendous dining experience!!  It all started with our waiter arriving with a tray filled with raw steak. He educated us about all the available cuts....and then some!!! He belongs on Saturday Night Live. The filet mignon is like butta!!!!  Be sure to order the double baked potato!!  One served our entire group of five. The desserts are outstanding. It's worth ordering the chocolate cake just to see what it looks like. Don't miss this place!!!!~maimogirl~Montreal, Canada
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went there after another place across the street made us wait and then didn't give us a table.  That was the best thing that could have happened to us.  Everything about Gibsons was perfect.  The drinks were delicious and the food was amazing.  Our steaks were perfect, some of the best we have ever had.  Our waitress was so nice and professional.  The only way this could have been better was if they would have picked up the check.  I am already looking forward to my next visit to Chicago to return to Gibsons.~jfidalg0~Nanuet, New York
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse~455964~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here with our son for his birthday celebration . Staff  very good and food was superb definitely recommend.~Rosedub~County Dublin, Ireland
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After our first dish we worked to gain a second reservation. Unfortunately it did not happen. I'm so happy with my overall experience. My wife chose this restaurant. Thank you!  A comfortable restaurant with great drinks, food and service. We had a fun night.~Ed T~Toronto
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Celebrated our daughter's birthday here with 10 of her friends and we couldn't have chosen a better place. It was an amazing experience! The atmosphere was hip, cool, noisy (but not obnoxiously so), exciting and all around just fun. You might cringe at the idea of eating goat empanadas, duck tongue and pig face, but let me tell you that they were all very, very good. My experience with some of these foodie places with celebrity chefs is its mostly hype but quite lacking taste-wise, but that was not the case in this restaurant. The dishes were all flavor-packed, starting with their delicious breads with flavored butters(we tried all three kinds and we all agreed that the best was the johnny apple cheese), to their amazing appetizers (fried shishito peppers, hamachi crudo, goat empanadas, calamari bruschetta were the best), to the main courses (the famous oven roasted pig face is worthy of its fame, bucatini was so flavorful, and my husband is still dreaming of the braised beef tongue and the braised pork shank), and finally their desserts (we tried them all and best is still the popcorn and malted balls). Best of all, the service was impeccable and on point. Our party had a mix of vegan, vegetarian, ovo-vegetarian, to downright just very picky (our daughter), but we were all very happy and full at this dinner! Our server gave excellent recommendations and was so nice and cheerful to our large party of 12!    It does require advanced planning to go to this place (we booked our table for 12 six months in advance), but we figured there must be a reason why its so popular. We were seated at a large table by the kitchen and it was awesome. Our daughter is still thanking us for her "perfect" birthday dinner!    Lastly, for such a famous restaurant in downtown Chicago the price was surprisingly reasonable. For the ambiance, service, food, and value, definitely five stars!~faith840~Fairfax, Virginia
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious selection and food is perfect for sharing.  I've dined here several times and the food, service and atmosphere are stellar.~Alana S~Boston, Massachusetts
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First I'll say I was spoiled by getting the Chef's table that is the counter spot in front of the open kitchen. This is why my experience was extraordinary.  I will say that the food was beyond. The descriptions on the menu made me a bit weary at first but our server was more than comforting when making our choices when ordering. Each dish was  brought out in perfect order allowing us to taste and enjoy each one alone or as a pairing. My recommendations would be the Roasted Pig Face and the Roasted Beets that are on the standard menu. Then, I was lucky enough to have an item on their specials menu... Escargot Ravioli. The Ravioli in my opinion should be on the menu FOREVER!! I could eat this and only this if I could pick it my last meal...THAT good. I highly recommend you try this restaurant, I do not think it will disappoint.~Cynthia R~Chicago, Illinois
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great cocktail menu (see photo), fun ambiance, and amazing food.  We loved the calamari bruschetta, cruspy pork shoulder, mushroom pierogies with blue cheese, and chickpea fritters.~Vrsol~Portland, Oregon
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I haven't been to Chicago in 2 years and when I asked my friend where we should go to dinner he said "Girl and the Goat"- hands down. I went with great expectations, which were mostly met.  We had made reservations more than 1 month in advance and were seated promptly.  Cocktails are delicious and service is on point.  The menu changes seasonally but they always have the goat dishes, which you must try.  The pate was delicious!  A must try place if you are in the area!~Tiffany M~San Francisco, California
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was on business in Chicago two weeks ago   When I walk around Restaurant ally a person saw me looking at this restaurant and highly suggested a try it.  Well I started with the House wine very nice surprised my pallet at first taste.  Then I had green beans in a fish sauce hope they cary it in heaven  follows by fried duck tongues sounds disgusting was great sorry ducks   after that pig cheeks oh boy I would eat this everyday!  followed by Goat which made me curious was much better then lamb  last I had a desert and rolled back to my hotel.  I eat like I just discovered food you must try this place.~JRD52~Boisbriand, Canada
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was there with a friend and as I was told the waiting list was of at least 2 hours so my friend and I decided to share the sofa area with other couples and that was perfect. The place is fun, alive, active, the attention was excellent and the food was amazing.~eridaniaalvarez~Santo Domingo
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last night was our 50th Wedding Anniversary.  Ladies make your own reservations and take care of yourself.  You cannot get a table here unless you book several weeks/months in advance.  So, we had cocktails here and ate at the Goat Diner.  The place is dark but the bar is typical Chicago homey friendly people, the drinks are pricey, Martini's $20.00.  Wine was nice and I wish I would have taken with, a nice red Pinot.  I saw two couples seated at the bar bisecting the Kitchen which is open.  So, we did get a whiff of flavor every so often.  Off to the Diner.~maryjeanne1942~Ingleside, Illinois
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Never thought I would be trying some of the food combinations I enjoyed tonight.  We were a party of 6 and between us we tried at least 10 different dishes.  Everything was amazing.  This was truly a dining adventure and our server was wonderful in guiding through our selections.  Excellent food, fun environment.  Great night.~PayneFamily4~Plantation, Florida
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a recent visit to Chicago we tried this place on a whim with no reservations.  When we hit there it was a 1.5hr wait, but the bar was first come first served.  We were lucky to get 3 seats at the bar and sat immediately.   The service was friendly and professional. Our sever made recommendations and helped us choose some of our dishes. This restaurant is family style dinning, which I like, it gives me the opportunity to try more things!  I was not sure what to expect when we chose this place, but I was surprised, the food is excellent.  The kitchen timed our dishes so that the lighter tasting dishes came out first and the stronger bolder tasting dishes came later.    All the dishes we had were excellent!  We had the beets, shard, red fish in curry, green beans and the pork shank!   All delicious!  I would highly recommend giving Girl & the Goat a try. I know I will go again the next time I am in Chicago. ~SpiritofPlace~Ft. Lauderdale
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We didn't have a reservation but our daughter got there soon after it opened and somehow we got a booth if we agreed to be done by 730 on a busy Friday night. Thank you to the host and hostess! Everything is served family or tapas style to share. Favorite dishes were the sea bass and dessert ice cream with caramel corn and chocolate shell. The breads with different types of butter, smoked broccoli and empanadas were also good. We shared a medium priced bottle of white French wine. The atmosphere is wonderful and everyone seems to be having a good time. ~DinerIndiana~Williamsburg
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We took a chance. We had no reservations. (There is a month or more wait but they take walk- ins). D A party of six? Timing is everything and we were seated immediately at a low table surrounded onto sides by a couch and two stools on the third side. It was in the corner by the window overlooking the city sidewalk. Perfect!, actually added to the ambiance. The restaurant is decorated as a hip,contemporary space that adds to the energy. Many goat dishes, but fish, beef, and vegetables as well.. Order as small,plates to share. The server suggested two each- we struggled at the end and did not touch the piece de resistance - the goat shank. ( I took it to the hotel and ate it the net night and room temp. While watching the last game of the World Series. Did not disappoint!) the chef, Stefanie Izard was a winner on "Top Chef". fourth season. She is a very talented chef. I recommend this restaurant to anyone. I would come back in a heart beat. Just remember those small plates add up.. Especially when the server assures you he can add on to accommodate the number in the party!   ~DDB51~Poway, California
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried to get reservations online but in many cases they were booked up 6 months in advance.  We got there 20 minutes before it opened, waited in line and snagged a spot at the bar.  The doors were open and the wait staff was a little annoyed that we walked in early and were told to leave and come back at 430pm.  If we had done that we would have had to wait an hour for a seat.  So get in line.    The food was as advertised.  We shared 4 dishes between the 2 of us plus a dessert and we were stuffed.  The bar staff was awesome and most of the dishes were good.  My favorite was the calamari bruschetta - it was great.~rwgrncrd~Michigan
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were so exited to snag a table here on our first trip to Chicago. Being industry professionals, chef and server, we love trying new places and loved the look of this menu. Our experience here was not a good one. From the servers halitosis to the lacklustre food where do I begin? Our arrival was greeted with a blank stare by 4 hostesses chatting at the front door. Our arrival at our table was quick and efficient by our server who was extremely friendly, but as I mentioned earlier needed a breath mint badly! We ordered and I left briefly to use the washroom, by the time I returned 2 plates were already on our table. I totally understand that dishes arrive at the table when they are ready, but 3 minutes after ordering? How fresh is that? The dishes we ordered were described as sharing plates, not tapas. They weren't, both dishes were exceptionally small, except for the veggie plate which was ridiculously huge!  We sat for about 10 minutes with a huge plate of charred broccoli, but nothing to eat with it. By the time the last dish came the broccoli was cold. The dishes we ordered did not taste bad at all, they just were so tiny and lacked that something that would have made them great. They were just ok. Immediately after the last dish left the table we felt so rushed into either ordering dessert or leaving.  By the time we arrived to out the door it was under an hour. I love sharing plates, tapas, and this style of restaurant usually, but that night they totally missed the mark with us.  I would highly recommend you carefully read and ask a lot of questions about the menu items when you order and maybe stagger your order so you aren't stuck with a massive plate of charred broccoli.~CountyKat17~Picton, Canada
Girl & The Goat~1892177~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~pig face and duck tongue - not seen them on a menu before! But the food was very nice and the service very good. It is a busy and loud place - but friendly and enjoyable. Not an intimate romantic venue but was fun and would be good for a small group.~Kevin-and-Jo~Hamilton, New Zealand
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After reading Danny Meyer's book, I decided to make a reservation. Everything was perfection, from the arrival to the end. The service, the ambience, the quality of the food and flavors, the meals presentation, and the overall flow of the dining experience. The wine list is large. We are from Argentina so in general is difficult to make a decision about US or European wines when we travel, as every restaurant has different options. We selected a bottle of wine that we enjoyed very much.  Everything Danny Meyer explained on Setting the Table was reflected at this restaurant. I mentioned about it to the servers while dining. All personnel made an excellent job. It was so good that we went back the night after to the other side of the restaurant to try the a la carte option, and one more time, everything was excellent. I recommend this restaurant, either for the five course dinner or for a more casual experience.~moonstoneBA~buenos aires
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here for mother-in-law's birthday dinner. It was six adults and one child. We went for the 3 course meal and had a mix of: Beef Tartare, Celery Soup, Kale Salad, Crab and Corn, Striped Bass, Lamb, and Pork Loins for appetizers and entrees. For dessert, all of us had some variation of cake with a custard: mango, chocolate, etc.    The waiters and waitresses were vigilant, on-time, and were attentive. However, having been used to dining in countries like Japan and Korea where such service is a norm almost everywhere, it was more of a taken-for-granted kind of thing for us, but there were a lot of diners around us commenting on the "impeccable service". I guess it's a cultural thing... so if you're used to waiters and waitresses looking at cellphones and chatting with other co-workers, not taking care of you every second and minute you're there-- you will feel like a King or a Queen at this restaurant.  In any case, service was excellent by all American standards. The food was OK. For a $900 meal, I guess I expected something more spectacular. All the dishes that we had were similar to four star hotel in-room dining food. Most of the items on the menu are just that: Striped Bass, Black Bass, Lamb Chops, Pork Loins, etc... cooked in a manner like you would get at any nice hotel. So I was a bit puzzled by one reviewer's comment on diversity while dining here. It just seemed like simple American style cuisine cooked well. Personally, the tartare could've used a quail egg, the bass could've used some caviar or other egg-type sprinkling to give it a boost, and the meat... it was just meat.  I think if rustic, pottery barn style decor, and traditional food is your thing-- kind of like having a good, expensive Thanksgiving meal-- this is the place for you.  Maybe if we had gone with the Seasonal Course instead of the recommended 3-course for the night, we might have had a different experience. All-in-all for $900 for 6 adults and 1 child that only ate the pre-meal bread... I just felt like we had better options. Mother-in-law and the rest of the family did enjoy it, so it was all good. Most likely would return if with a group of non-adventurous diners.~Jae Y~Sterling, Virginia
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a fantastic lunch here last week.  Both the seasonal and vegetarian tasting menus were wonderfully thought out and very delicious. Great wine list. Good service and reasonably priced for the standard of fare.  One of the best meals I've had in a long time........really!!!  Look forward to going back and have no hesitation in recommending.~Maria T~Sevenoaks, United Kingdom
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Honestly ! The best delights I tried in a long time. They are serving excellent tasty menu that will not disappoint you. The restaurant has a very inviting atmosphere with nice decor. The waiters are very professional and knowledgeable. They would help to make your choice or happy to suggest options. However I would like mention some details about my experience. I travel a lot solo, it is the nature of my job. I also go out to launch, dinner alone most of the time. My waiter was fantastic; he was very friendly and helpful, but there were couple of things that I think could have been done better. He didn't tell me about the specials of the day, or describe the menu ( there was a couple next to me, and he was very enthusiastic to explain them all the details and was giving " the attention ").He just brought to me one piece of bread without butter. When I asked for it, they happily brought to the table. It's small details but important when coming to a place like this. I had oysters, a heavenly delicious burger, just an orgasmic chocolate cake and a glass of white wine. I payed 80 $. Gramercy it is a wonderful place to indulge yourself and should keep the standards regardless. Other than that, I can't wait to go back! ~Tzupy29~Dubai, United Arab Emirates
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are looking for a great dinner in a great setting, this is the place. Service, food, wine list, everything is top notch. The most important I guess is the attention given to the details throughout the diner experience which is we must admit a very important part of the experience. We were located in the dinning room which offers a different menu but also a different atmosphere. Would go again! Highly recommend!!! ~runtown72~Montreal, Canada
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My party of four dined there two weeks ago.  Three of us had eaten at this restaurant several times previously with good results.  However, this time was a big disappointment.  Two in our party ordered chicken dishes which came out cold.  After returning them, they came out cold a second time.  Not what we would expect from this restaurant.  Very disappointed.~Hiram A~Mesa, Arizona
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The ambiance? Gorgeous! The service? Impeccable! The food? Divine!!! With two different course choices, we chose the smaller of the two; and we were completely satiated by the end of this most delicious dinner. We had an 8 PM reservation and when we left at 10:30, any empty table was filled immediately! And this was a weekday, so advise to all is to book your reservations as soon as you know your plans! The Manager took extra care to stop by and make sure everything was to satisfaction; no worries there...~kmormlo~Sarasota, Florida
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The flavours, combinations and presentation of the food were all excellent. I went for "double lamb" (lamb strozzapretti to start, lamb loin and shoulder for main), both were rich and bursting with flavour. My wife had th same main but had the crab and corn to start - so light and delicate but still full of flavour. The pear and walnut buckle for dessert was gorgeous. When considering ordering, the blue cheese custard almost out me off ordering that dessert but a pear sorbet beautifully balanced it out. The room decor is lovely and the staff were excellent - knowledgeable, engaging but very professional. Recommend!~Brian L~London, United Kingdom
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited for my husbands 50th birthday on Halloween.  Excellent service from our waiter, Stephen. His knowledge of wine pairings for our taster menu was perfect balancing our usual wine choices carefully recommending local NY state wines and a fabulous Brooklyn Brewery dark chocolate stout paired with a chocolate desert. We would never have chosen that but it was divine.  All the staff from arrival through the bar and the serving staff were attentive  And the food... perfect! We had the seasonal taster menu and would highly recommend! ~Julie B~Norwich, United Kingdom
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for the seasonal tastings menu option along with matching wine selections. Beautifully presented by attentive and knowledgeable staff. Great taste and unusual blending of ingredients. We all enjoyed the food, wine and sense of occasion and felt thoroughly spoiled!~dcjtrips~Cirencester, United Kingdom
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well deserved reputation for fine dining.  Excellent dining experience from the delicious food; the menu is prix fixe; one section is a la carte, one seasonal tasting menu and one vegetarian tasting menu.  The server told us it was not obligatory for the entire table to have the tasting menu if only one wanted it which was great...even though as she warned some food would be ready before another's course; this was not an issue for us and so two had a la carte, one had the seasonal tasting and one the vegetarian.  Everyone was delighted with their choices.  This was the best dining experience both in terms of food and service we've had in a long time.  The only thing that would have topped it would be a more cozy dining ambiance..seemed a little spartan and perhaps too well lit.  The parting gift of Gramercy Tavern granola bars was novel; they are delicious by the way.~natmicstef~Caribbean
Gramercy Tavern~424094~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to the tavern for a late lunch. Food, service and ambience was exceptional. Would recommend to anyone looking for quality food and service in a beautiful setting to go to Gramercy Tavern. Guaranteed to impress.~Nicholas_AU~Melbourne
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food and service, especially the bartenders. Loved the coffee bar. The wait was well worth it and the sitting at the bar for dinner was great~johnii1958~Cincinnati, Ohio
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Gran Caffe L'Aquila is a gem. Besides excellent food, the wait staff is very knowledgeable and takes the time to go over the menu. We had a few small plates and one entree, plenty of food for three, especially with the generous serving of bread and olive oil served first. We had the Gnocchi, Melanzana Parmigiana and the Veal Saltimboca. All were outstanding.The restaurant roasts its own coffee and makes its own gelato so naturally we had dessert. I chose the caffe gelato to get both their homemade confection and their house roasted coffee all at once. Delicious! In a city with many very good restaurants, this one should be high up on the list.~Stephanie G~Ashland, Massachusetts
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Group of 6 - had variety of items from menu. Everything from wine, to appetizers, main dishes, and gelato were prepared to please visually and palate. Service was attentive and friendly.~Suz1884~Grants Pass, Oregon
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The interior is modern yet charming.  Lots of great wines and mixed drinks, and a revolving, interesting list.  They have mostly smaller plates for sharing, but a few larger plates as well.  The 4 of us tried many dishes, and loved them all.  Then, we did the homemade gelato sampler as our dessert along with a few variations of the house-roasted coffee, and they were magnificent.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable--she told us the story of the 2 Italian chefs, and gave fabulous recommendations.  I even went back the next morning for a cup of the heavenly coffee!~Stephanie W~Atlanta, Georgia
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great find for people who like their Italian food done in a manner that reminds one of dining in Italy. Portions are not monster sized. The emphasis is on quality, not quantity. So it is probably best to order a couple a dishes apiece (or more if one is ravenous) and share among the diners. Care is taken with each dish so even the most humble offering is fresh and packed with taste.For those legions who favor gelato, the restaurant makes its own and it is a dessert hard to resist. Moreover it is one of the few places awash with so much poor American coffee where you can get a decent cup to finish off your meal. The restaurant is surprisingly large with two floors on offer. I would also have to commend the very knowledgeable and helpful service. Not cheap but still great value for what you pay.~cfreedma~Sydney, Australia
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a little Italian gem in the heart of Philadelphia. The food is good and recalls the real Italian national tradition and in particular from Abruzzo region. Nice and  friendly staff , could be a bit more attentive but overall good service.  We walked in without booking and they accommodated us immediately. Suggestions : find a car park and leave the car there ; then walk to the restaurant.~daisy742014~London, United Kingdom
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This must be the most authentic and best Italian restaurant we have ever visited outside of Italy! Maybe we were just striking lucky with everything: The food, the atmosphere, the service, the Italian charm, the wine, and the food again; or, maybe this is how the Gran Caffe L'Aquila really is every day? We would love to find out, and we will definitely be back!~wilhelmm-norway~Oslo, Norway
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took a group of ten students on a conference trip and chose Gran Caffe for a group meal. Fast, friendly service. Excellent food. The gelato is fabulous so save room. Try the house specialties with savory gelato on top. ~Donna R~San Antonio
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came across this restaurant on a rainy Sunday when visiting Philly. It was a great find. The waiter was attentive, offering opinions and description regarding menu items. He recommended the beef braised in Barolo and it was absolutely amazing! I am not sure if I have ever had more tender meat than this and so flavorful. The wine was lovely, the house made gelato delicious. I can imagine this place being very busy on weekend evenings. The previous evening we had eaten at an old school 1950s era Italian restaurant. While good, not in the same league as this place. We will definitely return.~morocco79~Rockville, Maryland
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a group of seven dine at this restaurant for a business dinner on a Friday night. Our reservation was somehow lost but the manager fit us in within five minutes after we showed our confirmation.   Our group shared many small plates, and everyone agreed that it was one the best Italian dining experiences that we had every had. The gelato was also amazing and the wine reasonably priced and good.   The service was also outstanding. Ask for a second floor table if you want to be able to hear better.   I will definitely be back. ~andydeerisle~Deer Isle, Maine
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We luckily got a table on the first floor on a busy Sat evening. The place was buzzing and everyone was happy. We ordered three plates and dessert and all were divine. Our server, Jordyn, was perfect as well. I would most highly recommend you try this place. ~Carol R~Tucson, Arizona
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked there for lunch and what a treat it was! We shared a few small plates and appetizers, and then had a *perfect* cappuccino and a cannoli. I highly recommend it!~Marina V~Blacksburg, Virginia
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went there for dinner. Food was good.Service can be improved. Had to wait for my server to come around for more than 5 minutes, even when he passed by. Atmosphere is casual and upbeat. The Octopus appetizer was good.~Rubymommy~New Jersey
Gran Caffe L'Aquila~7385575~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With great restaurants, I am always torn in TripAdvisor ratings between the 4 or 5 circles. I usually decide based on whether dining there is a special, high quality and unique event, almost regardless of price.   Gran Caffe L'Aquila is special.   This restaurant originally resided at the Piazza D'Uomo in the capital of the Abruzzo region (Of Italy, of course) and it was a hot spot there until it was tragically destroyed in the earthquake of 2009. Undeterred, the owners transported the venue (using original fixtures and materials salvaged from the Italian locale) to duplicate, as closely as possible, the original Cafe. They did so in partnership with Riccardo Longo, the renowned Philly restauranteur.   I give Corrina, our server, a great deal of the credit for making this such a unique event. She took us expertly through the menu and suggested splendid pairings of wine and food and (later) pairings of the award winning Gelato. In addition to the elaborate and highly creative regular food options (which include small plates as well as main courses) the chef offers a weekly menu devoted to a different section of Italy each time (Siena this trip), again with exquisite wine and food pairings from the region.   I will not over-describe the complete menu in this review because unlike more conventional restaurants, part of the adventure here is in allowing the server to guide you through the meal. (if you don't like surprises, you can look up the menus on the web site, but I guarantee if you like Italian, you will have much variety from which to choose.) And, of course, you can decide to select independently without the guidance of the server...but why?.     As an ordinary type guy, I ordered the Bologna/Roasted Peppers/ Panini on baguette, which was delicious and anything but ordinary. The roasted peppers alone (also available as a side) are worth the visit.   Barbara (my wife and erstwhile dining companion) had the Salumi Sushi and Parpadelle A Ragu ( Ragu made of pork, veal, lamb and chicken that just had fallen from the bone). Don't let the "Sushi" moniker bother you...the wrap is an excellent and delicate salami and inside are pine nuts, rice, cheeses etc. The dish is served with a dollop of marmalade  and a drizzle of a really good sauce. Of course, I shared Barbara's courses liberally and she didn't hesitate to (delicately) tear into my Panini.   Our stable was adjacent to the glassed-in gelato bar where we had the privilege of seeing the owner happily concocting his award winning gelato...a must for dessert.   One very small quibble (always must be one, right?) I'd lose the Italian pop music being played during the meal. Silence or more elegant music would suit this restaurant.   Prices on food and drinks were relatively high, but not at all unreasonable for high-end Philadelphia.  I hope this place keeps up its quality and stays here for a long time.~TommyBoy94~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Downtown Portland in a very central area close to the museum and theaters and concert hall. Two different dining rooms both with pleasant and confortable decors. Excellent service and good cuisine. However some suggestions for improvements : paper tablecloth not in phase with this type of restaurant, service great but slightly overdoing it, good cuisine but too much spices for me killing excellent local products and too much in the plate with a consequence an imperfect dressage. But I highly recommend the place anyway ! PS a very popular bar next to the restaurant ~Francois L~Saint Nom la Breteche
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everyone in Portland raves about this restaurant.  One of the meals was outstanding, the second was OK.  The mains were pasta with cauliflower sauce, the second was a daily special which was rock fish.  The pasta was out of this world good.  Lots of interesting ingredients to boot.  The rock fish itself was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  However, the sides except for the mashed potatoes did not work for me.  The red pepper sauce was too astringent and did not match the dish.  The service was good and they make a nice wine recommendation for the meals.~FuzzyBeaver~Montreal, Canada
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great athmosphere - great food - great service, It is really an original old  and very nice  restaurand. We ate at the bar and it was georgeous !~ingridmillinger~Waidring, Austria
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had the opportunity in dinning here last Saturday, 9-10-16 for dinner, it was a very nice place, food good (we both had their steak, it was good, not great), service great.  After dinner we tried to go into the bar for a after dinner cocktail, but no room, even though our server said there were open seats.~Shayla P~Clackamas, Oregon, United States
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Higgins has been a popular restaurant in Portland for 24 years - the chef is the owner. The service is excellent - attentive & informed.  Their emphasis on fresh locally sourced food. Everything was very good - especially the fresh seafood - Chinook salmon in particular. They also have an extensive selection of beers & wines. ~riny~New England
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Higgins is what comes to mind when I imagine the very best food in Portland, served by knowledgeable staff in a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Have dined here numerous times since moving to Portland; we have always been rewarded.  Our favorite space is a table in the bar.~Timothy C~Portland, Oregon, United States
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I dined here with high expectations (based on the reviews) and came away impressed.  Higgins is a friendly, unpretentious restaurant with plenty to brag about (though, they don't.)  I respect their proprietor's dedication to healthy, local farming, and it came through in every bite.  I enjoyed two glasses of the delicious Cameron Giovanni white wine (a pinot blanc) with my outstanding spinach salad and petrale sole special.  "Spinach salad" doesn't do my starter justice - it was a heavenly fall dish, with lovely carrots, deep red beets, and elegant green spinach leaves lightly dressed, with a sprinkling of walnut.  Next, I enjoyed the petrale sole, which was served with an outstanding potato-celeriac blend, and garnished with more fabulous carrots, roasted brussels sprouts and Oregon truffles - and, the baked sole was stuffed with kale and shrimp - I savored every bite.  Absolutely wonderful.  My dessert was a healthy pour of Archery Summit Pinot Noir - another Oregon wine - and it didn't disappoint.  Run, don't walk, to Higgins - you won't regret it!  Also - my server (Mackenzie) was wonderful - she didn't rush me, kept me informed and well-watered, and ensured I had a lovely time.~junior_traveler~Maryland
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love this place!  Everything was just perfect and I cannot think of anything that wasn't.  Our favorite restaurant in town has just closed down and we were shopping around for a new place that could take its place.  Higgins has been around for a while and we will make this our regular watering hole?~whichcitynow~Portland, Oregon
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I were visiting Portland and read about Higgins, so we decided to give it a try.  Made reservations for Friday night.  Upon arrival (20 minutes early), were greeted by friendly front desk staff and said our table would be ready shortly.  We went to the bar for a drink.  Shortly, we were told our table was ready and were seated.  My wife ordered the tuna and I the beef tenderloin and shared the spinach & beet salad.  Everything was prepared perfectly and enjoyed.  Great place and recommend it highly.~BPTTravelers~Clarkston, Michigan
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Saying this is one of Portland's very best is saying a lot, as their are many very good restaurants there.  We had a superb dinner for four....probably the third or fourth time we have been there, and will certainly go back again.  Not cheap, but worth the price.~sacguy~Sacramento, Ca
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This Portland stalwart has a lot going for it - location, cozy ambiance, great service from professionals, good wine list and well-made cocktails.  What came out of the kitchen on my most recent visit was disappointing.  The ingredients were fresh, local and high quality but execution was poor.  Gazpacho with shrimp lacked cohesive flavor.  Mains were worse - tenderloin was well cooked but under seasoned; sides a disappointment.  Does anyone really want 22 pieces of potato? Chard was bland and soggy - and why bother with a demi glace on the meat when you water it down with veggie juice dripping from the chard.  Tuna was ok, nothing a decent home cook could not improve on.  Maybe the chef was off the night we ate there, but unless they get some new talent, better technique and thinking behind the stoves, I would give this place a pass - lots of much better options in Portland~MichaelD1989~Toronto, On
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very nice restaurant, good local fare.  Salmon was excellent.  I prefer bolder flavor so, but everything was excellent. Location is very interesting, near theater and shops.~Chuck S~Idaho
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited based on other reviews. Service was good, wine list was excellent and portions were huge but food was just different and didn't really stand out. Prices looked hefty but are really not based on sizes. I had the penne - maybe beef and fish would have been a better choice? ~Donna H~Phoenix, Arizona
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped at Higgins for lunch while walking around exploring the city.  The service at Higgins was excellent and the food was delicious.  I lost track of my notes on the food, but I remember the chowder my husband ordered.  It was so good I ordered some too.  I had a yummy salad that included an unusual grain. I ate every bit.  ~Barbara M~Clyde Park, Montana, United States
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were fortunate to secure a last minute reservation on a recent visit to Portland at Higgins based on a recommendation from a resident.  Higgins is in the theater district so you need to secure a dinner reservation ahead of time!  Street parking was all full but there is a parking deck across the street.  Not the easiest to navigate unless you have a small car and it too fills up due to the nearby theater.    Our table was in the bar area which worked well as it was more quiet. Pauly was our server....outstanding service!!  The menu rotates often with fresh local and sustainable ingredients from the Pacific Northwest.  We passed on trying an appetizer and devoured the complimentary warm breads/butter which were all very good.  My husband tried the whole pig platter which he said was good.  I had the risotto with pork confit.....AMAZING!  If you visit and see it on the menu, don't pass it up.  We also split the  Butterscotch Pudding...delicious!!  Don't miss trying this popular Portland restaurant, just don't forget to make a reservation.~smariel~Coppell, TX
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With four people in our party, we each ordered something different and were not disappointed.  Service was excellent.  The staff were personable.  It was a lovely lunch.~EKingTucson~Tucson
Higgins Restaurant and Bar~439885~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wonderful place and the food was amazing. Loved the Farm to Table options and it really gave us a great flare of the local cuisine ~gblind~Lexington, Kentucky
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you can't get a reservation at Gibson's steakhouse go to Hugo Frogs. Next door to each other, same owner, use the same kitchen~Kurt M~Bangkok, Thailand
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It is a great restaurant filled with knowledgable people and the bathrooms rock!  One of the best restaurants in Chicago.~vladimirmichigan~Ann Arbor, Michigan
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting this establishment while in Chicago to see "Hamilton".  I had ordered the crab cakes, which were delicious.  My wife, does not like oysters and I was reluctant to order a plate for myself.  The Waiter heard me say this and brought a complimentary half order to our table!  What great service.~Samuel P~Springfield, Ohio
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sunday evening visit @ 5pm.  Both of us had seafood, Tuna & Scallops.  Both dishes were excellent.  Top notch service, waiter (Adam) was knowledgeable & engaging.  HUGE DESERT!  We gave most of it away to the next table! Thoroughly recommended.~HKBus_Driver~Hong Kong, China
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food, service, and absence is divine! A Chicago must.....The seafood could not be any fresher and the joint kitchen with Gibson's Steak House makes this the complete deal!~Dixiegirl5~Katy, Texas
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The heart of the food experience in downtown Chicago..... Fun waiters and great food......We go here every time we visit Chicago and haven't been disappointed yet.....If you happen to order steak here, it will come from a shared kitchen with gibbons...a kleading steak house in Chicago, but I recommend fish here.~jerryr111~Cleveland, Ohio
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The nice thing about Hugo's is you can eat here and get steak from Gibson's. The filet medallions melted in my mouth! We also shared some Norwegian scallops that were delicious! The wait staff was very attentive. We accidentally made a reservation at the wrong location but the host was able to seat us anyway so props to them too!~Christine G~Richmond, Virginia
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The wait staff, bar staff, management and food were all outstanding. We had a fabulous night and the food was unbelievably fresh and so tasty. We ate so much crab and great seafood. Definitely worth a visit. Happy hour everyday with $1 oysters as well.~mlv412~Auckland, New Zealand
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We are here based on a recommendation of a local and it was great. They specialize in all different kinds of fish. It is fancy dining and the wait staff is awesome. The desserts are big enough for two or more to eat so leave room because they are wonderful. ~Al P~Dublin, Georgia
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We celebrated my daughter's 18th birthday last night and it was a great experience.  It was a Friday at 7 and the restaurant was bustling.  The service was really good.  Our meals were great.  Amongst the four of us we shared calamari as an appetizer and then had mains of sea bass, salmon, shrimp DeJonghe, and a 10 oz fillet. The portions were quite large and none of us finished them despite best efforts.  Everyone raved about their meals.  My fillet was cooked right to order and came with a side of Bernaise.  We also ordered the steamed and roasted cauliflower--that was overkill, but good.  The entrees cam with either a salad or soup.    I would certainly come back again. ~RNP1969~Portage, Michigan
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had fresh crab from Alaska and then the frozen variety. All I can say is OMG!  So amazing. We had Chilean sea bass as well. Stunning. The soups were a bit average by comparison but still ok. Wine was stunning and very reasonably priced. Service was excellent from Art. One of our best meals ever!!~Bedeashby~Auckland Region, New Zealand
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We thought the food was excellent and the prices very, very reasonable for the type of restaurant this is. Our waiter was superb, and he even brought a large dessert gratis. Of course, we ordered a very large meal!   You really do need to save room for dessert if you can. All are wonderful.~Dajo43~Fort Worth, Texas
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were asking some local folks where to grab a decent steak at a decent price in Chicago and a guy recommended Hugos... in fairness he highlighted it was more a seafood place but was next to or part of Gibsons Steakhouse and the steaks came from there... a lovely establishment on a busy downtown street with a lot of choices to eat  We made a reservation and it was a good idea as the place was absolutely hopping... tables are packed fairly close to each other but not uncomfortable. By the time we got to our table we must have been greeted by 3-4 people and it's a real nice touch, it gives a great welcoming feel to the place   Our waiter was excellent and he presented the seafood choices on a platter... the dishes all sounded fantastic but I was mentally committed to a steak at this stage but was almost swayed  We ordered a nice bottle of wine (reasonably priced range of wines from about mid $30's to anything you want to pay) and both ordered steaks which come with soup or salad. You can order sides separately and they are large so one will do two people easily  The bisque was excellent and my wife enjoyed the clam chowder, real nice. Then the steaks arrived and they were truly excellent, melt in the mouth as people say. They were cooked absolutely to our order and the side of mashed potato was really tasty  The desserts list looked top notch but we just couldn't manage one each so shared a blackcurrant sorbet and again, portion size was big enough for two.  In the meantime we were again greeted by either the owners or senior folks and we're asked if everything was fine. Not intrusive but friendly and attentive.   All said and done, we paid $180 for the meal which included a $50 bottle of wine - I feel it was worth it given the quality of food and service. If we're back in the windy city, we'll come back here for sure! Highly recommended~Paul121212~Ireland
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were fortunate to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary along with our daughter. The food was amazing as was the service. We waited a little to get a table outside but it was well worth it as the weather was incredible and the people watching the best!~Prego51~Chicago, Illinois
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wonderful meal at Hugo's. The staff and service were incredible. Very attentive, friendly and professional! Our appetizer of Crab Cakes was full of lots of large lump crab just the way we like them. Our main course dinners were perfectly prepared. One of the best Tuna steaks I have ever had as were my wife's scallops. We were too full for desert but saw some wonderful looking deserts passing by us for other tables. Will have to save room next time! Overall great experience.~SomnusBob~Fort Wayne, Indiana
Hugo's Frog Bar & Fish House~429417~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~what can you say all ways love eat here food great, staff great happy to keep going back there. Each time fun love try new new food and wine.~darren b~essex
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Directly across from Manhattan and just one stop away from World Trade Center via PATH.  And, the PATH station is next door to the hotel.  A great alternative to staying in Manhattan.~Georgiadawg70~Eatonton, Georgia
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hotel: Rooms facing Manhattan, 2 minutes from subway. Restaurant: Decent menu with good drink selections. Parking was valet.~DrRoyA~Boston, Massachusetts
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have only been to the restaurant at the Hyatt for Thanksgiving.  I must say it is a treat both for the eye and the appetite.  The meal is served buffet style and has something for everyone.  The food is excellent, the service gracious, and the view of Manhattan is unbeatable.  Make your reservations early as this place has become VERY popular.~Cindy B~Jersey City, New Jersey
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you have business in lower manhattan, and don't mind a short ferry or PATH train ride, consider the hotel. Clean, well maintained and with great views of the Manhattan skyline, the Hyatt is an interesting option. Stayed for a birthday evening out, and easily hit downtown manhattan for dinner. Room was small, but well maintained, and with a great view of the Empire State Building. Pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed the Jersey City waterfront area.~NewYork_NYMoso~New York, NY
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the hotel. Amazing views of Manhattan. Beautiful hotel. Rooms were spacious and clean. Comfortable beds. Had dinner in the hotel and our server was exceptional. Food was good. I would highly recommend this hotel. ~Lynn R~New Castle, Pennsylvania
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Must Valet car. I carry a gun and keep one in car, so this was an issue I wish I knew about. Fancy, nice place. WOWWWWW!!!! One nice thing, you don't get with other places. Boardwalk attached. The most romantic, relaxing, clean thing I did with my wife. Its not long or huge. Small, plenty of seating, amazing to sit with loved one(s) and just look at skyline. A jewel of a moment if your able to capture it.~Rob W~Washington, Michigan
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ok hotel with ok views. Rooms are on sides so no direct views of NYC. Strange design. If I had my choice I would stay at the Westin anytime.~Jaymaxx~Jersey City, NJ
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Perfect location to access Manhattan while still avoid the tourist crowd. Lovely scenery all day of lower Manhattan across the Hudson River.~Bruno K~Tokyo, Japan
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stayed for 2 nights for business.   While in Jersey City, the hotel is right next to the PATH station with trains connecting to Manhattan near the World Trade Center. I was doing business in both Jersey City and New York so this was a convenient option. Note there's not a lot open after dark near the hotel (and a few spots in Jersey City that I wouldn't recommend female travellers walking through alone) so plan accordingly.   Room had a nice view of the northern tip of Manhattan.   Check in process was very quick and staff very pleasant. Room was very clean, spacious and bed comfortable. Internet service also was full strength and fast, no issues.   A couple of benefits over New York accommodations: 1. Very little noise as the hotel is right on the river 2. Rooms are more spacious than most hotels in NYC and if you're lucky, less expensive too!  Great stay, no concerns and recommended hotel! ~YYZtotheworld~Toronto, ON
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The hotel have a nice location , quiet and beautiful, the boardwalk is beautiful but poor restaurant selection close especially on weekends , the view from hotel rooms worth the money ,ask for skyline view rooms pricey but beautiful ~Anafofi~Medellin, Colombia
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The location was great we could see the statue of liberty out our window and watch the cruises. Unfortunately the statue of liberty tickets were sad out to the crown and base that weekend. This was a quick trip since we had drop family off at Newark airport. The area on the weekend was quiet and slow. We walked to local restaurant and around the pier. Wedding going on an east Indian one so it was very busy and loud. The valet was backed up on both days Saturday and Sunday with the large number of wedding guests in lobby and surrounding areas. Lots of drama going on so it wasn't as relaxing as ot could be. Staff not as nm ce as other Hyatts we stay at. Nothing for kids, pool small. Gift shop attend not helpful or attentive when looking for toddler sweatshirt since it was cold and rainy and she forgot her jacket. Ate at local Amiya an Indian restaurant that had a buffett. It was reasonable, friendly, and tasty. Mall ten minutes away where we found a sweatshirt at least. We will consider staying elsewhere our next trip. ~michellemM3971OX~Williamsburg,
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the place to stay! Great hotel right on the water amazing views. Right next to the PATH station which is super convenient. Great river walk on both sides of hotel.  Hyatt always wins with service.~Dave W~Central Point, Oregon
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was the best hotel stay I've had in a while! Came to visit NYC over 4th of July weekend.   Location 5/5 - this hotel is located right on the Hudson Waterfront. If you're visiting NYC you have a few options to get downtown. The hotel is right next to the PATH train which is $2.75 and takes you to the World Trade Center in about 8 minutes. Other option is the ferry which was $4 on the weekend, $6 on a weekday and takes less than 5 minutes. We got some great pictures on the ferry so I would recommend trying that at least once. It was so nice to be able to leave the city after a long day of walking and relax on the much quieter Jersey side of the river.   View 5/5- I don't think there are any rooms with a bad view. We were on the north side of the building in room 819 and could see Midtown NYC and the Empire State Building easily from our window. The hotel was also a prime viewing spot for the Liberty State firework show on the 4th. We could see some of Macy's firework show on the east river, but just the ones that went above the buildings.   Room 5/5- the rooms were spacious and much larger than anything you'd find in NYC. Housekeeping was fantastic and brought us extra regular coffee. Our room had a king bed and a large sofa under the window which was the perfect spot to stretch out and read a book. Also enjoyed the large mini fridge and the two free bottles of water.  Service 5/5 - I forgot a few toiletry items and the front desk had extras for me, no problem. We also arrived early around 2pm but they had our room ready to go. The only room for improvement was the valet which seemed a little chaotic and didn't have a central desk or lead valet keeping things organized.   We will definitely stay here again for any visit to NYC in the future.~planetpeace~Michigan
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the pleasure of staying here as a gateway to family adventures in Manhattan.  Easy access to the PATH which can get you to downtown or lower end of midtown with ease.  Friendly staff at the front desk, complimentary chilled water bottles at the bar, fresh fruit daily.  The Hudson River Suite is just beautiful.  We used our diamond breakfast benefit each morning, and we had the best service.  I wish I remembered our server's name (she commuted in from NYC), because she made every morning so special and fun for our family.  She made up to-go goody bags for the kids each day and was beyond friendly.  Kids even hugged her on the last day.   Even though this property is a little further drive than other NYC hyatts, the service won us over, and we plan to return again next year.~Julie P~Bradford, Massachusetts
Hyatt Regency Jersey City~3203289~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We spent one night at the end of a road trip and we enjoyed our short stay, particularly the stunning view from the restaurant across to Manhattan. We had dinner and breakfast in the (surprisingly unpopulated) restaurant and enjoyed good service, decent food and a great view of the sunset and sunrise. A minor criticism was the slow start to the breakfast service (which we were relying on as we had a very early start for a trip to Ellis Island). Access by the PATH and ferry to Manhattan is easy and cheap. The room was clean and well appointed (we paid $10 for an "up-grade" but we always question whether these tactics are real or just a way of getting guests to pay slightly more for the same room!). All in all, a good place to stay as an alternative to a more central hotel.~Benfar6531~London, United Kingdom
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~AWESOME lunch!  Everything was very fresh. The salmon salad was great!! I am looking forward to going back.~Taurus1072~East Greenbush, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fast courteous service, very accommodating for special diets. Never rushed, and excellent food ..Daughter and myself are vegetarians, and had no problem with the many selections. ~Bill M~Troy, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was very good. Need a few more staff. Kind of hippies type of atmosphere. As I said, the food was good.~JVRyan~Troy, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the food, the atmosphere, the historical building and the prices. This is a great place to have lunch, as the lunch prices are quite good. The ONLY changes I would make are to get rid of all the cheap fake greenery. That devalues the place, and that's a shame, because it's got such a special feel.~Ginnie C~Greenville, South Carolina
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I ordered Mom's Meatloaf and wasn't disappointed by it, in fact I was shocked as one would think that as it was titled that and they just said that it was on house fries that like most places the meatloaf was the star but it wasn't.  I have no clue what they did to them as normally I can't stand fries unless they are beer battered but these weren't and they were awesome.  It was like heaven, sweet yet not to sweet and perfectly cooked and seasoned with spices that were so light you could taste them but not identify what was used.  The meatloaf and chipotle-ketchup and melty cheddar cheese if anything drove them home so it was like heaven with every little bite.  I visited alone and felt weird at first but quickly got over it and made me half wish the wind hadn't been so bad as the outdoor seating was nicely shaded against the sun and it would have made everything ten times more perfect.~Judith F~Troy, New York, United States
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Illium has very good different food. The place is real cool to go to. Always have had good meals here breakfast and lunch.~Sue L~Troy, New York, United States
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely restaurant in downtown Troy that has an excellent menu for breakfast and lunch. I think Troy has better chefs now than Saratoga in terms of chef owned businesses. My honest opinion. Wedge salad is excellent as is the duck confit something or other I had. The Ilium has always been known for its excellent cuisine & never fails to deliver.  A pleasure to try out new items on their menu. They have a back room available for larger crowds with excellent bathrooms. One of my perennial all -time favorite places to eat.  ~Adirondacker1~Saratoga Springs, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for breakfast on road trip to Burlington. Great small cafe with good choices for breakfast and coffee. Service was very friendly and food order was prepared quickly. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the Parisian omelette and both had lots of fillings. Parisian omelette was one of the best omelettes I've had. Highly recommend breakfast here!~mixfl~Florida
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service, food and presentation were second to none. I will return to Illium, my only regret is that it's in Troy.    It was a fantastic find.  The chicken waldoff wrap was delicious. The perfect blending of ingredients.  Another person at my table ordered the soft shell crab with potato chip, it too was beautiful.  I sampled a bit of it, the crab was crispy and sweet, a great balance of taste and texture. I regret we didn't have time to get the steak wrapped in romaine lettuce which the person at the table next to us got. It was simply beautiful.    Service was friendly and respectful of what little time we had to enjoy this adorable cafe.~EZGoingTraveler10001~New York City, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place had a large selection of unique offerings.  It is hard to choose but everything is good so you don't need to worry.  Go with friends willing to share their dish!!   This was such a nice surprise and bigger than it looks from the entrance.~FionaPepper~Troy, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We come to the Capital region 6 times a year, as that our oldest daughter and her boyfriend J live in the nearby area. Each time we visit our daughter suggests a new restaurant that the two of the have found.  We're from Long Island and thusly have had the opportunity to eat in great restaurants on both the Island and NYC. Now we don't claim to be extreme food critics...but we do know what great food taste like. We came here for brunch before going to the Troy Farmers Market and this place can go toe to toe with the best NYC has to offer. My wife had a Breakfast Sandwich which was a scrambled egg with goat cheese in a herb wrap, my daughter had the Eggs Benedict with Tarragon Hollandaise sauce and J and I had the Corned Beef Hash. I tried a bit of all three selections, to say that they were awesome...somehow seems shortchanging the quality of food that was presented.  The service is above par in comparison to the multitudes of resturants that we've eaten at throughout the entire eastern seaboard. I could go on and on...but the best recommendation I can make is go there for yourself and be prepared to be delighted. ~Steve T~Sayville, New York
ILLIUM CAFE~2388510~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~every time we are in Troy we make it a point of going to the Illium. We always order from the daily specials which are AMAZING.  You have to try this restaurant next time you are in the Capital Region it is an absolute delight!~sijudy827~Staten Island, New York
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ate here early before going to Fenway park for a game. Got here earlier than our reservation and no problem, got seated at the bar. Had a great glass of wine then got to our seat. What a fantastic menu and service and food. Oh we had a great time. Will go there again next trip to Boston. ~awhitesides~Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good service, good food. Very nice restaurant. We ate fish and the food was very good. Food came quickly and we had very nice dinner. ~matkarouva~Oulu, Finland
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great seafood choices(tho I'm a Phoenician), we thought that the food was excellent. Good wine list selection-mostly Europe~Robert P~Phoenix, Arizona
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had read about Island Creek Oyster Bar in a SAS airline magazine, and we decided to follow the recommendation and have lunch there.  The ambience is nice (we happened to be there on game day), food is fresh and staff very lovely and helpful with great suggestions! Good wine list too!  Try the fried oyster mini burger, it is very subtle and delicious.~lethertravel~London, United Kingdom
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Look no further if you want the Best seafood in Boston. From the Oysters to the Cod to the Lobster and then the active and well run Bar---Reasonable pricing and the Best quality in the 617~Carl J~Miami Beach, Florida
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not boring usual seafood restaurant. The Bar reaches beyond the typical. Service can be pushy but attentive. ~travelingdalyfamily~Madison, Wisconsin
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Oh my...these oysters are fresh and so sweet and briny!  We arrived without reservations on a Saturday afternoon but were greeted as if they'd been waiting all day just for us!  The service is friendly and efficient.  The setting is sophisticated...more like New York than Boston (sorry Boston!).  Loved the walls lined with wire cages filled with oyster shells...very nice touch.  Seems to be highly popular and I would say you definitely need reservations.  We will do so in future.~good2go195~Newton, Massachusetts
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ordered the Lobster Roll & Grilled Maine Salmon and both are great. Was never a salmon person but this is a must try. The service was impeccable with friendly waiter ensuring everything was fine.~Goh C~Penang
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pros:  the oysters looked fresh in the crowded, hotel restaurant.  The appetizers were fair to good Cons: the hot entrees were not up to par, in fact disappointing.  Fried seafood smelled and tasted of old oil.  Portions were small. Drinks and beers were overpriced.   No wonder the locals were not to be found.~HonoluluExec~Honolulu, Hawaii
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar. Service was very good but a little slow. Had a selection of oysters and shrimp cocktail. Seafood was very fresh, largest shrimp ever! Great spicy cocktail sauce. ~TheFourJones~SC
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The oysters are fabulous, and we benefited from a tip from a regular. Fresh, plump and yum, yum! Our first table was right next to the kitchen, no thanks. Service at our new table, a high top table was somewhat spotty even though we were next to the reservation/service station. No worries, it was busy! Lots of oysters later we had the fish entree and it was just O K. I voted for more oysters for dessert, but was voted down. Tax and tip was about $125 per person, but we had lots of wine. I look forward to returning, but probably just for the oysters.- oh, and the bread is super duper~twostick~Upstate NY
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Traveling to escape hurricane Matthew and staying in the hotel attached, we requested a 6:30 reservation which was of course not possible. The hostess was very nice and suggested we come in for a high top table. We arrived and were immediately seated at a regular table - thank you! The service was fantastic, the food and wine super great. The pasta dish with the short rib and lobster the most decadent thing ever - a caloric splurge, but worth it! Halibut ceviche was amazing. Fresh fish and chips for my date. This restaurant just gets it right. Fantastic food and service minus the annoying snobby attitude.~Hocawine~Nassau, New Providence Island
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We buy oysters from Island Creek Oyster company and it is natural that we would eat at their own restaurant because of our excellent experiences over quite a few years with their oysters, their great service, their terrific staff and their business philosophy.~Ole A~Ithaca, New York
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a 9 p.m. reservation on a Thursday night and arrived to a full house that was teeming with activity. Despite the size of the crowd, our table was ready within 5 minutes of our reservation. This restaurant has an inviting decor and a nice buzz that is loud, but not outrageous. We had a party of 6 and our server was attentive and knowledgable. The menus are changed every day and the seafood is served in all kinds of very artistic and tasty combination. I had a bouillabaisse that was in a clear broth full of carrots, potatoes, and celery. Monk fish, shrimp, clams, and other white fish were fresh and tender. They had a lovely wine list that was reasonably priced. Our party of two had a bill of $166, including  tip. You will NOT be disappointed. Reservations are a must. P.S. I am not a fresh oyster eater any longer, but the selection of fresh oysters was impressive, and  those who had them said that they were fresh and sweet.~indytrims~Indianapolis, Indiana
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a fantastic meal here. The service was attentive and prompt but not rushed. I enjoyed my fish and chips- huge portions, I had to share! Topped it off with a scrumptious blueberry cobbler for dessert. Will definitely return again!~JMMann77~Louisville, Kentucky
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went back after 5 years and even better! Huge and noisy. It is expensive to us (UK visitors) but such good food. Shellfish starter to die for snd Haddock cooked just right. Waiter attentive and friendly Loved it~MickDWinchesterUK~Winchester UK
Island Creek Oyster Bar~1937941~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the red head server we had was horrible.  did not know the menu, when asked questions about what oyster they currently had. " I'm not sure, they change all the time, here you can look at the menu to see" kept making smirks at us and acted as if we where a nuisance to wait on.  told some of the people form the 12 person part we had when they tried to order another drink, "are you sure you want one, your drink is still half way full" ... UMMMM YES!! as the last drink I ordered you let sit in the bar window so that the ice was melted almost half way , and we still had to walk up and get it.  ~thebestjen724~Atlanta, Georgia
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I didn't know if we would make it over to this area during our trip to Boston, but I am so glad we did! We stopped in on a Monday evening and didn't have to wait long for a table. My husband ordered the stuffed shells and I ordered Chicken Piccata with homemade fettuccine. OMG so good! The portions were more than generous and the prices were very reasonable! In fact, this was the best meal we had during our trip and it ended up also being the most inexpensive, even with drinks and an appetizer. We took the T to the Maverick station to get to this area. I highly recommend Italian Express--this place is legit!~hollydiane1207~Valparaiso, Indiana
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had pizza, good but not amazing. If I lived nearby I would eat here all the time. But is it the 2nd best place in Boston?  No. It is worth stopping if nearby but not a special trip. ~bruce h~New Berlin, Wisconsin
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been wanting to visit this place each time we have come to Boston. Finally when I discovered it  was right down the street from the embassy suites Boston Logan airport location where we were staying I was thrilled. It is a small restaurant we were seated right away. My daughter got penne Alfredo with broccoli my son and I got the spaghetti and meatballs  and my husband got the frutti di mare.  My daughter said hers was OK my son and my husband both tried hers and loved it my husband loved his he said the sauce was excellent and the spaghetti and meatballs my son and I both liked the sauce was really good tasted fresh the pasta was good the meatballs in my opinion were just OK but it's a matter of taste.  They are reasonably priced. The next day or the day after we ordered a pepperoni pizza for takeout which was really good and quick and inexpensive .  It is definitely a good place to eat especially if you're staying near the airport . I wonder though why our hotel didn't recommend it maybe they're trying to keep it quiet for locals but that should be hard to do when it's the highest rated restaurant on trip advisor in the area. We got there just in time to after we arrived it started filling up very quickly. Go early.~monica s~Greenfield, Indiana
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I live a few blocks away and really want this place to be really good. But after multiple visits, it still gets the "decent" tag.  Everything is over-sauced and definitely leans to quantity ovet quality. You won't be disappointed but you won't be bowled over.~alfredofreddie~Boston, Massachusetts
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I live in East Boston, and have been to Italian Express more times that I can count. For travelers, the location is convenient and close to the airport. East Boston was once dominated by Italians, so you are definitely enjoying some authentic, family-style cuisine (portions are huge)! The inside is small, so I'd suggest making a reservation (though I never have, as I'm usually ordering takeout or going on a night that isn't busy). The owners are also extremely friendly. FYI, this place is cash only--luckily there is an ATM on site.~Lucas R~Boston, Massachusetts
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I live near Italian Express and order their pizza frequently because it's convenient. Their pizza is pretty standard- I usually go for buffalo chicken or pepperoni. I've gotten their pasta a few times, and each time find that it's too "pasta-y" with not enough sauce. I usually order to-go, so maybe the experience would be different if you eat in-house.~Julia G~Boston, Massachusetts
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family and I were on vacation in Boston during September. I read the reviews on TripAdvisor about Italian Express and we decided to try it.  The pizza was delicious! It was so good and definitely authentic Italian food. Jim, the owner, is extremely nice and friendly.  If you have room for dessert, the red velvet cake is awesome!  If you ever visit Boston, I strongly recommend eating at Italian Express.  You will not be disappointed.~555jmr~Florence, Kentucky
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Small place east Boston! Food all fresh made by the owner Jim! Very friendly come early he gets busy!!! East side eating at its best! A must do! ~Ftlaud9876~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stayed in East Boston doing the Air BnB thing. Turns out it was about half a block away. Went in and got sat quickly. Most of their business seemed to be of the take out variety. Tried the Pasta Fruta di Mare which had linguini, with mussels, clams, calamari, and shrimp in their marinara sauce. Very tasty. Just know that this place is cash only. No credit cards. They do have an ATM in the place. Tried a slice my last day there. It was good, but not blow your mind pizza.~Michael W~Irving, TX
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The two stars go to the food itself, and its portion.   Service, slow and unprofessional:  - Water came way after order was placed; - Bread came way after water, almost right before the main entrees; - CASH only, - although each dish costs between $15 and $25.  #1 in Boston area. Seriously?~Henli0604~Toronto, Canada
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This cozy little place had the best spaghetti carbonara we've had since we we fell in love with the dish in Italy.  Both of us ordered the entree but one portion would have been more than enough - the portions were huge!  Half of each went back with us.  The restaurant was a bit of a walk from the Maverick T stop and was cash only, but we're very glad we stopped.~dannyboyIndianapolis~Indianapolis
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ventured to this side of Boston just for this restaurant; happy we did. We were a bit full after our trip to Harpoon brewery but still found space to eat all of our Italian Express special pizza. Yummy thin crust. The Italian plates passed by our table looked very good too. Lots of people walked in picking up takeouts too.~famtomerc~San Juan, Puerto Rico
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When we visited in mid October this restaurant was rated #1 in Boston. Today it is rated #2.I have been a cheese pizza lover my entire life so you can imagine my surprise when I bit into my slice and it was a mouthful of big disappointment.Hardly any taste,except for the unpleasant sauce taste.My husband had pasta w marinara and a side of meatballs. He said it was good. I had a meatball and it was good.Not as fantastic as a lot of the reviews. Maybe i just hit them on a bad day but I've had much better pizza on the boardwalk and it was a 25 minute Uber ride from downtown.~Tjetty~Los Angeles, California
Italian Express Pizzeria~1954989~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~i consider myself a bit of a pizza snob and this pizza was definitely up to snuff! I would highly recommend anyone going here to enjoy a excellent pie!~James G~Dallas, Texas
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Almost everyone recommended that we try Jake's during our visit. It did not disappoint. We had the fried oysters and crab and shrimp cakes. It was all delicious. Service was good as well.~MissyCW~Kansas City, Missouri
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Clubby traditional decor. Expected a little more from the food. Bland, nothing memorable. Wouldn't recommend.~Elizabeth H~Fort Myers, Florida
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~For a solo gal it was a fab vibe with tasty food and splendid service that included classic American dishes presented like the Hollywood set of an all American dinning experience ~Sandy H~Auckland Region, New Zealand
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hard to beat their signature crawfish ettouffe. It come is a steaming black pot and will fill you up.  Great atmosphere and service, too.~Leroi99~Herndon, VA
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had been to Portland back in 2008.  I thought I was in an area I had not been before until I walked into Jake's.  While the surrounding area of Portland has changed for the better Jake's is still the same.  It still has the old world feel (which is a good thing) and good food.  I think I ate my weight in Dungeness crab meat while in Oregon.~Landlock47~Indiana
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love visiting long-lived traditional restaurants and Jakes is certainly one of these. With it's exuberant neon sign, handsome decor and regional fish-laden menu, it promised to be just right for a civilized lunch in this foodie town. My waiter was cheerful and glib...Everything was fine until the food came. I had the crab bisque and a caesar salad. They were unexceptional...lettuce cut several days ago, soup unbearably salty. BUT I would not be writing this if the server had shown any interest in my satisfaction. Never did he ask if everything was ok...I was prepared to speak up about the salt. Also I was hoping to resurrect the meal with dessert and coffee but I was presented with the check and by then couldn't wait to leave. What a shame.~dancingnancy~Brooklyn, New York
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to Jake's the first time in 1988, again in the 1990's and now in 2016.  This place never changes and that is a very good thing.  The food is fresh, the service is devine, and the atmosphere is old world.    I suggest highly the razor oysters and the stuffed salmon.~Joe P~Kansas City, Missouri
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It had been a few years since I'd been here, but I had a friend in from out of town and knew I had to treat her and her son to a Portland institution, especially since I had some gift cards. I made reservations online earlier in the week which was a good thing as it was packed. I convinced my friend to start with the clam chowder ( she liked it of course.) and we also had shrimp for appetizers. For my main course I had the rockfish which was so nice and paired it with a nice local Pinot Gris. I can't remember what they had but they also were happy. I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was knowledgeable and fun. No room for dessert, but they all looked good.      Oh, the parking gasrage half a blovk away will give y09ou dioscihujnt if you have Jakes's stamp your parking ticket. Gert there earlyu in t heecvning howerver as it dffoes feill up.~travelguy51_9~portland,oregon
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Jakes was recommended by our car service driver and hotel concierge, and they were right about great seafood! We got the cold sampler for an appetizer, it had lox, smoked trout, oysters, prawns, crab and shrimp...it was delightfully played and delicious! I had the scallops and my daughter had the 2 baked Maine lobster tails and both dishes were delicious! Only gave 4 stars because our server was not very friendly at all. If he smiled when taking care of us, that would have helped. Didn't look like he was happy working there! Highly recommend if you want great seafood! ~KimAndRobby~Carlsbad, California
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My three friends and I had dinner here. I suggest making reservations. We didn't have one,but at 5:30 we were able to be seated in a lovely window area near the front door. Scott was our server and he was funny and is very experienced. He's worked there for a long time. We had a Brie and roasted garlic appetizer that was delicious. Two friends got the scallops on a bed of bacon and other savories and it was wonderful. My friend and I split the about $40.00 Boulliabaisse (sp?) which came with delicious garlic bread,and was filled with two partial crab legs,big shrimp and other shellfish in a flavorful broth. I want to go back! The least expensive white wine was Columbia Crest at $25.00 bottle and it was good enough. Another friend got a glass of a can for $11. which she enjoyed. It was a Thursday evening and it was quite busy so that we couldn't always get our servers attention so hence, the four star rating.  We had a most enjoyable time there and I recommend it very much.~Daphne1229~Thousand Oaks, California
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The  beet salad was fabulous and we enjoyed the steelhead, which was cooked to perfection, served with a bay shrimp sauce topping.  The service was excellent, and the atmosphere, comfortable.  It was our first visit to this Jakes, but we look forward to returning.~NANCY W~Ashland, Oregon
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a surprisingly large restaurant in downtown Portland (between the dining rooms and the bar area).  We were able to walk in for dinner on a Thursday evening. The wine list is very lengthy; it should be easy to find something you like.  The dinner menu was also extensive with a wide selection of seafood (fresh catches and famous dishes) and other entrees / salads / appetizers if needed. Food quality was outstanding and service (even in the bar area) was very good.  As you would expect, the meal was expensive. This place has a well deserved reputation and it lived up to it.~Traveldog86~West Virginia
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is the best.  Food menu is different everyday, depending on what is fresh. Cooked to perfection!!  There were 4 of us and we each had something different. Halibut, type of gumbo, porkchop and steak. Not one bad thing to say about any of it. Servers MaryAnn and Shirley are the best. Ask for their station. All seats are good, but the ones by the windows are special. Full service bar.  You cannot go wrong with this place. FIVE STAR all around!!  Can't wait to go back again!!!~branden7~Denver, Colorado
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Warm atmosphere in a traditional steak and seafood way. We have enjoyed everything here...seafood of the day, crab cakes, bisque, steaks (and I'm not much of a steak person) and dessert. Always had great service.~Lisa1154~Portland, Oregon
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have just moved to the area and fancied a little old world charm and thought we would give Jakes a go. The decor and service sets a great expectation which the food was sadly unable to live up to.  We had the stuffed halibut from Alaska and a the seafood bouillabaisse. Sadly the halibut was of the most bland / anemic representations of my favourite fish I have experienced. It was served tepid and was a real disappointment.  The bouillabaisse was good from a seafood content if a little over cooked but the broth tasted as if it were based on a canned soup with some dry herbs added.  It also felt odd to have to ask for an ice bucket for a bottle of champagne.  Maybe we were unlucky with our order but I fear not and it really feels like they are dining out on their heritage vs delivering what made them great.  ~michaelmT9346QQ~Portland, Oregon
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Pearl District and heard Jake's Famous Crawfish has a wonderful seafood. We went during the lunch time and there were lots of business men and women in business suits having lunch. The atmosphere is great! Lots of history in the building. The price was not bad either. Dinner entrees are $15 to $30. We had a lunch special. Scallop penne marinara for $9,95.It was very delicious. And came with salad or soup and wonderful sourdough bread.Also, all the staff were very gracious and professional. Love to go back again.~crestwood2014~Spokane, Washington
Jake's Famous Crawfish~461347~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You just have to eat at this landmark restaurant in downtown Portland.  Love the culture and story around this very popular eating establishment.   We spent a long weekend in Portland and knew about Jakes.  We had a late evening reservation and the place was still hopping. The bar was jammed. My wife loved her sangria, my Manhattan was good but not great.  Dinner was excellent though!  Our waitress was personable and fun and recommended a wonderful white wine to go with or dinners:  stuffed salmon for my wife and I had the Oregon Dungeness Crab - both were delicious  Definitely need to check this place out when in Portland!~talkslikeaduck~Santa Clarita, California
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing clam chowda!!   Fresh lobster!!   The lobster roll is amazing!!   Prepare for long lineups, but know that it is well worth the wait. It's an experience. ~Nadia A~Nobleton, Canada
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As other reviews state, this isn't the fanciest of places but their food speaks for itself. We had the lobster roll, lobster bisque, and clam chowder. The lobster roll is amazing! The clam chowder is very good and the lobster bisque was average. Overall, we were very pleased with our meal~Gerry W~Tampa, Florida
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~From outside it looks like a run down shack but waiting inside is amazing food. Loads of fresh lobster. We had the lobster rolls and a cup of clam chowder for lunch. So traditional. Other seafood available such as stuffed clams. Mussels etc.  Soft drinks only. Very small but turnover rapid so we got a table inside. In summer there is plenty of room outside. Price wise great value for money. Loads of lobster in the roll for $17. Only $6 for the soup.  I think this is a must visit place in Boston. ~TubaJohn~Liverpool, United Kingdom
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had to check it out after the reviews I read. I was in Boston for the day. The lobster roll was cooked perfectly, not too much mayo and I really liked the roll.  I also had the stuffed scallop which was delicious also.  Cute place and very friendly staff.  ~thekeysfans~Margate, Florida
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~James Hook & Co is a very small casual seafood store along the river. They are known for their live lobsters for sale. They are also known for their lobster roll sandwiches. There are a few small tables inside if you want to eat in. The lobster roll was delicious and the workers in the store were very friendly. Next time I am in Boston, I will be heading back to James Hook & Company.~Lovetotravel12341234~Clearwater, Florida
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Super casual (based out of a trailer with limited indoor seating and picnic tables outside). Everything on the menu was tempting. Food was ready fast. Lobster roll was substantial in size, with large chunks of lobster meat. Bun was stale. Husband got the clam chowder, which was also good.~JHMC2015~Knoxville, Tennessee
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food here is good but pricey.  The chowder was thin and missing clam meat.  Had better other places.~Eric E~Fort Worth, Texas
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The seafood you walk away with from James Hook is absolutely awesome. Lobster Roll, crab cake, Crab Roll - fantastic stuff. As mentioned by others this is not a fancy restaurante, it's all about the food. You can sit outside or take away the food and sit outside (Sunshine?..) at one of the benches around the harbour area and just chill.~Yeager74~Hong Kong, China
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is not a fancy place but the food is good.  We had lobster rolls and clam chowder.  Really good with the lobster being sooooo fresh! Seating outside is plentiful.  Inside a little tight.  Really just a fabricated building.  Not fancy but great.~1proudmama~Oklahoma
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is located among several large, towering buildings and seems oddly out of place. However, that is your initial impression that will quickly change after walking in and grabbing some real deal NE food. This place is the definition of a fresh seafood market that just happens to serve food. The Lobster rolls are just awesome, just a straight forward awesome tasting sandwich. We also had the clam and fish "chowdah". The clam was much better than the fish. If you like "fishy" food that you'll love the fish chowder. I also got a double stuffed clam which was spot on. This place is small and has seating both inside and outside (perhaps seating for 20 inside). If you want the traditional NE lunch experience order the lobster roll, clam chowder and double stuff clam, you will not be disappointed! This will be a stop for me everytime I'm in Boston!!~Warren P~Sumter, South Carolina, United States
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This shack on the edge of the harbour must be unique. No wine, no metal cutlery, no frills but excellent food. If you want pampering go somewhere else. If you want lobster in rather different surroundings then this is it!~DJFGW~Halifax, United Kingdom
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was by far the worst food that I have eaten in a long time. Do NOT purchase the mac and cheese lobster. $20 for small pieces of lobster in what looked like a TV dinner. The whole lobster was ok. My husband believes that the frozen lobster tails that we make at home in Atlanta were better.~gtjrpj~Lilburn, Georgia
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We decided to pick James Hook for our first Lobster roll after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. What a great decision we made, not only did we have a fantastic tasty lobster roll but the quaint shack and friendly service made our day. ~Purdy006~London
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stumbled across this place and stopped here for lunch as were attracted by the "fish shack" look of the place.  There are outside tables and chairs and a small seating space inside.  Service was prompt and friendly and the food was lip-smacking good. It is well worth hunting out and is very highly recommended.~planbee~on the move
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Within walking distance from hotel. Small unpretentious eat in or take out seafood restaurant. Lobster rolls are huge with at least 2 cups in the large roll. Best in Boston.  Try the cornerstone clams. Fresh and bring.~Carol96730~Honolulu, Hawaii
James Hook & Company~1438444~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow our first lobster roll of the year, lotsa lobster! 20 bucks so it its be too. But it's worth the price, fresh,they have a large tank full right in the shop. The clam chowders good to, It's Boston so nothing's cheap, but this is authentic and fresh.  ~TODD H~Flagstaff, Arizona
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Awesome service, awesome variety, great food and atmosphere.  Try the Dover Sole (real dover sole from Europe, not the Pacific type) and the large crab claws.  Highly recommend this restaurant!~Neil M~Topeka
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Eat here every time we visit Chicago and it never disappoints, food and service faultless, the only downside being the seriously overpriced winelist~Late-Epicure~Toronto, Canada
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great wine list. Great French dip. This is your typical upscale steak and chop house, along with some seafood, that will not disappoint. The service was professional and efficient, as well as knowledgeable and helpful. ~Bruce M~Seattle, Washington
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had lunch with a friend. Service was excellent. We had the stone crab lunch which include hash browns , cold slaw and desert. All was very good service was excellent. Not inexpensive but very good .~Steve M~Scottsdale, Arizona
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I give Joe's my highest compliment, I went for business with colleagues, but I'm taking my wife ASAP. This is not quiet or romantic, more of a high energy, professional steakhouse vibe! Service was superb, as good as the food ! Don't think this is only a beef place. Dover sole, bone in offerings and deserts were equally remarkable ! Go to Joe's, I will as soon as the opportunity allows. BTW Stone crab and Alaskan King crab appetizer is a must. ~Tim G~Little Rock, Arkansas
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had to go online to write a review about all my positive experiences at Joes Seafood - I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant on more occasions than I can count - why? Because its consistently amazing. Favorites include the Crab Bisque, the Fried Oysters, the fresh Stone Crab during season and the Hash Brown Potatoes. We always get a friendly waiter, and they honor their reservation times, and gratefully they are open 7 days a week till pretty late, anytime cravings hit theyre available and have takeout!~henrydole6~Chicago, Illinois
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to many fine restaurants in my life, and my family owned a famous restaurant for ten years so I know the service business. This was the worst dining experience of any I have ever experienced period.  The kitchen sent out our appetizer with bacon on it though we had a dietary restriction. The bartender Dan apologized profusely and had another made, it came out again with bacon. This time my date ate one violating her religious beliefs.   That was just the beginning. Then a sex crazed server (not our server, some random person) followed my date from the bathroom and would not leave us alone with inappropriate comments,  culminating in flat out verbal sexual assault. I have never been in such a situation. We had to leave without eating.   It was terribly upsetting. The other staff was shocked but they did not dismiss the server. I guess that is acceptable behavior for the waitstaff at this establishment.   I suggest never setting foot in the place.~sidbedi~Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are looking for oysters, crab meat, and steak, this is the place for you!  The crab legs are already cracked, and the steak was prepared perfectly.  The service was wonderful as well -- no complaints.  Book early -- like a month in advance for the weekends.  If you can't get into the restaurant, there are 6-8 bar tables that are first come, first serve.  High-end Chicago dining at its best!~Laney L~Charlotte, North Carolina
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Karen was our server and made excellent suggestions, she was incredibly sweet and very attentive.    We started off with crab legs and oysters for our appetizers and it was amazing.  I had the scallops for dinner and this is usually a favorite to order from any place I eat and these scallops were the best I've had!!! For dessert I had the pumpkin chiffon pie, it was incredible and thats something that you can share with like 2-3 people.  Oh, the dinner sides at Joe's is also something to share between 2-3 people, the serving is quite big.    This place is good for anyone and whatever type of group.  Our waitress Karen seemed quite concern about our sons shell fish allergy that is mild, we had to reassure her he would be fine, haha!  That's an example of their service, extremely accommodating and making sure people are happy!~jazfromohio~Galion, Ohio
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My Daughter and I went on a Sunday night without having booked. We managed to get a table in the Bar to eat. Despite how busy it was the service was good and the food great. Well done~debbyhughes~North Wales, United Kingdom
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of our "must visit for a great meal with good friends" places when we visit Chicago. Steaks, seafood and sides all perfectly done. The aged ribeye and porterhouse are almost fork-tender and big enough to share. Famous for the whole Dover sole de-boned and presented tableside. One of our group had a tuna steak so thick it looked like Devil's Tower. Great sides, impressive and affordable wine list. Service always like you could only hope for most other places. ~Gordon L~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our first visit to Chicago and an excellent meal to start with. We wanted a light-ish meal and chose fish/seafood. Found Joe's whilst walking down the Magnificent Mile, and didn't have to wait long for a table. We started with the crab bisque - really yummy; followed by the seafood platter for him and a half portion of the seared scallops for me. Thank you to Colleen for indulging us and particularly for recommending the scallops and offering a half portion - I wouldn't have done a full portion justice. Though the dining room was busy, the service was excellent. Will definitely visit Joe's again.~Shazq13~Colchester, United Kingdom
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Outstanding seafood fare, best crab cake in Chicago, even the fried chicken is excellent. Sides are great and the Key Lime Pie is vintage ! Eating at a high top in the bar area is fun too !~328mac~New Jersey
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Outstanding!  Dover sole, crab, oysters were all amazing as was the service...thanks Mercedes!  Hands down one of my all time favorite meals!~Kym412~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service is key to this fantastic eating place.   All the waiters and staff are dressed in smart clothing - unusual for America - and the staff were excellent.   There is a front bar area where you can also eat and the main restaurant is at the rear.    It is very large and there are a lot of waiters and waitresses so we were served promptly even though the place was full.  Portions were generous and cooked well.~icequeen5210~Exeter, United Kingdom
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried to book a table a couple of days upfront, but all full in dining room. In the bar-area the same menu is served, but the tables are first-come-first serve. We waited for about 15 minutes before we were able to grab a seating for 2 - we were happy about that! Ordered the grilled seafood plate. Both of us. That was a mistake. Too much food. Had been enough with one only + sides.  and the waiter should have recommended us so.  Brussel sprouts with bacon...jummy!~GroINorway~Norway
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Joe's on our last night of Chicago vacation and let me tell you it was fantastic! Easily the best crab cakes I have ever had. The salad was fresh and crisp, and the seafood platter was to die for. The lobster, the crab,  and the shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection. We also got cake for dessert and wished we had more.~rrenfro1~Tulsa, Oklahoma
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~joe's was recommended to us by friends. The filet mignon was very good. It came just the way I ordered it. The vodka martini was great very strong and it tasted quite good. My wife had the seafood platter and really enjoyed it. The over all experience was quite good I just found it a little stiff for my own taste. Great food however not a fun experience ~Chris H~Toronto, Canada
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab~427758~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~went there couple weeks ago with family. And I am really picky on seafood. But really surprised, that's the most excellent seafood I've ever had in my life.~shirley s~Tulsa, Oklahoma
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been there with wife and 7 yr. old daughter. Friendly reception. Menu choice for the kid was excellent. Prices were a lot more reasonable compared to other steakhouses with a name. I took the Sole which was not good: clearly deep fried for too long, but OK this is something to eat in Europe I suppose. The rest of the food was excellent with a reasonable price tag. Nice restaurant with a swift service!~kriebel009~Brasschaat
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Big restaurant  with focus on seafood and quality steaks. We stayed with seafood and the salad and seafood were top flight. Service was very good even though it was a very busy Friday night~sjl802~Atlanta, Georgia
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner for four at Joe's on a friday night was outstanding. All of the entrees ordered were of a very high caliber plus the service was second to none. I would recommend this restaurant highly to anyone desirous of a fine meal of either steak or seafood. ~Robert I~Bethel Park, Pennsylvania
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, nice interior and nice staff. We had scallops, miso glazed sea bass and a burger. Will come back. Even better than the Chicago restaurant. ~HHajk~Stockholm, Sweden
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Huge bar and dining rooms, great atmosphere and excellent service. Quallity of food was very good and great cocktail choice and wine menu. Seems popular with Washingtonians. Quite expensive, but this just may be down to the painful sterling dollar exchange rate!~Howard D~Cardiff, United Kingdom
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I work next door to Joe's and this is our go to place for lunch and Happy Hour. I love the 3-course lunch! The mojitos and Sangria are the best in town!~F M~Columbia, Maryland
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It started with a perfectly made martini.  We enjoyed shrimp cocktail, oysters Rockefeller, grilled seafood platter, and filet Oscar.  We skipped the sides.  Dessert was great.  We had the key lime pie and Havana Dream.  Service was good.  The waiter gave us his card...  Overall it was a fun experience.  ~SPKinVA~Reston, Virginia
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On par with some of the finest restaurants that we have ever dined in Washington, DC, New York or LA. Service by Bridget was exceptional. Food presentation and quality were outstanding. Couples outing or business dinner this establishment is unmatched. ~Rbs7562~Atlanta, Georgia
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is an institution in DC, so close to the White House, the restaurant has been here for a long time, it's built its reputation (well deserved) on seafood and if you like that, you can go without hesitating, gastronomic service although the waiters seems bit too formal or old fashioned~hydraniem~Paris, France
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate here on October 30, 2016 after finishing the Marine Corp Marathon.  It was my fiance's birthday and they gave us two incredible desserts complimentary.  I love this place.   I highly recommend Joe's!~cappaii~St. Petersburg, Florida
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate here twice during our trip to DC and we were not disappointed. Brilliant service and the food was to die for. Normal massive Us portions, so if like us you are from the UK, be careful when ordering. ~Trelaine10~London, United Kingdom
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We booked a table at Joe's Seafood Restaurant primarily for the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab, and we were not disappointed. The Restaurant looks stunning, a huge bar welcomes you as you enter  the dining area along with great decor. The staff couldn't do enough for us, we had a great table and wonderful service. We ordered our Alaskan Crab (2lb in weight) we did feel a bit greedy, but hey. It was our best night out of our Washington DC trip, a definite must do when in town.~STEPHEN-ABIGAIL~London, United Kingdom
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner there with the friends of ours.  Ordered about either different courses and they ALL were very good.  However, I suggest to go to a different steakhouse for the steak.  Having said that, seafood was phenomenal!  Cocktails were also up to par!~keichv~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak and Stone Crab~6164326~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow- this restaurant sets the bar high for steakhouses.  What a phenomenal restaurant!  Between the exceptional food, impeccable service and elegant ambiance, Joe's is an absolute five-star rating!  Although the food was some of the best I've had in a steakhouse, it was our server, Grace, who made this meal truly memorable.  She was so polite and sincere.  She treated my family so well.  She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  She made some awesome recommendations.  She made us feel like we were her only table, even though the restaurant was packed.    The food and wine- oh my goodness!  Every single bite of food was divine.  The wine was really great too!  Our table started with the Shrimp Cocktail, Chilled Stone Crab Legs and Giant Prawn with Key Lime Aioli.  Everything was delicious.  For the main course, our table split the Grilled Seafood Plate (incredible value) and Bone-In Filet.  I also tried a bite of the Sole in Brown Butter Sauce.  Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection!  The presentation was also beautiful!   We split sides of the Four Cheese Mac n Cheese and a Squash and Sweet Potato Puree with mini marshmallows baked on top!  I'm sure it sounds bizarre, but it was amazing!  For dessert, we tried the seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake and a slice of Key Lime Pie.  Both desserts were fantastic!  I will absolutely return to Joe's the next time I am in D.C.  I will also be sure to request Grace as my server.~Jane B~Buffalo, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ate at Joeys last week for a business dinner. Food was absolutely amazing and the service was even better.~ryan9687~Panama City Beach, Florida
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Downtown Syracuse has many great restaurants but if you want exceptional food and service without battling parking issues, this is the place to go.  Great menu and great homemade pastas, deserts and much more~John K~Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I am staying at the Red Roof and within a EASY walking distance.  Food was outstanding.  Had the Beans & Greens soup and a Caesar salad for 1.  Super friendly and nice service.  If I didn't have my dog, I would eat there.  I will be trying something different every night.  They packaged up my food nicely for pickup including warm bread.  I'm a happy girl!~Jeni M~Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, United States
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have heard for years how wonderful this place is, so when in town this past weekend, a group of 5 of us went.  The host that greeted us was a gentleman and we were seated promptly for our 8:00 p.m. Saturday reservation.  Angela was our server.  Unfortunately, she seemed to have an attitude that would be a better fit if she were a waitress in a New Jersey diner.  However, she did get everything correct and brought to us in a timely manner.  She didn't seem to mind dumping ice water all over the floor because "her pitcher was too full."  The bread and butter was excellent.  For some reason, they brought us three giant ramekins of the garlic herb butter, and it was so good I was sad to leave much of it untouched.  The salads were fine.  I ordered the beef braciole and the serving was huge.  Unfortunately, it was dry and tasteless.  I've made better, and I'm no chef.  My husband ordered veal and shrimp, which was rather skimpy.  He had not been given any pasta to enjoy the sauce with.  Others seemed to tolerate, but certainly not rave about their meal.  We had debated about several Italian restaurants in the area, and wanted to be sure we got a good meal.  We thought for sure we would get that at Joey's Classic Dining, but that surely was not the case.  We won't be back.~nativenyOhio~Ohio
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Made a reservation for dinner on October 29th for a party of 5.  The hostess informed me when I called that it was parents weekend at SU and we might be seated little late.  The restaurant was packed when we arrived, but we were seated right on time.  Our server Marie did an exceptional job waiting on us, she never seemed rushed nor did she rush us. Our group enjoyed everything we ordered.  All of our food was cooked exactly as ordered and it was all delicious.~11_Elisa_11~Syracuse, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife an I were in Syracuse for one night. We didn't want to chance a long wait and wanted Italian. We were surprised to find ourselves driving out of Syracuse for dinner but it was worth every mile (about 3 miles from our hotel). You won't be impressed by the exterior but you'll forget the outside before you get to yoir table. The food was perfect. The service could not have been better. Our experience was better than a number 4 rank. If you want Italian this is the place. ~tiphys~Flint
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is very good for lunch and reasonable.  The steak salad has mixed greens and flank steak really good.  The pasta selections also looked very hearty and authentic and were tasty according to my coworkers.  The quality of food excellent Would recommend for lunch, never patronized for dinner.  It is my understanding that the extra food expense is warranted. ~czaz21~Syracuse, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is always a favorite with us. It has an authentic Italian style flavor, eat downstairs by the expresso machine.~Adrian L~Cicero
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant just happened to be across the street from where we were staying in Syracuse. There is such a thing as serendipity. What a fantastic place. My wife is still raving about her meal: shrimp scampi and I had the lasagna with a big meatball on the side. In-house homemade pasta and sauces. And something called brosha for dessert: amaretto ice cream with raspberries. Delicious. The place has been around since 1982 and Joey even has his own cookbook. You'll spend some money here but it was a memorable meal. I understand there's a less expensive alternative upstairs called Joey's Pronto. Highly recommend.~Anschutzw~Sioux Falls, South Dakota
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We loved our entire experience.  We were greeted so nicely as they prepared our table after a very large party left.  It was a bit late on a weeknight and we never felt rushed. The bartender was also great as she went out of her way to make a special drink ordered by one of our group. The food was fantastic.  We had the traditional items like chicken parm as well as their special salmon.  We were there as we were taking our child to college and we will be back of sure.~bakpbsh~Plantation, Florida
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We made reservations for 530 on a Wednesday night for downstairs at joeys. We ordered some drinks and a calamari for the table. The calamari was probably the best calamari I have ever had. Everyone really like their meals. I had the hot anti pasta seafood dinner and it was great. My wife had the eggplant parm and the portion was  huge and she loved it. It came with either a meatball or sausage on the side. She got the meatball and I did not like it, it was tough. The other couple got the salmon and his wife asked if she could get fried haddock and the waitress said sure. It is not on the menu so that made her happy. They liked their meals and said they would get them again. Our waitress was outstanding. She was a great waitress. It is a small dining area so make reservations and come hunger. They have very good Italian food and excellent service. ~chris13209~Syracuse, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stayed close to here and it was the nearest place to walk to. And are we glad we did. The service, staff and food was amazing. Huge portions at amazing places. Defo recommend!!~zoe1978~London
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped for a long overdue fix of Joeys -it was ver busy but yet we greeted warmly by the hostess and staff ! The chefs creation of gin riggies was off the charts - our server Gina described it and she wasn't wrong - It's ALWAYS a great stop~Mimiev428~Syracuse, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We usually travel with our dog and frequently rely on carry-out meals.  While passing through Syracuse last year, we found Joey's via TripAdvisor.  We returned again this year.  The food is fantastic and the people are great.  I usually get eggplant parmigiana.  It is exquisite.  My Plus 1 gets the veal marsala.  Delicious!  Their bread is also wonderful - it must be made in house.  When I called to place our order, I shared that we drove through Syracuse again this year just to enjoy Joey's.  Later as I picked up the order, the bartender said, "You're the lady who called this in from the road, aren't you?"  I recommend Joey's -- great food and nice people.~Jmcraf~Dayton, Ohio
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked in without reservations and were seated in 3 minutes. The server was friendly and fast.  Our drinks came quickly and she took our orders.  The food was delicious.  I'd go back again and  would definitely recommend it.~Hugh22~Penfield, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in Syracuse for a weekend. We did a quick search for something near our hotel and found Joey's. We walked out after our meal thinking it was the best Italian we have had and the best waitress we have encountered in a looooong time. Outstanding meal. You will not be disappointed~John C~Livonia, New York
Joey's Classic Italian Dining~421551~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in town for just a night on our way to Wells for my sons soccer game. My husband had been to Joey's twice before, this was my first. And was it ever worth the visit. Everything was awesome...from the bread dipped in red roasted pepper oil to the very end~a cannoli. I started with Pasta  Fagioli and it tasted just like my homemade. Our waitress Tammy was pleasantly surprised for me to tell her as much. The salad was good, but you can get that anywhere. My entree was homemade ravioli, homemade because they make their own pasta in house, as most of their food is made to order. My first bite of ravioli had me wanting to eat them all. But I had to save room for desert. Bottom line~when traveling to or by Syracuse, Joey's Classic Italian is a must do! ~Susan C~Tonawanda, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Genuine old-time atmosphere with genuine Italian food (esp sauces). Nothing fancy, just dependable good food.~AdirondackTraveler10~Brantingham Lake
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for comforting Italian food like Grandma used to make, Joey's in Utica is your place. Very very good ravioli, chicken parmigiana,, eggplant parmigiana. Excellent value- we were amazed at how reasonable the bill was for five dinners. Portions were huge. For larger groups, order family style and share dishes. Among the best restaurants in the region, low key, comfortable, "down home" decor.~Perry B~Brookline, Massachusetts, United States
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Joey's is old school Utica Italian food. They have a big menu,and usually a bunch of specials. This is by no means a fancy place,but the food stands up anywhere. Everything is homemade,and the prices won't hurt your wallet. Check this place out next time your in the U!~marcpa74~washington,pa
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just an average place, Nothing fancy, and nothing stands out. Lasangne was a very small portion. Meatballs were nothing special.~evelooney~Upstate NY
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My go to place. Every time someone asks where to eat in Utica this is it. Never been dissappointed. Best meatballs in Utica, stuffed long hots, fried calarmari, layered eggplant, lasagna. Full glass of wine. Try it!~tony9264~New Hartford, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice little spot, unpretentious.  Good service, easy parking.  Ordered special of the day, vegetable lasagna.  What came was ricotta cheese in between lasagna noodles.  I could see some vegetables, but couldn't taste them.  Soaked in a tomato sauce.  Usually it is  a simple layer of thin noodles with tasty veggies that have been toosed in a light sauce.  Veal stew plentiful and good.~mpd~Boston MA
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Old fashioned Italian restaurant in old Italian area of the city. Has only street parking but good Authentic pasta dishes.  Not a lot of tables so difficult to get a table on weekends. ~Ann K~New Hartford, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Open Tues-Sat. 11:30 for lunch. Then open 4:00 pm for dinner. Old time bar & restaurant.  Great sauce & pasta of all kinds. Specials everyday soups etc. Had great Eggplant. Took friend who had never been he loved it. Family favorite for years. Good home made Italian food & salads. Lunch light fair of peppers & egg, sausage, meat ball. Home made soup. check web site for menu.~jomint~Deerfield, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is excellent!   Small, very casual dining area.   Great service!    Would highly recommend for a casual night out.~Adam L~West Simsbury, Connecticut
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There aren't many places where you can get a big bowl of home made pasta for so little money!  Pasta, sauce, meatballs... all really good, as were the greens we had as an appetizer.  All meals come with a basic salad and garlic bread.  Nothing fancy, but nothing to complain about either.   Service was friendly, quick and accurate.~KimMcMann~Stephentown, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an old neighborhood Italian restaurant. The decor has probably been the same since the 60's. It almost has an old world charm. The food was ok but well priced. Cool thing was they had Utica Club on tap!~Johnny-Vineyard~Syracuse, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tucked in a run down neighborhood that I assume used to be Utica's Little Italy, we had some second thoughts parking on the street outside. Once inside though, this was probably the top meal of our entire NY/VT/Canada 10 day trip!  The homemade pasta dishes were delicious and huge. My pork chop pizziola dish was amazing, with two huge chops and loads of pasta and veggies!  Better that many dishes I've had in Baltimore, Chicago, and New York Italian restaurants. See the picture!  If we're in the area will definitely go there again. ~MrSpiceMan~Baltimore, Maryland
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Used to go here often but had not been back for years, what a mistake!  Their food has only gotten better.  The waitress was just great and fun to be with, the food just the best. The long hots were really hot and spicy.  The ravioli made my wife's meal great but also the next day's lunch.  Even the bread was good!  I won't take as long to go back again.~Jeff M~Holland Patent, New York
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in town for a baseball tournament and although we don't normally get Italian food out of town, there were so many in the top spots of Trip Adviser, we thought we'd give one a try.  We were quite disappointed.  The restaurant is not in a great neighborhood.  We were seated quickly and food brought quickly but our server never checked on us and it took a really long time to get our check because she went on break.  We had the clam chowder which was okay but lacked flavor. We also had the chicken riggies and the chicken parm.  The chicken in both dishes was a little rubbery.  The red sauce in the parm was okay but again lacked flavor.  The riggie sauce was saved by the peppers but was pretty greasy.  I asked for gnocchi on the side which was chewy and undercooked.  The portions are large so you fill up but it's not a great meal.~Maureen M~Buffalo, NY
Joey's~1489845~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Welcome back to decades gone by.  In this case it works. The decor probably has not changed since the Sixties and that makes it feel kinda fun.  The food took a while to get to our party of 12 but was well worth the wait.  Most of us could not finish our meals.  We will definitely return next time we're in Utica.~Sarah_W_1357~Boston, Massachusetts
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Didn't have to wait too long for our burgers .....about 10 mins, but even though the burgers were really good, the fries were soft and soggy...very disappointing to get this from Johnnie Rockets.~Janet W~Port of Spain, Trinidad
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Discovered this place one morning looking for breakfast, food was excellent, staff brilliant, we went there every day either to eat to just for a milkshake, we were greeted like family!! everyone was attentive and more than happy to help with my wifes weird meal requests and the way she likes her eggs!, Thank you Johnny Rockets you will be a lasting memory~hallchr~England
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fabulous waiting staff, very attentive and very entertaining :) Only criticism would be that the food was very fatty/oily. The milkshakes were to die for :)~Bu88les2013~Lincoln, United Kingdom
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I know it's just a diner, but the service and food were both excellent, and the shakes were out of this world !! Great value and family fun- watch out for the Johnny Rocket Dance!! ~Teulu_Richards~Blackmill, United Kingdom
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love Johnny Rockets!!!!  The burgers are delicious!  The prices are reasonable. Did not realize that they have hot wings.  Will definitely try them at my next visit.  Will definitely come back!~tarsha1963~Charleston, South Carolina
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really like this location in Jersey City.  I've been to the ones in Atlantic City and in Elizabeth, NJ, and though this is inside a mall, it's really not too busy, but probably because not much foot traffic occurs during weekdays.  I love the new grilled cheese burger sandwiches with cheese inside and out!  The fries and rings are always crisp and fresh, and the soda fountain and shakes always satisfies my thirst.  The entertainment by waitstaff while dancing to the oldies also is a lot of fun, and makes the meal enjoyable!  Just like going to a diner back in the day.  I'll always hit this one up, especially due to it being closest to home.~Mike M~Jersey City, New Jersey
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In the Newport Mall.Nice staff.Like a little 50/60`s feeling.visited only once,so i did not find a thing to dislike. ~Knut A~Skien, Norway
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Johnny Rockets has its own enclosed area in Newport Malls food court. The hamburger and floats are good. The restaurant tries to emulate an era long gone where the servers dance to old songs every now and then. ~marmyrgel~New York City, New York
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Johnny rockets is an awesome place to get good burgers and fries , reasonable price , 70s decor , nice shakes and good ambience , really enjoyed ~mk5705~Mumbai (Bombay), India
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Let me start off saying that the food was really nice. However, I have had varied service experience. One time, the waiter was really nice and attentive while net time they didnt seem to care at all~dsubha~Bangalore
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Looking for a place to eat on my visit to the mall. Ordered the candy crush float and it was beyond amazing and very filling. They had tator tots with cheese and crispy brisket. Haven't had anything like it and since then try to recreate both the best I can until I go back next year. Very friendly service ~Slytherinpurbld85~Hamilton, Canada
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family of 7 and I stopped in at Johnny Rockets for dinner in July 2016. We really wanted to take the kids somewhere "kid" friendly.   The atmosphere is fun and takes you back in time, which is enjoyable for both kids and adults. The staff were friendly and accommodating.   The food is burger and fries style, with the added benefit of unlimited fries. Everything was hot and good.   I wanted to stay somewhat healthy, so I enjoyed a soy bean burger with a side salad. It was surprisingly tasty. I do also like that the menu had all of the calories listed next to each food item.   Overall, we had fun at Johnny Rockets. We would recommend to families with children.~Lanzen~Elkhart, Indiana
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My son prefers to purchase an traditional burger and fries instead of everyday brands while in New Jersey.~psvso~Toronto, Canada
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Super place just like the diners in the old movies.  Great menus and the food is all yummy.  Staff very friendly.  Every so often the lights blink and the staff dance to music.  Very enjoyable. ~Chris G~Groomsport, United Kingdom
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This branch is at the jersey gardens shopping outlet it was a great visit i had the chilli hotdog with fries and my daughter had the phili steak sandwich lovely food and the milk shakes are fabulous very clean and friendly staff you also get a discount if you take your passport with you to jersey gardens as you get a book with the shops listed and what discount you get well worth a visit~Joanie264~Glasgow, United Kingdom
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow, this was probably the highlight of my New York/ New jerseys visit. From the signage to the deco to the employee uniforms, this hamburger diner takes you back to the seventies. The waiter service is outstanding and every customer is welcomed as they enter. The food is excellent and the turkey burger that I had was outstanding. They also make great milkshakes and the leftover is also served in a separate container. Just be careful of the info terminals that they have at each booth as they charge 25c for each game and quiz played~Ugen M G~Sandton, South Africa
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You have to try the Route66 burger at this Johnny Rockets. I do not know what it is, but they taste differently from other similar joints. A nice place to stop over with the family if you are doing some shopping at Newport Center Mall. The retro ambiance and the great disposition of the servers takes you back to the 50's literally.~GabrielDM~New York City, New York
Johnny Rockets~3677821~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~their burgers are always great, though they seem to be getting smaller, bread looks like potato bread, which is good; the special fries are great, though, again, small in size, and maybe a bit overpriced at $4.29; great shakes, the place is pretty empty weeknights, but packed on weekends, since it is inside the Newport Centre Mall.~rex e~Union City, New Jersey
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been here a couple times now. Love the reuben fritters, they r amazing. Good beer and the staff is always very helpful and fast.  Wings aren't very good in my opinion bit I like them breaded. Live band on Friday night was very good. Nice mix of classics and Irish music. ~Justin M~Canada
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good beer and wine options.  Good menu options.  Very good staff. Live music, a separate room where it is easier for a conversation.  ~Jim C~Glen Ellyn, Illinois, United States
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great history and true to the bone  Irish pub.   Enjoyed.  Irish pub menu and so mucg history and beauty in the architecture so well preserved.  So much history to read on the walls .  There is a semi private area to the back suitable for business or private group occasion.   A must stop ~JKRGrenada~Grenada
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been here several times and love the ambiance.  There is a separate bar area much like many an Irish Pub and a large separate dining room.  The food is always terrific and plentiful.  The Shepherds Pie is wonderful and you must try an order of Curry Fries as your appetizer.  Although I have never had it you can also get a traditional Irish Breakfast.~Sheila Q~Syracuse, New York
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten here a few times since being out here and this place isn't bad. Fish and chips and the burgers were both good, beer is always cold.~Bill S~Colonie, New York
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So Irish Pub Food isn't exactly my favorite, but boy, did this make me question it.   Kitty Hoynes is a real down-to-earth Irish pub, and it's what you'd expect- a great bar atmosphere with tons of beer and some hearty Irish comfort food. The thing is, the food is really, really good. (and maybe that's because I'm finally getting Irish Food in New York)  I guess why I hadn't really liked Irish pub food is that too often I felt the food relied on having starches or being fried/fatty and the flavor was never there. But guess what, the flavor is definitely here.  Upon entry, the restaurant boasts how Guy Fieri featured their place on his Food Network show. This got my hopes up and I wasn't disappointed.  My brother and I each got the Shepherd's Pie. It was perfectly proportioned; there wasn't a ridiculous amount of potato and no meat. The flavor was there and it was a great portion. My dad got the salmon, and he was really surprised by how good it was. It seemed as though that salmon could certainly be served at a higher caliber restaurant. The salmon was very flavorful and the vegetables were seasoned well and tasty. My mom got the pork chop and it was moist and flavorful as well.  The service was great; our waitress made us feel at home. I certainly recommend if you're in Syracuse!~Alexandra R~Las Vegas, Nevada
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped here during the Syracuse food tour.  We were very impressed.  Authentic Irish food.  We sampled their version of the "shepherd's pie"--cabbage topped with mashed potatoes, then ham on top.  It was then sprinkled with parsnips and a creamy horseradish sauce...mmmmm.  Definitely a restaurant to go back to when in the downtown Syracuse area.~GLaSota~Cheektowaga, New York
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in here one evening during a weekend visit to Syracuse as it was across the street from our hotel.   Fun spot, lots of beer, adequate appetizers. lots of people.   It was a place to get a drink before our dinner reservations.   All in all, good experience.  One of the group wanted to go back Saturday night for more wings.   It was a definite hit with her.~ksjdc~Kansas
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is my go to place for dinner when I'm in Syracuse.  This time we ate outside, which in itself was very entertaining.  The food was very good as always. The waitress was very patient with us, we hadn't been out for a while and started talking instead of looking at the menu.  I had the baked haddock which is always excellent.  A god 2nd is the fish and chips.  After dinner everyone gets a shot of Baileys.  Nice touch.~funtimefamily12~Long Island
Kitty Hoynes Irish Pub & Restaurant~421671~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We {2} walked in on a very busy Saturday evening around 5;30, after calling earlier in the day to find out that they were no longer taking reservations for the day, but might have some available seating for walk-in's.  We found a small table near the bar and where the 2-man band was setting up to play.  The Syracuse football game was on the TV and most patrons were glued to this game.  The burger that my wife ordered medium came out pretty rare the first time so she sent it back, the replacement wasn't much better, the third time either the chef or manager returned with one that was closer to well done but with apologies and mentioned that it would be taken off the bill.  The waitress couldn't have been more apologetic; she truly felt bad. My Shepard's pie was AWESOME... only wished there was more.  After our meal the waitress brought over 2-shots of baily's as another apology for the meal.  Again I told her that it wasn't her fault and Tracy was VERY pleasant and has to be an asset to the establishment.  We have been there many times, but only to enjoy the bar. We will go there again.  Kitty Hoynes is a very good place and we highly recommend anyone who has never been there before to at least stop in.~Burke55~East Syracuse, New York
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Coming out of the Path station one nearly passes this restaurant, because outside is not very inviting. Inside it's a surprising nice restaurant with in the back of the restaurant a fantastic view on the harbour and on Manhattan (WTC). Except that the service is nice and the food very good. If in Newport a must to visit.~Peter S~Amsterdam, The Netherlands
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent!  During business event organized in Jersey City we been looking for dinner opportunities. We decided to explore Japanese cuisine and we didn't regret. Staff was very polite and helpful,  in fact knowledgeable in french champagne. We took Sashimi Delicious and another variety of sashimi. Fish was very fresh and tasty! They have Tattinger champagne which is good. Recommend to everyone who stay in Jersey City!~mihails265~Riga, Latvia
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was well prepared and presented. Atmosphere is welcoming and the views on the bay at night are beautiful. Service was great. Mica took good care of us. We will definitely go back. ~kennykid523~Amsterdam, New York
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Get a table by the window for a view of the yachts and NYC! Wonderful food, good sake, nice service. ~andreajobs~New York City, New York
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place and much nicer than the original.  Friendly staff and good happy hour.  Lunch is really good also.  I you like Japanese you will really like this place.~John L~Orlando, Florida
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hudson River and sushi doesn't sound like a healthy combo but this place is great. Sushi is always fresh and equivalent to what I've eaten in Tokyo. Whatever your taste In Sashimi or sushi this is the place to go. I've dined here several times and will continue to come here. It's good. Try it.  ~NFC_food_guy~Stafford, Virginia
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had a feast there last weekend with several friends.  The food (all seafood, sashimi and cooked as well as three kinds of noodles) was simply outstanding!  The service was attentive and not hurried.  The atmosphere was relaxing, not loud and obnoxious, even though we sat closer to the entrance and the bar!  Very welcoming indeed!  It was a Saturday evening, and the restaurant was 90%+ full.  The view facing lower Manhattan was a plus!  I highly recommend this place to you all.  Expensive?  No worse than some of the places in Manhattan for sure.  Taking the Path Train there was worth the little excursion to the other side of the Hudson.  I am going back very soon.~beebahk~Brooklyn, New York
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had never tried actual Japanese restaurant before my visit to Komegashi Too. Though I did not have many options at the time of the night, I was very skeptical when I went to the restaurant. I must definitely mention that the staff and service is awesome.   Coming to ambiance, the restaurant looks very small from outside, but is way bigger than it seems. The Hudson river view they have is awesome.  The place utilization is excellent and most of the time the restaurant is completely occupied.   On the food front, I did not want to experiment too much and hence just ordered a California crap roll and a chicken, which they served with veggies and white rice and Miso soup. I dont exactly remember the name of the dish. The quantity is very good for a single person. Mind you they serve Edamame complimentary and hence look before you order.  The price is a little on the higher side, but then this is Newport Jersey City and the experience is well worth it.~ExpertComments~Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was pleased with the overall experience and food. We had a table by the window with view on the little marina and Manhattan. Service was kind and attentive. They run out of bottled still water, which I prefer as  opposed to tap water.. But not a big deal. Service was quick, food served promptly and in good portions. Fish was tasty and fresh. We spent about 30$ each, including wine and tip. The atmosphere is not "super cool". It is an honest place with good food and good prices. I recommend. ~ChiaraCamerada~London, United Kingdom
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are Sushi lover like I am, this place is a must. They have really great sushi, and also great service. I am there mainly the Sushi or Drinks, but everything else is pretty good too. ~Mony G~New York City, New York
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Small, but nicely decorated. Excellent and attentive wait-staff. The food was fantastic!! Excellent rolls. Fresh and tasty fish and shellfish. Seaweed salad was great. Prices very reasonable. Overall, a fantastic dining experience~Leonard S~Stockbridge, Massachusetts
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was good and the service nice. The place is ok even it's a bit dark and not so nicely decorated~pepe_madrid08~Lucerne, Switzerland
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The sushi is fresh & sake is chilled right  Dessert - served Lady M cake & a must after the meal  Waitress is very friendly & excellent service~Marvick5520~Toronto, Canada
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They do have tamari for the gluten free crowd and the sushi is pretty good. Service for take out is kind of rude and it isn't inexpensive. ~nottoosoupy~Worcester, Massachusetts
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an old favorite of ours, located right at the Newport Marina, with a great view of Manhattan across the Hudson. The food is usually very good, as is the service.~sakusa2016~Kolkata (Calcutta), India
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We moved to Jersey City after living 18 years in Manhattan and we love our sushi (having been to Japan several times as well). We were skeptical about the JC sushi but we found that Komegashi Too is great.~Songer5~New York City, New York
Komegashi Too~3521046~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ordered a variety of dishes. The best ones are their salads and sushi/sashimi. Their black cod and tempura dishes are also very good.~NSK888~Boston, Massachusetts
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here on a week night for a work dinner. Service is very average and clearly the waiters are not French trained. They are hap-hazard and can't understand anything. The food is nothing to write home about either and far too expensive for what it delivers. This time, sat inside and could hardly hear anything, as the acoustics are terrible. Like last time, I felt like had been robbed and been made a fool of. If people seriously think this is real French food, they need their heads tested. This won't time will not go back.  NOT RECOMMENDED~copperbottom~Boston, Massachusetts
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First time at La Voile... holy moly is the duck good! The service was excellent too. We had a party next to us with the most annoying woman who was making the staff run around. The staff handled her with patience and kindness... more than I could've done! ~DCPRPRO~Washington, DC
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good French food and wine...right on Newbury street....outside dining available and priceless on a summer night...they even gave us Champagne once they learned it was my birthday dinner...will always go back there whenever in Boston~drdogans~Istanbul, Turkey
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I ate a light lunch here. The frisse salad was great with a nice wine list. Service was quite good and attentive. Very much enjoyed sitting outside and watching the Back Bay scene.~foodsterPortland~Portland
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It has a truly French feeling, with good food and service. Outside seating is great, but the bar area and restaurant areas are equally nice.~Jurgen P~Highland Park, Illinois
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~La Voile is an authentic French bistro in Newbury street. Place is small so make a reservation. The Sole Merniere and the Duck Magret are delicious, as well as the escargot, the onion soup... and save room for desert! Wine is sensibly priced.~FernandoMexico8~Merida, Mexico
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~La Voile tried to create an atmosphere of Cannes in the Newberry street and they almost managed to do so. Sitting outside was very nice. Food very delicious and wine line list quite extensive. Service was much better than in France:)~Gagik~Yerevan, Armenia
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a visit to Boston, we found ourselves on Boylston St. and decided to try La Voile as a result of the good reviews on TA. Not a surprise in terms of menu choices- very French. We shared escargot then enjoyed the mussels choosing different broths. The spicy saffron was very good. Service excellent. Friendly and perfectly attentive. No complaints. ~bermiekedo~bermie
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a typical French brasserie with mostly French wait-staff, but in Boston.  Service from our waiter was attentive. Seating is crowded, but it set up as a typical brasserie with a line of tables along a wall with bench seating and chairs on the aisle side; so that is authentic and expected.  We shared an entree portion of moules in white wine as an appetizer for 3.  It was delicious as were our main courses. Make sure to have a reservation especially on a weekend night. Very enjoyable diining experience.~BocaBlocks~Boca Raton, Florida
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an upscale French Bistro but the totality of the experience was uneven and for over $300 for 3 people, uneven is not a compliment.   The appetizers fantastic, but uneven; one was tiny, the others normal portions. Weird.   The entrees were delicious but presented with the pretense of a 1990's style restaurant with all kinds of drizzle doodles and useless accoutrements on the plate. I had the steak, because frankly, the range of entrees was limited. True, my steak was excellent, but I have had better in lesser restaurants.   Last, the upstairs/downstairs layout. It felt like they had purchased a bar, put a dining room on the second floor which was far too large, and put some French design touches on the interior.   Would I go back a 2nd time? No, Not unless someone else paid. In fact, we had Vietnamese the next night at a real dive and it was just as good.~Outspokentraveler~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant, being close to our hotel, seemed like a convenient choice. It was so much more than that. The food was incredible, the service was wonderful and it was truly one of the highlights of our entire trip!~hazeleyes7896~Livonia, Michigan
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited on a Friday evening - had booked a table outside on the patio but, as the rain clouds were gathering, we were reseated inside. A typically bustling French restaurant where the majority of the efficient staff are French, but of the very friendly variety! Our only complaint is that the tables are squeezed a bit too close together. You have to get on with your neighbours! We both had moules frites - my husband chose the classic moules marinieres while I opted for moules steamed with saffron and a little chili. Both were excellent, and I found room afterwards for a traditional French nursery dessert - iles flottants.~Victoria P~London, United Kingdom
La Voile~1007606~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went with my dad and my brother and had a great time with a great meal and great service. Muscles with curry and lobster rice were amazing.~budlake~Valencia, Spain
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another old school LA choice. Takes me back in time to my grandmother's old cafe. No matter what anyone tells you, THIS is the best pastrami in town.  My only regret is that they are NOT open at night and closed on Sundays, but they do have a really easy drive by service when you can't stop by. Highly recommended!~VickiLosAngeles~Los Angeles
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Are you a Pastrami Holic ? Well. This a must go for it. No doubt about it. Just ask for any Pastrami dish. They are all excellent and highly tasty.~viatoripatuit1~New York City, New York
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a New Yorker, I am very picky about my pastrami. I grew up with Katz's, the Stage, and many other delis. I have to say, Langers has the best pastrami of them all. Located in an area that is undergoing major change, you walk in and you think you have been transported to another time. Our waitress Eveline was the sweetest. The pastrami was so lean. I also had a cup of Matzah ball soup and it was delicious. Have the number 19; you won't be disappointed.~gr8fultraveler~San Diego

Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First off if you're just getting food to go they offer curb side service so you can place you're order and just pull up to the side and they'll bring it out to you. I was getting food to go but also decided since I was there to eat my lunch across the street in MacArthur Park. I found street parking maybe a block away on a busy afternoon. There was a small line outside to wait to get a table. But I just breezed inside and went right up to the counter to order. Friendly staff. Took no time at all to get my sandwich. I went for the classic #19. They give you a nice pickle with your sandwich. The sandwich itself was excellent. Bread was fresh and had a little crunch to the crust. Meat was perfect, juicy. Can't say enough good things about this sandwich. It is a bit expensive. I think my total was close to $20 just for the sandwich. It's something you'll treat yourself to once in awhile. Not something you could do regularly. But I highly recommend it.~Steve H~New Jersey
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Langer's advertises as the world famous hot pastrami. Well I am not sure if it's the world famous but definitely the best pastrami I have ever had. The meat is so tender and not too salty, with the coleslaw and Russian dressing (like a thousand island) on rye bread, it is just simply delicious. My husband tries not to eat carbs so he ordered the Mixed Delicatessen (corned beef, pastrami, and tongue) with no bread. It's amazing. Especially the pastrami and the tongue. Must try! The restaurant is very busy during lunch hours. I would say most of the patrons are men but it doesn't stop me going ;) Street meter parking and Langer's parking on 7th and Westlake. Open Mon-Sat 8am-4pm. Sunday closed.~elsiecpy~Los Angeles, California
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Park off-site, yellow line over, or walk briskly through MacArthur Park, to an endearing local iconic deli. Enjoy the pastrami, sans Swiss cheese, Russian dressing on the side, to savor the purity of this mouth watering rarity, washed down with a Cel-Ray or cream soda; Having searched the OC far and wide, to no avail, will gladly drive 45-miles to satisfy the hankering. Next time, the corned beef has tempted for over 20-years.~BFDiner~Newport Beach, California
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sent here by Dennis from the Holiday Inn Express and it was a big treat.  The service was good with great advice, the servings were large and very delicious and the price was quite reasonable.  ~purplenell53~Lakewood  Pierce County, Washington
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped off here with my partner to grab some breakfast! We both throughly enjoyed our food. Service was great also! Will definitely return before the end of our trip.~Carmchanbrahar~Birmingham, United Kingdom
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There isn't much I can add to all the other reviews singing the praises of this place and the fabulous pastrami sandwich they make. Very simply, if you love pastrami and especially if you live somewhere, as I do, where you can only get so-so pastrami, you have to come here. I was here two years ago and had the famous No. 19 (pastrami, swiss, coleslaw and Russian dressing) and loved it. But this time I wanted to focus on the pastrami, so I had just the pastrami and swiss and liked that one even better. I think it helped make the taste of the wonderful rye bread stand out a bit more, but some might think it is a bit drier without the coleslaw. But because LA Weekly says they like Wexler's pastrami even better, I had to try both on this trip and although they too make a very good pastrami, I think that Langer's is a touch better. My wife had the chopped liver and she liked that very much as well. (Another reason to choose Langer's over Wexlers as the latter has a very limited menu if for some reason you don't love pastrami.)~Mike_C_0180~Arlington, Virginia
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is an old treasure that screams to be supported by locals and visitors. I felt unoriginal ordering the popular #19 but was NOT disappointed AT ALL. Pastrami on rye is the best I've had in years. The booths reminded me of eating out with my parents... loved every minute and every morsel. ~wher2next~CA
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had "#19"- Pastrami, Swiss cheese, and Cole slaw with Russian-style dressing on rye, french fries, and strawberry cheesecake. Check out the menu. Everything looks great.~Simon J~Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to Langer's for a farewell lunch for a co-worker.  Arrived at 11:30am on a Wednesday, was seated quickly. Note that entire party must be present to get seated.  Ordered the #19, their signature sandwich, pastrami, Swiss, and Cole slaw on rye. The meat and bread were warm and tasty.  Sandwich has Russian dressing on it.  Half a pickle on the side.  Co-workers ordered some chili cheese fries which tasted good.  Service was fast and friendly.  They will bag your leftovers for you.  The only drawback is the price.  My meal without ordering anything else was almost $25.  They include a 20% tip for large groups.  Definitely will go back, but can only afford to for special occasions.~GiantsFanLosAngeles~Los Angeles
Langer's~364756~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~best pastrami...period, the famous #17.  Its spectacular. Very nice cozy diner feel. Service always 5/5. Parking is validated across the street with purchase. Also great fries.  Very diverse menu. Wish I could eat every week, but I'd gain 50 pounds a month.~GGZOLA~NORTHRIDGE
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~All that we had was spectacular, wish we came here more often but it is really for a special occasion , the food is great but service is just as good which meant alot this last visit becsuse of the celebration that evening.~italyrstporta~New York City, New York
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Even though Le Bernardin  is located in the Theatre District, this is an exceptional restaurant.  Let me begin by stating that I do not normally like fish.  So for me to rate this restaurant with an exceptional means the chef was amazing.  We had a party of 6 persons and everyone raved about the food when we left.    We had the 3 course lunch and was very satisfied when we finished.  With a wide variety of choices for entrees at the table, everyone stated the lunch was one of the best they had ever eaten.  I highly recommend the Salmon.  It was perfectly prepared and very fresh.  We will definitely visit again.~Milton06~Houston, Texas
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~I had a wonderful meal here two years ago and had periodically but unsuccessfully tried to get reservations from the web before my frequent visits to NYC. This time I called and, as usual, they had nothing until 11pm in the main dining room, but I learned the secret: they have very comfortable tables in the lounge where they can provide a full dinner experience.  We arrived at 515 on a Saturday without reservation but were given a lovely corner booth with plenty of room for the full tasting dinner.  The wait staff and sommelier from the main dining room were great.  The many courses ranged from excellent to really outstanding.  At least two were about as good as anything I've ever had.  After a long discussion with the sommelier, we had a great wine for a reasonable (for the place) price.  Overall, an amazing Michelin *** meal, at a typically high Michelin *** price, but at an excellent table that required no reservation!~wilson17~Montreal, Canada
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Le Bernardin is considered as one of the best fine dining restaurants in the world. I took my wife for our anniversary and we enjoyed every bit of the experience we had with them. The food is just too good. Their staff and service is really great. Very nice restaurant for a romantic dinner or even corporate dinner. You will not be disappointed .~ronnie2614~New York
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Le Bernardin was an experience, not a meal. Very luxurious interior, very organized service team, Eric Ripert came to our table to laugh at me after I spilled my Martini in the first course. Just amazing in every way, good people watching too. Every team member is knowledgeable, friendly and professional. Nothing bad I can say about Le Bernardin. The only thing I can mention to the staff is that even though we had reservations they had us seated in the lounge just long enough to order and receive drinks, but then moved to the table - small stuff. If it's in your budget, - and you can get a reservation - GO!~Rob B~Montreal, Canada
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~My wife and I enjoyed a seamless dinning experience from start to finish. Men's dinner jacket is a must. The waiter requested I keep mine on when I wanted to rest it on the chair.  I remember enjoying the food but not a particular dish. This place was my wife's choice.   I enjoy a warm, welcoming atmosphere when dining out, servers that show their enthusiasm for patronage, IE, Eleven Madison Park. However, their dinner service was professional and efficient, well executed. We never lacked for water, bread, or anything.~Ed T~Toronto
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Party of two enjoyed late lunch (1400hrs start) over 2.5 hours on a Friday in November. Busy when we arrived, but got quieter through the afternoon. Our fist table in the middle of the dining room was a little noisy, but they moved us to the edge which was excellent. Food superb, very good matched wine pairing, and the service was very good while remaining friendly - not too stuffy.~ibj61~Chester, United Kingdom
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Usually michellin starred restaurants disappoint for lunch, but not this place! $87 3 course lunch was mesmerizing! Seafood pasta to start and monkfish better than anything you can get from Spain, for the main course . Desert was equally unforgettable as well. Wines were carefully selected to pair with the cuisine. Service was amazingly professional. Book early tough to get a table~TheWhineguy~Makati, Philippines
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We had the Le Bernardin Tasting menu and were not disappointed. They did a fantastic job of dealing with dietary issues (Gluten and shrimp allergies) without sacrificing the quality of the food. The service was impeccable. The wine pairings were some of the best we have had in some time, with a sommelier always at hand to discuss the pairings. I would definitely suggest this for a special occasion dinner.~JeffMCalgary~Calgary, Canada
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We have been here six times over the years, most recently for lunch. It is always exceptional -- truly the finest dining available anywhere. Splurge for the chef's tasting -- each fish dish is a revelation. And how did I ever survive without that pre-dessert course before dessert? My husband even said it was worth having to wear a tie, which is something!~MaineBiztraveler~Maine
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We ordered the Chef's Menu, and it was PERFECT.  The service had no flaws, the location is very good, and the food...amazing.  The unlikely combination of ingredients (beef ceviche with caviar and brie, for instance) made the experience unique.  One of my favorites in New York. The desserts were like a gift of God.~cpadilha~Rio de Janeiro, RJ
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We were fortunate enough to sample the tasting menu here and it is divine. Perfect balance, amazing combination of flavours and textures, attention to detail in presentation and taste....all meant that we had the most exceptional dinner for a long while. The service is also exceptional - a lot of staff all working in harmony and with one intent. Knowledgable and working according to some invisible network of excellence, we were extremely well looked after but unobtrusively and discreetly so. Altogether this place is as fabulous as you would hope a 3* restaurant in this discerning city would be.~FlightyFeline~London, United Kingdom
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We were quite happy to secure a rather late reservation time as we attended opening night at the opera prior to arrival. The restaurant was very open and spacious, with the tables placed far apart from each other. We were quickly seated at a round table for 2. My husband had forgotten his reading glasses but this was no problem for the maitre'd. He brought us a box with a selection of reading glasses. The wine list was fabulous and I could not decide. Our waiter made a few selections based on my taste and I decided on a Cote du Rhone. The highlight of the tasting menu for me was the geoduck. I've always wanted to try it and it was just as delicious as I had hoped it would be. All of the food was delicious. The service was impeccable. The ambiance was perfect. I would happily return to Le Bernardin. ~Tommie A~Charlotte, North Carolina
Le Bernardin~424434~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~truly enjoyed my meal at le B.  The restaurant, service, wine selection and menu hold up to the reputation.  Truly a special evening.  ~raf823~Los Angeles, California
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Charming, but loud. Big, but with a cozy bistro feel. Decent food and wine list. Enjoyed Steak Frites and well prepared salmon on our last visit.~silver-foxe1~Charlotte, North Carolina
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First it is already hard to believe what an amazing restaurant corridor 14th Street NW has become over the past few years, but it is more impressive that this gem of a restaurant/bistro opened up and just remains the jewel of 14th. You can count on great staff, amazing and consistent food and beverages (especially the bread) and a wonderful experience each time you go. The decor was done with love and you can feel the amazing vibe from the moment you walk in. A must visit for any trip to DC or if you live here. Pull up a bar stool and enjoy!~SetterJetter~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great atmosphere. Very nice food. The Chicken was excellent. Recommend it as a great locale hang out. ~windsurfertexas~San Antonio, Texas
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I stopped in for dinner with my cousin and we had a great meal! After living in France, I can saw that I appreciate the ambiance which is authentic and not kitschy. The roast chicken and creme brulee were spot on! The restaurant got busy as the night went on so be sure to come early or make a reservation.~CMH45~Chicago
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'd heard about this French restaurant and wanted to try it.  We went last night with our son. We all started with excellent French onion soup The meal started with a very good bread basket. My husband had the beef Bourguignon, which he liked. Since it was Tuesday, I had the daily special--lobster risotto. It was wonderful. Our son had the macaroni au gratin appetizer as his main course. With the onion soup, the meals were very large, and we all ended up taking some of our main courses home. For dessert, we split a dish with two scoops of sorbet and one scoop of ice cream--all good. This is a large authentic-looking French restaurant, but it's divided into smaller sections. If you can, eat in a section where the floor is wood instead of tile and the noise level is lower.  My only real complaint is about the saltiness of the risotto and the beef bourguignon.  And don't try to come there without reservation.~Ruth G~Columbia, MD
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It is a bistro, so there is lively conversation. That cannot detract from the presentation and taste of the food. The service was first rate. A true gem in the nations capital. ~Philip W~Linwood, New Jersey
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our choices included the pastry basket, foie gras, cheese plate, quiche, Benedict, eggs Basquaise and a selection of cocktails. Every item was a hit. Service was clean and well timed. This place would work well for all manner of dining; family, business, casual, romantic, etc.~lobsterknits~Boston, Massachusetts
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Schedule one to one and one-half month in advance. You will not be disappointed. Food,service,atmosphere  are all terrific.~SailstarOrion~Boothbay, Maine
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thanks to Trip Advisor reviews, we found Le Diplomate and stopped in at just exactly the right time.  We enjoyed an unseasonably warm November Sunday on the sidewalk, and were transported to France.  Our fabulous waitress Janell recommended the Eggs Norwegian, like she was reading my mind.  I love, love, love salmon with eggs.  It was so delicious and the eggs were poached to perfection. The brunch potatoes were also heavenly, so I forced myself to eat every morsel, even though I ended up way too full.  My husband ordered the Croque Madame, and was just as pleased.  He also ordered a side of sausage, which was really good.  The coffee was strong and hot, and frequently refilled.  Perfect Sunday morning!~DeeBJones~Lexington, Kentucky
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Le Diplomate is a festive place to relax with friends.  They have an excellent menu including some unique and tasty offerings.   The atmosphere is enhanced by an attentive staff and a very robust bar.  The overall atmosphere is fun, if a bit load at times.~Michael L~Davis, California
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This cavernous but cosy French restaurant was packed the Sunday we went for dinner, and understandably so: the main course of trout, sea bass and steak were perfect, as were the desserts. The bustling crowd ranged in age and apparent profession, and all enjoyed themselves, even as an Indian summer's day gave way to a cool showery evening. The waiter even asked if we wanted sparkling, still, or tap water.~Letranger90~Hong Kong, China
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited on a thursday night and the large restaurant was packed.  Although, we had n't booked we were quickly seated by outstanding staff.  We choose to sit outside where a saxophonist was playing on the street.  The waiting staff were exceptional, the food was all first class (around $31 for a steak) and an outstanding selection of wines.  By far the best restaurant I have visited in DC.  Its clearly a very popular French style restaurant and one which I would recommend to anyone.  Booking is probably advisable.  Will definitely be back!!~DiscoDave911~Portsmouth, United Kingdom
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived early on a Sunday morning for brunch .. Greeted by warm hostesses our table took only a minute to pull together , we were seven ..  The place is open with tall ceilings and tile floors and white walls  very much like a French brasserie .. The menu was large with all the early morning fare . We all had eggs beautifully prepared and well plated . The staff was friendly , helpful and very familiar in a warm way .. The service took a while due to the large crowds of people , who like us came out early to eat .. At 9:45 am it was busy .. By 10:30 am the place was full completely inside and out ...  Three things must work for a restaurant to be successful .. First high quality of ingredients .. Second the preparation of those ingredients and third the staff . This place succeeds on all of those criteria and so make a reservation this will most assuredly be a place you will frequent !~Larry R~Columbia
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed a three course meal during brunch and every course was amazing. The mushroom tart for started and the gruyere omelette blew me away! Unbelievable food and stunning venue. Service could not be faulted.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful and we enjoyed our meal in the conservatory with the amazing tiled walls.   Profiteroles for dessert were to die for - I'd eat here every day if I could! ~hmg28~Middlesbrough, United Kingdom
Le Diplomate~4079217~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With all the hype around this place, I was happy that my colleagues secured a dinner reservation while I was in Washington, DC on business. Perhaps I'm a bit jaded by the food offerings in Los Angeles, but I thought my experience was just okay.  This is not an intimate, romantic restaurant. The volume of noise is quite high.  For my main course, I had the trout almondine. While it was good, it wasn't the best I've ever had. Further, our waiter didn't seem to be knowledgeable about the menu, particularly the cheese portion. It would have been nice if he could have offered suggestions on the cheese, wine, mains, etc.~KristiMD~Los Angeles
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another location at the market we never braved the line for.... before this trip.   It's now on the top of my list to stop at everytime we are in town. I loved it. we got a variety of things to split. The eclaires were amazing.... really everything was!~kellirp~Cloverdale BC
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I stopped here 2 days in a row and I'll probably go back again a 3rd time. I can't say enough about the raspberry croissant.  The best croissant of all time. The ham and cheese croissant was good, but the raspberry was perfection. I also tried a friand. Loved it. It reminded me of a madeline in texture, but the flavor was fantastic. Very good brewed coffee, too. This is my favorite place to eat in Seattle. ~730jane~Iowa City, Iowa
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I stopped here twice while in Seattle.  The first visit was on a rainy afternoon, where I enjoyed a delicious coffee and almond/chocolate croissant (it literally melted in my mouth).  I went a couple of days later for breakfast, and the broccoli croissant was just as good.  Reasonable prices, and grab a window seat to enjoy the shoppers at Pike Place Market.~emccwd~Kansas
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was walking in the Market as everyone was setting up and saw this lovely French bakery.  I couldn't have been happier to take a detour from my low-carb diet. A long line at 6:30 am told me that this is a local favorite.  The croissant was flaky and buttery. The espresso was perfection. A must-stop next time in Seattle.~lovestotravel090~St. Cloud, FL
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It has been over a year since we were last here. Went just after 7:00 AM when they opened and was only going to get two. Ended up with four, no will power at all. The ham and cheese croissant, the raspberry filled croissant the amandine and a palmier made for an amazing breakfast for two from our balcony overlooking the sound. Awesome~Johnny-O_1964~Meridian, Idaho
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just go - you will not be disappointed by ANYTHING!  Every item from the pastries to the breads are delicious and worthy.  So good.~sundivers~Washington state
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Macaroons are very good feels like Paul. There is a line and not much seating like everything else should here, we would come back any time.~gaby j~phoenix
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not easy to find a French bakery especially when you are on vacation (not in France). After seeing many reviews online, I've decided to give it a try. Wow..... it's very good. We had 2 baguettes, 2 macaron, and a chocolate croissant. Every single one of them was very delicious. We took them to the airport.  Yes, we're on our last day in Seattle. Wish I had bought some more.~World Passport~Los Angeles, California
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The coffee is nice and service is pleasant but I was sent here for the pastries. Excellent! I'm a sucker for a pastry with apricot marmalade and theirs are excellent!~Brichford~Houston
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The smell of the pastries as you enter the shop was absolutely tantalizing. How could one resists walking away because the line was long and there aren't any available seats? Plus, the friendly and efficient staff at Le Panier moves the line ever so quickly that you could barely feel the wait as you chattered with your families or friends. And oh, the fluffy and light croissants are made to perfection and you can barely feel the calories. I went for the raspberry croissant while my daughter had the apricot. And then we nibbled on a super delicious eclair....oh so heavenly! ~DaffodilBlush~California
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This bakery was a must-do because my friend had such fond memories from her previous Seattle trip. It should be a must-do for all bakery buffs. Hoping not to sound pretentious, I can best compliment this bakery as being extremely reminiscent  of a bakery in the medieval town of Bayeaux, France. According to the wait staff, Le Panier's  pastry chefs were French born and French trained. The delightful ambiance and window counters offer a wonderful place to "people watch" in Pike's Market while enjoying the authentic fare. If you go to Seattle and are drawn to bakeries, go to Le Panier. I doubt you'll be disappointed! ~lrbp~Lake Charles, Louisiana
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a very popular French bakery in the morning and afternoon. They served authentic French bakery items so good we came back twice:) The bakery is located right outside Pikes Market and is a great place to stop before the market opens.~kb5323~Mankato, Minnesota
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good croissants and pain au chocolat, pricey, but authentic. Line up out the door on a Saturday morning, they could expedite that if the person pulling your pastries didn't have to then walk over to the till to pay out. Some seating, but those fill up fast. Recommended.~Ecowoman~Vancouver
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We are lured in the bakery by the enticing smell from the bakery. We ordered several different flavor croissants. They are so flaky and your mouth is  full of happiness since the first bite. We also ordered a small cake and latte, the latte is not sweetened but just perfect when you match it with a sweat cake, a small of the coffee followed by a small bite of the cake, "Oh my gosh!".~Micro-Young~Champaign-Urbana, Illinois
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had breakfast at Le Panier about 9:30 in the morning.  My husband had a chocolate crossiant and I had "choquettes" which were amazingly light and airy.  Wonderful coffee!~Brenda N~Independence, Missouri
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well..this pettisarie near Pikes Market is brilliant. This is our fourth visit and it keeps getting better. The passion fruit macaroons are fantastic. Its always busy, no wonder. Please try the croissants are out of this world Black coffee is wonderful. Wish we were there.~Robin A~Edinburgh, United Kingdom
Le Panier~432598~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~good variety, excellent croissants (particularly the almond) in a nice bright space across from pike place stalls. plenty of seating~thefamilythattravels~San Antonio, Texas
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a long week of family vacation obligations, my husband and I were looking for a great place for a date. We had seen Le Pigeon pop up on review sites, but it wasn't until we took a walk past it and saw how charming it was that we made a reservation.  The place is tiny, but well-planned. There is no stuffiness, no  overly-decorated kitschiness, it's just nice. We were early for our reservation, so sat at the counter, which was lovely.  You can see the chefs working, which for us, people who love cooking, was really fun.  The service is not like your average French restaurant. The servers are friendly, work as an entire team, lean on chairs a little, make jokes; it's super comfortable. They were playing 90's-early 2000's hip hop, which was unexpected and cool.  The fried chicken was amazing. I hate cantaloupe, but when mixed with grilled avocado, tobiko, crab and fried chicken, it was absolutely amazing. We also had some sort of short rib or something that I know was good, but I'm not remembering it as well as the chicken. The real standout for me though, was our starter: the pigeon spaghetti. Omg. I still dream about this dish. I could have eaten two more of these and been happy. It hit every note perfectly. It was rich and decadent with meat and pasta and cheese and a thick sauce, but had an amazing acidity that was surprising. Every part of this dish was outstanding and freakishly balanced.  This meal was definitely in the top 3 of my life so far. I have recommended it to everyone I know who lives in or travels to Portland. Tipping is not a thing at Le Pigeon, which is weird, but sort of nice. For $160, we had a $60 bottle of wine, a starter, two mains and a dessert. So, while definitely more than a regular weekday dinner, it's not out of line for a nice night out.  ~AlliejKenyon~Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Bustling atmosphere with family style tables. Food is absolutely delicious. Great wine list. Knowledgeable wait staff. Make a reservation well in advance. ~brooklyn24~Omaha, NE
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Deserves a Michelin star. At the moment this is the best in town, especially when the chef owner is in the kitchen. Order by the throw of a dart, as you can not miss. I wish I could eat here every night. Portland should enshrine this place as historically important and essential to Portland being Portland. ~CondeCox~Portland, Oregon
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dining for two on a Wednesday. Husband had beef cheeks. We shared a butter lettuce salad at servers suggestion. I had king salmon, which was not special. They do not have cocktails, so I had a tasteless dry rhubarb soda and husband had wine. Dessert was creme Brulee and corn  pudding. Creme brulee was very good.  Note that all tables are communal.~Carsonbetlar~Happy Valley, Oregon
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food and sevice. No privacy, as it is tiny and everyone is sitting on top of everyone. Also, go early and be out of there by 8:30, if you want the entire experience to be as good as the food, because the bar two doors down starts cranking then.  The subwoofers ( new in the past few weeks) jar ones brains, rattle bones, and you can't even talk to the person sitting across the tiny table from you. It ruined what was an otherwise beautiful dinner for me. I will wait to revisit until they move.~rplymire~Homer, Alaska
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fine dining with a twist in a casual atmosphere. My favorite is the Foie Gras Profiteroles with a salted caramel. Best seat is at the bar so you can watch the kitchen performance. LOVE!~TraceyFogarty~San Diego, California
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Going into our reservation, I was excited. Generally, when you're hyped up for something, it's a let down because it just can't match or beat your expectations.  Pigeon however...  Took my expectations, wrapped them in duck liver, deep fried them, stuffed them in a canon, and shot them across the gorge.  The tasting menu was sized perfectly. Sometimes you get too large of portions and can't make it to dessert. Sometimes they're too small and you have to stop and get a burger before you go home.  Pigeon nailed it.  The space is small, and most of the seating options are at a few large community tables.  If you don't like sitting next to strangers, this isn't your spot.   The music is, to my apparently grandpa sensibilities, not to my liking, and more importantly, way too loud.  That's honestly the only negative thing I had to say about the place.    Service - quick, polite, well versed in the menu, ready to answer any questions.  While this isn't fine dining per se, it's right up there.  The atmosphere makes it much more relaxed, but the service is at the highest level.  Silver is replaced without asking, dirty dishes are cleared before new dishes come, waters stay full, as do drinks.  5/5  Drinks - Awesome wine list, a little on the small side, but the restaurant is small, so you can't really fault them for that.  They do not serve liquor here, so no cocktails, which I thought was kind of strange, but that's just extra licensing, space, etc. They do offer a fair amount of amaro's that they make apertifs with, so if you need something like a cocktail, they've got you covered.  You just won't be getting any scotch for dessert.  Food - Thoughtful, creative, perfectly prepared and presented.  Every course sang a song, and there was nothing that seemed over done in terms of either plating, execution, or flavor. Dishes ranged from fresh vegetables and proteins, to salt cured fish and pickled vegetables, all the way to foie foie foie dessert. The menu is constantly changing based on what's available and in season, so expect something new every time you go.   Pigeon is amazing, and you'd be remiss if you didn't treat yourself to a tasting menu at least once.  Do it up, experience the culinary creativity that most restaurants can't maintain, and be satisfied knowing that you're eating at one of the best restaurants this side of the Mississippi.  This is fine cuisine, in a much more laid back environment, but don't be fooled by the loud music, lack of table clothes, and small space. This place is top tier no doubt about it.~FoodMeThinks~Longview, Washington
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I guess I wasn't as impressed with Le Pigeon as everyone else.  In fact I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but the service was so good that I had to round it up to 4 stars.  Especially the hostess that was working on Sunday night, thank you for trying to fit us in best you could!  Husband and I did the 5 course tasting menu, and I found the courses to be too heavy with seasoning and too much going on to appreciate all the flavors that were on the plate.  Their second and third courses were especially too salty for me, I could only eat about half of the dish, which was a bummer.  I was disappointed since it was my idea to come here on the last day of our wonderful Portland trip.  The last course was dessert, which was foie gras profiterole and avocado/lime semifreddo.  Very interesting!  Profiterole had foie gras caramel, foie gras sugar, and foie gras ice cream (!).  I liked the semifreddo better since it was lighter, but again, it's personal preference since the people next to us loved the profiterole and were literally licking their plates.  I thought the price was very good for what you get, it's amazing to dine with such fine ingredients for the price... especially considering tip is already included.  And no sales tax!  I love Portland :)~Sushi888~Los Angeles
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In an old shop, little renovated with funky decor. A noisy, tiny room with communal tables and bar seating at an open kitchen. It all works because the food and service is excellent. Innovative, well combined tastes and textures.  Would seem like a shoestring operation except for the high quality of the ingredients and excellent preparation and plating. Very much enjoyed talking with our young table mates. A benefit of the communal table concept. Knowledgable staff obviously enjoying food and wine and service. Recommended if desirous of unusual taste combinations and preparation methods.~marinaramamma2016~Neenah, Wisconsin
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Superb. My husband thought it might even be the best meal of his life.  We shared everything. We started with the foie gras w/ octopus - it was amazing. We also had the crudo with cucumber mint and over crunchy cous cous- also amazing. For entrees, we had the brisket - incredible - and a special - king salmon crusted with some type of corn & a light and delicious dressing - also incredible. My husband refused to get the foie gras ice cream profiteroles that I badly wanted to try, but the dessert we got was delicious: corn cake with grilled peaches and ice cream.  This is a small, low-key restaurant. No need to dress up. Someone on here wrote that the dress could be thought of as "clean." I'd say that's pretty accurate. My husband wore sneakers which was totally fine.   Highly recommended.~lauramanyap~Brooklyn, NY
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was average at best.  We had the pigeon, gnocchi, vichyssoise and short ribs.  Remarkably they all tasted virtually the same.  Ambiance is terrible.  We were sat at a communal table between 20-somethings having a party and a couple in the middle of an argument.  The restaurant made up for this by keeping the music at a high volume, thereby ensuring we could not converse across the table.  Service was lackluster.  Hopefully, Portland can do much better.~Richard54SanDiego~San Diego
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a wonderful experience in the petit Le Pigeon. The setting was romantic and quiet. We enjoyed the Albacore Crudo, Snake River Farms Wagyu Brisket, and the salmon special. Definitely worth of the title of "Portland's Best Restaurant"!!~Tiffany H~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Le Pigeon~649314~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a fantastic meal, again. It has been awhile since we last visited--and I wonder why! Excellent service, fun atmosphere, nice wine list. Food is king, queen and princess here. Wow.  Started with a butter lettuce salad, delicate, great dressing and shaved radish. So tasty. The beek cheeks were so tender and flavorful. They fell apart. The coq & belly was SO amazing. Two pieces of chicken and a nice slab of pork belly. Cooked perfectly. The green beans were a nice pairing. Dessert was lovely, Foie gras profiteroles--super yummy--  They no longer accept tips here so the bill is the bill  Will be back much sooner this time.~shewholovestoeat~Portland, Oregon
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend and I didn't know where to go for lunch on a visit to Syracuse so as there aren't many Thai restaurants where we are that we enjoy, I chose this restaurant. The restaurant was moderately busy and the service was prompt and the food came out in reasonable time.  I had a Thai hot pot with prawns (i.e. shrimp) which had a balanced flavour of sweet soy style sauce, garlic and ginger. The addition of a lightly smoky Chinese sausage certainly added to the dish. At first it looked like too big a serving but it turned out to be just the right size for me and I even ate all the rice.  My friend had the Massaman Curry which she commented could be spicier but to balance, we both cook curries ourselves and tend to say this about all the curries we get in restaurants.  The desert I had - home made chocolate mousse encased in dark chocolate, with a wafer crescent and home made vanilla ice cream on a baked wafer was superb; my friend's desert - another chocolate creation involving chocolate covered ice cream - looked equally as good.  In all, an excellent meal; the mains weren't over-priced for the quality nor were the desserts. Nonetheless, set aside $40USD for each person if having desert and a wine - I wouldn't have the desert every time but it's definitely worth it if you can fit it in.~lloy0076~Adelaide
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Busy downtown Thai restaurant. Good dining environment but service need to greatly improved. The food is ok and with many selection like Thai, Western & Chinese.~TerrySau~Singapore, Singapore
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner was excellent; both of us enjoyed a special entree: chicken, scallop, and choice of either soft shell crab or lobster. Delicious! ~NjCosmicTraveller~Sarasota, Florida
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was expecting great from the other reviews.  It was fair but certainly not great.  My "hot" dish wasn't hot at all and my wife's dish was also fairly plain.  13 dollar drinks...cmon.  it deserves to be middle of the pack in ratings.  Nothing was bad but not the great meal I was expecting or hoping for.~Cliff N~Fort Ann, New York
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was think it was a high end Thai restaurant before I go. It turned out it is more like European Fine Dining than Thai even though the few Thai dishes available are still very good. This is a fine dinning restaurant with good service and fine food. I was a little skeptic when I saw some review that this is normal or unimpressed. We went for dinner we are very satisfied with the service and the quality of the food. Raw Oyster was good, Mussel was terrific. The entrees we got was fillet mignon,  full rack of lamb, scallops, and of course green curry fillet mignon. They are all very good. We were lucky since we arrived at 6:50pm. After we sat down for about 5 minutes, the house was full and lines outside started to grow. Fine dinning so expect to pay a premium price. We think the price match the quality though.~Qodesh~Shenzhen, China
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lunch included 3 of our favorite dishes: Coco Shrimp, overcooked shrimp, good chili tamarind sauce; Prig Pow, sauce too undercooked to meld flavors of spices and peppers, again, overcooked shrimp; and Chicken in Red Curry, chicken was overcooked and sliced in irregular shapes and thicknesses resulting in sloppy looking presentation. Skipped dessert because Mama's Cardamom Custard was not on the menu. Although the food was disappointing, the restaurant remains elegantly beautiful with good service.~MCBW5875~Scottsdale, Arizona
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped here in need of a good drink, a good meal, and some quiet time.  Lemongrass fit the bill.  The cowboy steak and the filet dinner were both outstanding.  The Pad Thai was different and not my favorite but it was ok.  The space was lovely in Armory Square and the service was prompt.  Not an inexpensive meal for 3 but a nice treat.~HRHmum~New Hartford, New York
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food and service here are excellent. All the dishes we had were really tasty, not too hot and we ate the lot. The only criticism is that there should be more vegetable only dishes.~glasshous3s~Oxford, United Kingdom
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Too many restaurants in smaller markets are unwilling to exceed expectations when simply meeting them will do. Lemongrass is an exception to the tendency to mediocrity in this particular market. Attentive service, pleasing ambiance, exceptional cocktails, and a varied menu make this a truly remarkable dining experience. Well worth the price.~GinaleeS~Mid-Atlantic
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited with colleagues the restaurant was very busy on a weekday night but the staff managed to find us a table within 30 minutes.  The staff were very knowledgeable about the menu and we were able to choose a meal that was very good.~GillPerry~Coventry, United Kingdom
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited with family. A bit too much on the menu. Thai, Asian, steaks. Would be great if they narrowed it down. Some items were great, others were average. Pricey for type of food. Trying to be too many things. Plus, 6 specials? Wait staff nice, but almost too friendly. Kept asking us if items we ordered should stay on menu. Are they making a change? Curries were average.~AMERinLON~New York City, New York
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate here with colleagues on a Sunday evening. The Thai Pot (25-35$ depending on your choice of protein) was very good. The duck with veggies is excellent, and the caramel fig, shrimp, and goat cheese salad was angelic.  One glass of wine costs from 9-12$, and bottles average 40$. We paid 130$ for three persons but took home food as well.  ~Mariana1405~Budapest, Hungary
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We just returned from dinner at Lemongrass Restaurant. The food was delicious & the service given was par excellent! Lindsey, our hostess, was really good & very efficient & helpful. We had a great time. When in Syracuse, dining here is something you must do!~Nel46~Bahrain
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We sat outdoors and enjoyed the music of a talented combo.  The music was loud enough for all to enjoy, but did not interfere with the ability to have a conversation.  Our server was helpful in explaining the menu offerings.  The coconut shrimp appetizer was a wonderful blend of sweet and spicy.  The Pad Thai chicken entree was light and fresh tasting.  The Thai Pot had a delicious mingling of flavors. Service was attentive and efficient.~AnnP55~Huntington
Lemon Grass Restaurant~421569~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were taken here by some locals. The food was excellent, the presentation phenomenal. Menu has something for everyone....~leslieosttin~Culver City, California, United States
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Clean, good seating and reasonable selection of food and drinks. Open 5am -11.30pm and breakfast served until 11am. Handy place to pop in for a snack when at the Terminal.~Ann C~Robina, Australia
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great range of salads containing really interesting ingredients. Tonight the standout dish was the truffled heritage carrots - outstanding. Loved the Mac and cheese. Cucumber and mint lemonade fabulous.  Was a bit confusing on arrival because we had never been here before. Basically you choose as many serves of salad as you wish and/or a sandwich and/or meat/fish and/or one or two hot dishes. We had two salads plus a hot dish each plus my husband had a serving of soup. This was more than enough for dinner. Wish we had one of these at home.~linbinpin~Canberra, Australia
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I call it a fast food because it is a self service restaurant but obviously the quality of what you get served is miles away from fast food. We had the choice of at least 12 different salads and veggies and 6 different meats. The meats are served directly from heavy cooking pots and area absolutely delicious. You can take away or eat in, the restaurant area is very pleasant, bright and airy. Prices are soft for being on Abbot Kinney.~Frenchfrog39~Vevey, Switzerland
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been to three locations of Lemonade and have been happy with all of them. Patrons can view the food when they pass through a line and their food is delivered to their table within a very reasonable time.  Every item is fresh and delicious.~munchingmavin~Los Angeles, California
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really like this place. Very clean and healthy food. Suits every taste and budget. You should try it~amirk973~Los Angeles 
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was my first time visiting a lemonade and I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the selection that they had. It was precise and not overloaded with too many options. I recall having the red quinoa and the avocado and tomato salad. Such an amazing and graceful flavors that were infused especially the red quinoa. Of course because the name I had to try to limit it as well Kama I have the Cucumber mint and it was very flavorful and not too sugary~Mathew G~Toronto, Canada
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just a short walk inland from the boardwalk is Lemonade. Great selection of dishes provided in generous portions by friendly staff as you pass down the line with you tray. Very fresh food and reasonable prices.~G W~Nottingham, United Kingdom
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One in our group was a vegetarian and wanted to try Lemonade. It's cafeteria style - you move down a line and tell the server what you want. There were lots of interesting looking choices. We tried a few of the offerings and weren't really impressed. The food was pretty bland and quite expensive for what you get. ~EatLaksa~Canada
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They had a very nice selection for vegan stuff which was great for me. Food was good for a reasonable price. Carnivore friend enjoyed it as well.~Kartofale~Ra'anana, Israel
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great find, we were recommend by our host. The buffet style food is fresh and tasty with lots of options. Doesn't break the bank either. Recommend ~Jill M~Perth, Australia
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is always a favorite spot, whether you have the pickiest vegetarian or healthy eater, want a good cup of coffee & a yummy dessert or have grumbling tweens or college age boys to fil up you will find something to please everyone. It isn't inexpensive but it's fresh and delicious. I love their selection of interesting salads...kale, shaved Brussels sprouts, tuna tartar, holiday turkey sandwich, pesto mozzarella sandwich and for those who need real sustenance there are hearty stews, homemade soups w/ thick Asian noodles & of course their signature selection of lemonades to choose from. If I am at LAX I head to Terminal 5 to grab something to eat on the plane.~allisong205~New York
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was very cool for anyone who loves fresh food and fresh lemonade. The various flavors of lemonade were refreshing as the ingredients were savory. You can mix flavors of your choice as well. Better than Starbucks drinks and a little cheaper. ~Joseph P~Chicago, Illinois
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant looks like a modern-cafeteria with healthy food inside....how awesome?!!! The lemonade drinks are very refreshing with big variety, the food is so nice, fresh and absolutely healthy, it has salads, rices, chickens, it is vegeterian friendly, vegans also have options and it also has gluten free options, the prices are insanely cheap which means that you can have quality food for affordable prices and not eating burgers for weeks! Highly recommended, but remember to save some space also for the drinks!~tnill276~Los Angeles, California
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very delicious and fresh. Cafeteria  style and loads of options.  Not too heavy. Terrific and funky lemonade options. In Abbot Kinney so neat shopping nearby.~Cymcym~Cincinnati, Ohio
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in for a cool drink and a snack. The regular lemonade was fantastic. The salted caramel macaroons were large and delicious. It was a nice and clean place to rest from the heat.~SanFranciscoMom~san francisco
Lemonade~2435121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We wanted to pick up some food to bring to friends so we stopped by Lemonade.  We bought 2 sandwiches and 3 different salads. Everything was DELISH! Great flavors and reasonable prices.  Highly recommend!~misopiso88~Seattle, Washington
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend of a friend was designated to show me around New York City for a day. After an amazing lunch my coworker said she wanted dessert, and he brought us here. When I saw the line, I instantly thought of the time I waited outside of voodoo donuts in Portland. It turned out to have been a waste of my time. However, I could tell these were all locals lining up, so we decided to wait. It was well worth it! I got one chocolate chip walnut cookie and took the next four days to eat it. My coworker got three different cookies and devoured one within a few city blocks. They are four dollars each and well worth it. I will be back to this bakery my next time in New York! ~Heather G~Salt Lake City, UT
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend of mine told me about Levain, but usually there's long lines.  I made sure I wait on line like Everyone else and taste for myself what's so great about Levain.  Omg I decided to get the chocolate chip cookies it was literally like having a orgasm.  They had just come out of the Oven so It melts in my mouth.  The waiting is worth it.  Must have when visiting NY.  ~kdlc144~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After seeing tons of pictures of the famous levain chocolate chip cookies, I had to stop for one on my recent trip to NYC. They are extremely big and heavy, so I would recommend sharing with one or two others. Also, they are $4, which is pretty pricey for a cookie. The cookie was super gooey on the inside and crisp on the outside. Definitely try it if you like sweets!~Katherine H~Paris, France
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First they feed you, then they kill you!! You become a walking talking cookie corpse who wants nothing but their cookies and talks about nothing but their cookies a few weeks after first whiffing and eating their cookies! Like WHAT ARE THOSE gigantic fat pieces of crunchy, crusty, gooey, fluffy, sweet things you've just held between your fingers? They change the definition of cookie for you so you never see other "cookies" again the same way! Double chocolate, chocochip walnut, peanut butter choco- I am drowning in a pool of my own drool!  Someone please help me with my levain bakery cookie withdrawal!! ...~NavIr16~Mumbai (Bombay), India
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Honestly this place rocks! There can be a bit of a wait, depending on time a day you go. However most i ever waited was no more than 15 min.  4 options on the cookies they have. The chocolate chip with walnuts is to die for.  A must when in NYC. ~gabrielo655~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had heard about Levain Bakery through family members, and oh boy were they right. We had to queue for about 20 to 30 minutes in the cold to get into the bakery, but it was definitely worth it. The place is always crowded and the employees really busy, especially late in the afternoon. The staff is, however, absolutely lovely and incredibly helpful. I've never had such a delicious cookie in my life, and the cappuccinos were amazing as well. In short, I couldn't be happier. Terrific staff, tasty food - don't hesitate!~punxx~Pau
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the dark chocolate chocolate chip cookie. This cookie tasted like nothing I have ever had. It was so rich but so good. It's worth the 4$ ~Sarah T~West Palm Beach, Florida
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I must say the chocolate with chocolate chip cookie is probably my favorite cookie ever!  It taste like a cookie and brownie in one.  I tried the oatmeal cookie and that was good too, but I am addicted to the chocolate with chocolate chip cookie.  Love it!~DDTravelover~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was hesitant to review this place because it used to be my little secret. But, everyone in the world knows about it now so why not. The best cookies you will ever eat. Period. Don't miss the peanut butter chocolate chip and chocolate chip walnut.~Ryan R~Kaysville, Utah
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been there several times and the cookies have been incredible. But I've also looked at the length of the lines and walked away. They need to think of a way to move the crowd through faster, especially in bad weather. ~mondoroc~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a decent treat. Great if you're looking for a filling snack, but definitely not worth waiting in line for. Most would say that it's overpriced at ~$4 per cookie, but considering the hefty size and that dessert prices are sky high in the city, it's actually not a terrible value. Love that they don't skimp on the nuts for the cookies that have it.  I'd recommend coming during off-peak hours if you do want to try it. Just don't expect anything more than a hefty, soft and buttery scone which certainly isn't a bad thing.~iJoeah~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Less of a zoo than the UWS store.  Too much to choose from.  The giant cookies are almost too much.  The fresh loaves of french bread make any dinner a joy.  Go for it.~KenCam55~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ordered two chocolate chip/ walnut, two dark chocolate, and two oatmeal raisin.  Each was well made with lots of butter.  Big chunky cookies that were rich and filling.   We arrived to a line of about 25 people, but we heard a local tell their friend, this line is short for Levain.  Indeed, the line moved quickly.   They take credit cards, and you should plan on just walking over to Central Park to sit and enjoy the cookies.   ~Andrew S~Bay City, United States
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited this bakery after spending hours in amazing museums, and the dark chocolate chocolate chip and chocolate chip walnut cookies were the perfect cherry on top of a long day of being a tourist. There was a line but it moved quickly, as the staff was friendly and very efficient.  There is no space to sit and enjoy your snack but Central Park is a short walk away. Definitely worth a trip!~Katie B~Nashville, Tennessee
Levain Bakery~4522276~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~i wish I could tell you it is not worth it to wait in the long line to get these cookies.   I wish i could tell you it is all a fairy tale.  But alas it is not.  Everything you have heard is all true.   Worth the wait.  I have moved to east side from west side and I will travel across town for these cookies.   That is just crazy.  But I love them so much.~tgreat2121~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic little bakery we were fortunate that there was no queue when we arrived but within 5 minutes it was outside the shop. If there is a queue it's well worth the wait even the coffee's good.~Lee W~Greater Manchester, United Kingdom
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friends (and fellow dessert enthusiasts) who live in NYC recommended I visit Levain Bakery for some cookies during my stay in NYC.  The line was out the door, and I understand why!  The double chocolate cookie was, quite possibly, the most delicious cookie I have ever tasted.  Impressively thick, perfectly baked, and delightfully warm and gooey in the center.  Make the time to stop here and indulge!~Emily N~Atlanta, Georgia
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It is the best cookie I have ever eaten!!! My last day in NYC I waited 1 hour in line to take them home to family. Otherwise it is twice the cost to ship!~pickygirl13~Redding, California
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pick up cookies from Levain Bakery, then head to central park to enjoy.  Yum!  The line moves quickly.~perbecktion~fairfax, virginia
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best experience after visiting the Museum. Served warm, these really are one of the best biscuits/cookies in the world.~Marc L~Gevrey-Chambertin, France
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The only problem going there are the amount of amazing pastries and breads they have! I can never decide- must haves ( chocolate chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip with walnuts and a baguette of course!!~SoliD8783~New York City, New York
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They only sell four kinds of cookies at Levain. Chocolate chip with walnuts is the classic. However, the winner is the chocolate chocolate chip with peanut butter cups. I'm drooling as I type this just thinking about it. Each cookie costs $4 plus tax. So, it's not the cheapest cookie around. But, it's probably the best. There is always a long line that leads out of the building and down the sidewalk but it moves fairly quickly.~Bill M~Hanover, New Hampshire
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This Chocolate Cookie was worth every extra block we wandered in Harlem!! (Which is saying a lot from a pastry chef) i still dream about these cookies...~Luvdssrt~San Francisco, California
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visiting with my cousin and he told me he had a surprise for us. Pulled up to a little shop with a long line. I was surprised to see such a long line for cookies. No longer surprised. He bought one of each, which we cut into fours. WOW, an explosion of goodness. We were sold. Thanks Eddie for such a wonderful surprise. Next time I'm in the City, I know where to get my sugar fix. This is not a restaurant, but a cookie joint.~DanPat1999~Merritt Island, Florida
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We began our New York city vacation walking from our hotel in Times Square to Levain bakery.  We were not disappointed the bakery is amazing.  BEST cookies anywhere.....so happy we went to Levain ~Tom B~Port Mcneill, British Columbia, Canada
Levain Bakery~783460~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You must go to the Levain Bakery!  Cookies are so good.  I had the chocolate chip walnut and my daughter had the dark chocolate peanut butter.  She is not a dark chocolate fan so it wasn't too dark.  Chunks of peanut butter throughout.  Best thing is that they are warm.  I want to go back!!~loriearl~Moses Lake, Washington
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food is okay. Oysters  are iffy. Raw on the half  Schell, Ive gone home and had an unfortunate experience. Great view. Ferry to lower Manhattan. Been here 8 years.  Stick to the cooked stuff.~mcdunne~Jersey City, New Jersey
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had lunch with my husband.  It was a beautiful sunny day.  They had a function there, but we were still seated right at the door which opened onto the patio.  The food was good, filling and drinks were prepared very much to my liking.  I tried a couple of new drinks with bourbon in it.  We had a nice view of the marina and the NY skyline.  They have wedding receptions there, parties and lunch/dinner, whether you're a couple of group.  The prices are moderate.  It isn't ridiculously expensive, but you will spend a little money.  I have only been with my husband, so I don't know if they offer packages for groups or not.~DeeCUnion~Union
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had salad for lunch which was tasty. The view of downtown NYC is the best reason why you want to come here. Parking may be difficult at peak hours and is validated if you eat here. Prices were not unreasonable for the view.~yapmd~NY
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recently went here for a celebratory catered affair with about 140 attendees. Was served a Caesar Salad that was decent then a braised beef main dish over something that was reminiscent of flavored mashed potatoes and green string beans. Although the beef was done well, it really needed much more gravy over it as it was quite dry. Our server was extremely slow and as a result, our table was always served last and well after all the surrounding tables. One of our salt shakers was given to us empty as there were none on the table to begin with. The black pepper was of a rather large ground size and as a result would not fit through the holes in the pepper shaker; as a result, we had to unscrew the pepper shaker, shake some of the pepper in our hands and sprinkle in on our food from our palms. After asking where our desert was after noticing that everyone around us had theirs for about 20 minutes already, we found out that the restaurant had run out of cake and if we hadn't complained, would not have received any. They finally did bring out a substitute 30 minutes after every other table had theirs. Although we did get tea or coffee, we were not asked if we wanted refills though other tables were all asked. The bright spot of the restaurant is the facility itself and the wonderful view of the New York skyline. Everything else left a lot to be desired.~John C~Fort Myers Beach, Florida
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service was excellent, had the meatloaf which was excellent and the views were excellent as well. Have a cocktail and enjoy. ~Toddwillms1~Milltown, New Jersey
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are two reasons for a dinner at the Liberty House: a breathtaking view of Manhattan and an excellent meal I had the crispy calamari - perfect - and the paella - rich and delicious Friendly and timely service Price ok at abt 60-70 $ ~Vecchio59~Savona, Italy
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a hubby/wife dinner on a Sat night. Our reservations were for 8:30 but we were not seated until 9 pm and we got a table indoors with no view of Manhattan. The waiter was very attentive. We had the roasted garlic appitizer and another app which I forgot, and cocktails to start.  Note, there was no bread served to start. They ran out of lamb, so we ordered a club steak and Branzino grilled fish.  The fish was over cooked, and the medium rare steak was rare, but both were tasty.   The indoor seating was full and the space was not too loud.  Our meal was relaxed.  We finished with a brownie dessert and awesome ice cream.  After the bill was paid, we walked around the grounds which were hopping with catered events and loud music.   A bit pricey, but a fun evening for a special occasion.~gymratatoo~Morristown, New Jersey
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We happened upon the Liberty House by chance.  We did not have a reservation but I highly recommend one.  It just so happened we were able to be seated inside; it was a Tuesday night and we were only in New Jersey for a business, waiting on a delayed flight.  I felt our service was fantastic.  Our server was gracious and attentive.  We enjoyed a bottle of wine, appetizers, and dinner.  I had the lamb chops which were excellent and my husband had the scallops.  Everything was done perfectly.  Tasted great.  Yes, this is an expensive place but the view out of the windows and on the patio was magnificent.  I don't believe you only come to a restaurant like this "just for the culinary delights".   I may never make it back to the Liberty House but I can honestly say it is worth finding and having a meal with an amazing view!~sandysisland~Portage, Indiana
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We only stopped in here for a cup of tea and the staff we friendly enough.  Could have a great little daytime cafe menu and attract more people.  ~giovannasolari~London, United Kingdom
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We really enjoyed this restaurant! It looked a little fancy at first glance, and we were casually dressed, so we poked our heads in to ask the staff, and they assured us that it was casual, and it was, there was just a wedding going on and there were a lot of people dressed up. We sat at the bar and ordered a turkey burger to split. It was yummy...and even had an avocado on it! The view was very nice; you can see NYC as well as Liberty Park. The bar tender was very nice, as was the rest of the staff. You can get your parking validated if you're there 2 hours or less.~Sleepyhollow420~Tennessee
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went as a family of 4 for a nice Sunday night dinner and it exceeded our expectations!!   The view was incredible, especially as we were sitting at one of the two outside bars overlooking the NYC skyline.  It was crowded as there were two weddings going on but the bar staff didn't miss a beat.   We had a great view of the skyline as well as the boats on the river during dinner and it made for a special night.  The wait staff was phenomenal and we never had to struggle to gain their attention.  The food was as good as expected and the steaks were the biggest hits but the two of us who had seafood felt the same way. Carlos, the manager,  was doing his job very well and introduced himself and was around the whole night. With the great view and moderate prices, this is a must stop by for anyone looking to have a special meal or even just drinks.~cptnljm~Kearny, New Jersey
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for dinner with my out of town guests.  The food was great but the appetizers were on the skimpy side.  They don't give a lot for appetizers especially for a group of 10 people.  A little pricey too for dinner.  Overall, it was good though but they forgot my dinner and it took an extra 5 minutes.~RVRazon~Fair Lawn, NJ
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for lunch on a cold, rainy day and was delighted.  The view was wonderful and lunch was delicious.  My husband had the Braised Short rib Sandwich which was amazing.  I had the Duck Confit Grilled Cheese was really good.  Service was very good as well.  If you are visiting Liberty State Park, stop in for lunch.~Dawn L~Perry Hall, Maryland
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here to celebrate a friends Birthday, beautiful night,  great views of the Freedom Tower and lower Manhattan.  My Husband ordered the lamb medium rare it came  out gray.  The waiter was not too enthusiastic about taking it back but I chimed in and said it was not the way he wanted it.  It was $38.00 for 2 loin chops you gotta get them the way you want them.  I had the Char it was ok.  But my brussel sprouts were like a rock (uncooked).  Do yourself a favor go for the cocktails and  not the dinner.  The cocktails for 2 will put you back $40.00.  Maybe this place is not as good on the weekend try week night it might be better. They did have a Wedding going on could that have been the reason??~onlyMes~Upper Saddle River, New Jersey
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~after a visit to the ellis island museum,  we stopped and had  a late lunch at this lovely restaurant with a beautiful setting....we ate outside , our server was terrific and the beer on tap was ice cold......  we enjoyed an appetizer salad that was  crisp chilled and seasoned deliciously...... i had the crab cake with a yummy sauce and was fabulous!!! my hubby had the lobster club which was awesome!!!.... we would recommend this  restaurant to any who would be enjoying the statue/ellis island for the day..... its a great after park place to stop relax and enjoy~mk21054~brlin, nj
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~basic menu same as lunch, I wouldn't consider this a brunch. No drink specials . Nice view however we had reservations for 2:30 we weren't seated until 3:15. Better places out there for brunch~Marnice D~Jersey City, New Jersey
Liberty House Restaurant~1312738~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~there are some restaurants you never forget the quality of the meal and this place is one of them. i remember being invited there for a business lunch and thinking it was off the beaten path with a great view of the city. I ordered the hanger steak and was the juiciest and most tender steak i had ever had not to mention the great vegetables and mash potatoes that accompanied it. the restaurant was clean followed up by great service.~offonvacation~new jersey
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a full day walking around Manhattan, we needed food and drinks. This was a wise choice, for a group of picky eaters. Go at 5pm when they reopen and have the seat of your choice. Our waiter, Ben, was most excellent and attentive. I had a cosmopolitan, the cheese plate and the fish and chips. I'm soooo full and satisfied. My friends also agree that the food was very good. ~sewingone~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good kitchen, very friendly service.  We enjoyed our meal, great beer list which we enjoyed as Belgians.  The Chimay on tap is great .~Rvdbergh~Zoersel, Belgium
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great Food and ambiance...respectful service ...I have always enjoyed my time spent at lighthorse...it is named for tha Anerican Revolutionary Officer who raided Paulus Hook, the location of this restaurant~Hfoil~Jersey City
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hard to beat! Brought here by our son in his early 40ths. We have celebrated many family occasions since. My husbands family has been in JC 90+ yesrs, so its nice to have such a place. Foods great, staff is cool, patrons are respectful. Just watch for the spiral staircastein the back. Not  so good for us oldies. But if you can assend, you get away from the noisy bar scene.~mcdunne~Jersey City, New Jersey
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I always enjoy Light Horse. The menu is reverse with something for everyone. Good service, good wine list, nice civilized bar scene. It's a welcoming neighborhood hang.~hi3655~Nyc
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really enjoy the ambiance. It's clean and sleek. The brunch menu is fairly decent. This is a nice place to dine for brunch or early dinner.   The service is suffice. They are always able to seat you right away.   I have it a 3 because the parking is horrendous! There is never any where to park. If you're extremely hungry this would not be the ideal place just because this area is overly crowded with residents who park their cars.  Enjoy! The French toast is Delish!~Maroonsabr~Jersey City, New Jersey
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's always a great environment/setting. Not cheap, but we have taken out of town guests there several times and everyone has been impressed. They always try to accommodate us but reservations are suggested. Sometimes service is slow, but the food always makes up for it. Just a great neighborhood gem.~in2itMinnesota~Jersey City, New Jersey
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located in an historic building and named for an historic American revolutionary hero, this place has a classic "Ye Old Tavern" feel.   The menu is classic New York / New England, with days of the week specials and a good selection of classic seafood dishes and steaks.  The drinks are well-prepared and the wine list has a number of good value wines that won't break the bank.  The raw bar is featured on the menu and is an excellent choice.  We had the full raw bar, that comes to the table on a very large pizza-like pan filled with ice and a delicious selection of clams, oysters, shrimp and mussels.  The Wellpoint oysters were fabulous and they had 3 kinds of raw clams, which is unusual.  All delicious.  I also recommend the house-made mozzarella and tomato salad.  It was truly the best mozzarella I have ever had, with a lovely creamy texture and nutty taste.  The only disappointment was the daily special "Clam Bake", which was a collection of overcooked seafood in an overly salty Bay Seasoning broth.  Two people at our table had the dish and the collection of seafood in each was quite different.  One was loaded with fish and the other had one small piece of fish.    Except for the disappointing daily special, this would be a four-star rated place.  The service was adequate but nothing outstanding.   I recommend sitting in the gallery, which is a little quieter than the main dining room.~Arlingtoniantravelle~Arlington, Virginia
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Made our reservation for 4 people on 12 July 2015 for 1 October 2016, way in advance. The 4 of us were leaving on a cruise the next day and were staying at the Hyatt a few blocks from the Light Horse. Our driving was running late and we called to inform the Tavern we MIGHT be 5 minutes late. When we arrived on time our table on the window had just been given to an obvious local and we had to wait about 10 minutes while they found a table and stuck it near the kitchen between the in and out doors, very busy and not a great place to sit. I had read reviews that the locals get the better tables, in fact a table near us for 6 sat empty the whole time we were there. Service was fair and the Saturday night clam bake was nothing to write home about. It looked good on the cover but it did not read well. We will not return.~shark769~Valrico, Florida
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Met up with daughter and husband for late dinner. First time here for all, and all want to return. Waitress Kelly started right from the drinks, recommending the "Paulus Hook" cocktail as better than my manhattan. She was so right!  Delicious. Two of us had the clam bake, a special on Sat night. It had shrimp, mussels, clams, fish, calamari, and corn in an Old Bay broth. Wanted to drink the broth...my daughter had the roasted duck breast and it was delicious with an outstanding sauce. My wife had the baked meatloaf stated the mashed potatoes and spinach were really good, the meatloaf was "good"(only reason not 5 stars review). Dinner was 7:30pm, no crowd and we sat upstairs which is slightly quieter from the bar area. The waitress and bus person were simply very good at their tasks. We had great service here. However, for good food and service, remember to bring the wallet.~alcarp~Buffalo, NY
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice, kind of quiet place, maybe because it was a rainy evening. Raw oysters and clams, good. Mussels, excellent. The duck breast was medium instead of medium-rare, but quite good. Almost any kind of beer, we had an excellent belgian La Chouffe. Great service.~Mona B~Logan, Utah
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere is great. It has a romantic cozy feel. The food and drinks are very good. It is a good date place!~PAffenita~New York City, New York
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The outside patio is very nice and the service is quick and friendly.  The Sangria has an unique but good flavor and the food is fresh.  We were there during their brunch and wanted to order off the menu and some items were not available but that was communicated in a professional and courteous manner.  We settled on the Cod Burger and the Crab Cakes with chips.  The chips were fresh and warm and both the burger and the crab cakes were excellent.~Mitch M~Colleyville, Texas
Lighthorse Tavern~797691~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were on a weeks holiday to NY from Scotland staying at the Jersey City end of the Hudson. What a smart decision as we found plenty of quality paces to eat and drink within walking distance from our hotel. One of the best for both food, drink and service in a quality estanishment was at the Lighthorse. A special word of thanks to our barman Don who was an absolute star, friendly,efficient and funny and a credit to the Tavern. We returned the following morning for a breakfast which was fresh,tasty and again served with a smile. Thanks also to owner Joe, when we return to NY the Lighthorse will be our first stop.~GRFoster~Hamilton
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was amazing, the service couldn't have been better.  Family friendly, top notch food..great all around~andrewpitagorsky~New York City, New York
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I do love a good steakhouse and after much research I booked a table for 2 for Friday night just gone at Lincoln Square Steak.  My other half is a vegetarian and the menu offered 2 or 3 dishes for her as well as a multitude of sides, which is predominantly why I chose this restaurant.  We were seated promptly in what looked like a full dining room and were given an extensive wine list to peruse, which had something for everyone's budget.  We chose a bottle of Argentinian Malbec that we both enjoyed very much.  We were presented with warm bread which was followed by a complimentary mushroom ravioli, both of which were excellent.  I ordered the New York strip, cooked Black & Blue, along with creamed spinach (they'd run out of asparagus).  My partner ordered a baked potatoe (which was huge) along with a truffle mac & cheese side and a chopped salad.  My steak was cooked perfectly and ranks amongst one of the best I've tasted.  The sides were equally as good and both of us enjoyed the meal.  We were then treated to a complimentary trio of desserts, courtesy of the chef which sealed off the meal lovely.  An excellent evening and I heartily recommend you try the place when in NYC.~Hoppy75~Warwick, United Kingdom
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our group of 6 had a celebratory post-marathon dinner at Lincoln Square on Nov 6th. We were all so impressed! Everyone's steak was cooked perfectly, and our sides were delicious. I had the petite filet mignon and with my 2 sides it was the perfect amount of food. (Speaking of sides, if you are a Mac and cheese fan don't miss the lobster Mac!) A gentleman we realized later to be the owner came by and congratulated those in our group who had run and were wearing their medals, which we thought was very nice of him. The food was outstanding and we felt very well taken care of by the friendly and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend! ~Crystal_Lank~Thunder Bay, Canada
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Place was everything as advertised.   Where to begin...  The feel. Being off the main ave, makes it feel so New York.  When you enter...it gives an old feel New York steak vibe, taking me back to a kid, and watching old movies and eating steak and potatoes that fill you up. The small window facing the street gives a look in at what's happening feel, while still seeing how the vibe is outside.  The bar. Great spot, in the corner...with a piano...perfect. Art work is just killer.  Drinks are not held back. Top shelf all around. Great service and friendly. Never felt like I was in a dessert dying of thirst. Piano is a HUGE HUGE plus.  The food. Got a table with me and my friend. Steak was perfect. Pasta was sublime. Potatoes seemed to be bottomless and killed tuna .....place was really great.  This place should not be missed if on the area at Lincoln center....or taking someone out for a special occasion. Go, enjoy, don't hold back.~Michael A~New Providence, New Jersey
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sunday evening diner, great porterhouse for 3, excellent wine and friendly service, with complementary starter and desserts from the house. ~Nic0lasBer~Paris
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived as the doors were opening on Sat. evening and there were around 10 people in line waiting . My wife  and I had a small lunch very early so we were hungry and looking forward to a fine steak dinner. I ordered a Manhattan and it was huge,($17.00) and hit the spot with the bacon appetizer. If you order the bacon it is $6.00 per strip and each strip is approx.. 2 inches wide by about 8 inches long and over on quarter inch thick, so be careful ordering or you might fill up on bacon     We followed with the prime dry aged porterhouse for two, with charred brusells sprouts and pancetta, and yukon gold puree.........Jackpot!!  Everything was excellent, and Bruno stopped by to make sure it was. Service , also excellent. Reservations a must unless you try your luck and arrive early.  This is the new star on the steak house scene in town~Therealtruth22~New Hampshire
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We chose Lincoln Square because of the review and the location.   The five star reviews are absolutely justified.   We were celebrating a significant anniversary, and the hostess, waiter and the owner could not have been nicer.   The food is fantastic, great steaks and sides.  We were provided with complimentary appetizers, complimentary desserts, and then the waiter Eldon (extremely attentive and knowledgeble) brought out a cake with ice cream and a candle.   The hostess had a camera and took a picture, and a few minutes later we had a lovely photo of our group, with very nivpce note from Bruno, the owner.  To top it off, Bruno came around at the end of the meal with hugs for all.  It was a most memorable 40th celebration.   We will be back again.   I highly recommend it formboth the food and the people.  A great New York restaurant.~NHtraveler2213~Portsmouth, New Hampshire
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a wonderful evening celebrating my grandsons 21st birthday.   Great food cooked to perfection.   The service was excellent.  Would thoroughly recommend it . Very reasonable priced.  ~enagriffin~Welwyn Garden City, United Kingdom
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were looking for a steak house close by and this was one that came up on our search. Some mixed reviews but generally good so we went for it.  We were fairly early in the evening. The place was clean and contemporary. A nice ambiance. The service was very good, as you would expect for the location. They didn't have the wine I ordered but offered a more expensive one at the same price which although not significantly different I thought was good service. The sides were not too big but certainly ample. Well cooked and tasty. The steaks we had were excellent. The price was reasonable.~Robert B~The Hague, The Netherlands
Lincoln Square Steak~7616347~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well done  Great steakhouse experience  A little pause in service at the end was ameliorated by a complementary grappa digestive.~David C~Greensboro, North Carolina, United States
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best meal that we had while in Portland.  Very busy, make a reservation.  Service was quick and friendly.  Central location in down town area.  Not cheap, but worth the money~David G~Branford, Connecticut
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came to Portland for a long weekend and found Little Bird on the Trip Advisor site.  We always look for a special restaurant on our trips and Little Bird definitely fit that bill!!!  We made reservations and it was a good thing as it was very crowded even on a Thursday evening.  We told the hostess it was my birthday and they complied with a balcony seat - primo!  We enjoyed the cheese plate that our waiter, Matt, gleefully explained to us and it was delicious.   Matt also helped us choose a Beaujolais wine that nicely complimented our meal. My wife always orders the duck whenever it is offered, but this time she chose the pork shoulder that was tender and delicious!  I went with the daily special of Scallops which I always love.   The service is reminiscent of a French bistro - I would call it unhurried, not slow.  We had ample time to enjoy each course, and the view from the balcony.    I definitely recommend Little Bird because of the atmosphere as well as the delicious meal that we enjoyed!~talkslikeaduck~Santa Clarita, California
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Exceptional French inspired food. We've heard rave reviews for some time but this was our first visit. Opt for a mezzanine table if one is available. Wonderful experience~Twochefs66~Portland, Oregon
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friends were visiting from out of state and I saw all the great reviews of Little Bird as a lunchplace, so we took this opportunity to finally check the place out.  Verdict: scrumptious.  Not cheap but superb.  I had their French version of a ham sandwich, my wife had the salad with lamb, friends had the daily special (butternut squash with goat and all kinds of goodies),l another had the double brie burger and the last the shrimp sandwich.  Raves all round!  We still have to try dinner here -- and will.~DeHypnotist~Portland, Oregon
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great ambiance, good wine selection, good starter (for US-produced charcuterie - I live in France, so I'm spoiled). I was a bit disappointed in my main dish. I had the gnocchi, but there really wasn't a great taste contrast. Overall good experience however, and my Portland friends swear by this place, so it is definitely worth a try.~annashoe~Nantes, France
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Little Bird is one of the nicest little restaurants in Portland.  The food is excellent, fresh and well presented well.  The restaurant has a comfortable and relaxed feel.  Although relaxed, it's a fine dining experience.~GP_SteveL~Grants Pass, Oregon
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I enjoyed our best meal during our Portland visit at Little Bird. Recommendations from friends and social media lead us to this charming bistro. The food was amazing!!! We decided to skip the entrees and make a meal of starters. We were not disappointed. After nearly 20 years in SF it was a shock to walk out of Little Bird stuffed to our feathers with delicious food and interesting wine for the price we did. Forget the negative reviews you've read about the staff. They were super friendly and attentive. Great suggestions from our server. Next time we are in Portland you can find us here. Tip: do not leave without trying the bone marrow... it's off the hook!!~ShamrockGo~San Francisco
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I stopped in for brunch during our trip, this was a great decision.  The food choices were classic with a nice unique touch and there were plenty of them.  The staff was very friendly and the service great and the wait was not too long.  This is definitely a place I'd recommend if you are craving a solid breakfast. ~Courtney M~Saint Louis, Missouri
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So glad we selected Little Bird Bistro for one of our two dinner spots while visiting Portland. It had a Paris bistro lively feel and menu reminiscent of the Left Bank. The seared duck breast was exceptional as was the hanger steak. The wait staff are a real team, each attentive to every table.  I was glad to be able to express our appreciation to the on-site owner. Reservations are a must, it's small and popular.~Helene C~Indianapolis, Indiana
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is quaint restaurant with a French-themed interior.  The waiter was extremely friendly and so knowledgeable about wine and their wine list.  He made a fabulous recommendation for our meals.  The mains were the egg/mushroom dish and the daily special of scallops.  The scallop dish was wonderful with couscous and this perfect sauce.  The egg dish was very rich and delicate.  It reminded me of dish you get in France.  Overall it was a great meal.~FuzzyBeaver~Montreal, Canada
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visiting Portland and found reviews about Little Bird Bistro on TripAdvisor. Glad we made a reservation for a Saturday night. We were seated upstairs ( the best place to be). Reasonably priced wines by the glass and delicious French bread. We each had a cup of the soup of the day - split pea  - delicious. My husband had the pork shoulder, which he said was a little dry. I had the hanger steak au poivre. Delicious and tender, but it came with French fries and the portion was huge. Overall a great dining experience. A little noisy so sitting upstairs helps.~Jane D~Frederick, Maryland
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We found this place last year while on vacation and had one of the best meals we've ever had. Unfortunately this time around it can be summed up as "ok".  Service was excellent as was the bone marrow appetizer. However, the fois gras was just weird. Overpowered by the parsnip on parsnip on parsnip.  The duck main course was excellent, however the scallop feature was again a strange concept.....fresh, big, beautiful diver scallops straight out of the ocean and then destroyed with a dehydrated scallop volute poured over top. You just poured salty concentrated scallop juice all over a stunning delicate piece of shellfish.  Perhaps it was an 'off night' and perhaps our menu selection was also unlucky, but for a place to get 4 or 5 stars, it needs to not have a Russian Roulette menu.~643PennyB~Kelowna, Canada
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went with two close business colleagues for dinner. Very cool spot with two levels, very casual. Ordered the steak tartare and fried chicken coq au vin. Both were flavorful with terrific presentation. Service was excellent and well informed.   Good wine list - highly recommend it~Evan R~Basking Ridge, New Jersey
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a surprise!  We overheard this place mentioned in the lobby of our hotel.  It's a good thing we arrived early because without reservations we would not have gotten in.  By the time we left the place was packed and there was a line outside.  The food was reasonably price, nicely presented, tasty and hot.  Wait staff was good without being over anxious.  We'd recommend this always but consider getting reservations if you're not early or very late.~dthomas34~Huron, South Dakota
Little Bird Bistro~2140471~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~great food, great service and great atmosphere.  WE went to celebrate n occasion and it was perfect !!~SnowSurfer4Ever~Denver, Colorado
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Actually, I was not able to eat here. This place is supposed to be about the best BBQ in Phoenix. I went there for lunch on a Friday at about noon. There was no place to park in the parking lot and the attendant said the wait was about 90 minutes. Since I was going to be in the area the next day, I left and planned to come back when they opened at 11 am Saturday. When I returned, not only was the parking lot still full, but the attendant said the wait was over two hours. He said that Saturday mornings are the busiest and that the line starts forming around 9 am. Very disappointed.~Willy1043~Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great BBQ. Get there early they usually do sell out, there is usually a line, Seating inside and out. Really cute place. Not only the great smoked meats but the BBQ beans are to die for!~ivoryhoofranch~Phoenix, Arizona
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been several times and discover a new taste each time.  Best place and if you order by the pound, you can email the order in for pickup.   The lines allow you to get a full appreciation of the smoking and tempts your taste buds. I usually order my lunch and a meal for later.~Vicki M~Phoenix, Arizona
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just just gotten off a plane, jumped in my rental (look into Silvercar btw) and headed to Little Miss BBQ.  Line was about 30 people deep at 12pm on a Wednesday.  I didn't care, I wanted some brisket.  I'm from the southeast, so BBQ to me means pork.  Getting good brisket can be difficult to find, so once I heard they had good brisket, I had to come.  The line took about 30 minutes, but they came out to make sure people grabbed waters (in the cooler beside the line) and offered up "samples" of their house-made sausage - I put sample in quotes because I ended up with like 3 pieces.  I got in and order 2 meat plate and went with lean brisket (they were out of fatty/wet) and pork rib.  Side was grits and slaw.  That Brisket..... tender as a new mother holder her baby for the first time.  My mouth made noises that made others around me look and wonder what was going on.  Envision a male version of that scene in When Harry met Sally.  It was that good.  Rib - Excellent Slaw - felt I needed some sort of vegetables, but was too full to eat much of it.  Good though Grits - surprisingly tasty.  Again I'm from the south, so I'm picky about my grits.  All-in-all I will likely eat here every chance I have when I am in town, and I would suggest others to as well.  Just don't expect a quick lunch, and leave time for a nap after.~WilsonUGA~Statham, Ga
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was in Phoenix on business and had a chance to try out this family owned restaurant.  The decor isn't 5 star, but the food and value is.   There was a line to get in which is a testament to its smokey masterpieces and the service was very friendly.   I'd go back and recommend it wholeheartedly.~Christopher D~Oakton, Virginia
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I you are a central Texas bbq purist, then this is the place. Hands down the best bbq in Arizona.  One of the few BBQ restaurants in Arizona that use a true wood-fired offset smoker to cook on.  No propane, No Southern Pride "smoker", no Old Hickory "smoker" - just wood.  Its worth the wait day in and day out.   Get the potato salad and vinegar slaw as sides.~Chris P~Phoenix, Arizona
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've visited 3 times and always had to wait in line. So that becomes part of the experience. Talked to people ahead and behind - people are generally excited to see for themselves what the buzz is about. The food is delicious and not drowned in sauce - you add the sauce you want and the amount you want. You get pure meat and sides. Will return again when it gets cooler.~Marilyn Z~Phoenix
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Little Miss BBQ is a hole in the wall with 3 massive smokers of industrial grade.  The smell ropes you in from the road.  The hours are from 11:00 AM until 4:00 PM or until they run out.    Since we did not know the area, we arrived 15 minutes early before they opened and the parking lot was full (it is a very small lot) and the line had formed.  So here's the drill...the parking lot traffic patrol suggests that the people in your car get out and wait in line.  You then drive out of the lot turning to the right, find a safe place to U turn, come back and wait in the center median turn lane until someone leaves and you can then take your parking place when the lot supervisor tells you to.  I waited in that median 38 minutes.  The people that came up behind me did not know why I was just sitting there and a couple got really annoyed and went around me only to discover why I was just sitting there.  They then had to get in line behind me and wait too.  Once parked, I joined my group in line and waited another 20 minutes.  The menu is on the fence while you wait in line so there is no excuse not to know what you want when you finally get to the counter.  Everything is fabulous and well worth the wait!!!!  OMG.  One of our friends judges BBQ contests on the East Coast and he said this was by far the best BBQ he's had, especially the brisket.  He said it was 'Artful".  He was not a fan of the sauces, he thought the original should be sweeter.  I thought it was fine, and actually prefer not to pour heavy sweet sauce on my meats.  I had the Jefe sandwich with pulled pork, I can highly recommend that with the jalapeno grits (it was not spicy hot).  The men had a pound of ribs and a pound of brisket and devoured every bit.  They did not get sides as it was so much meat.  There are bottled and canned drinks available.  Once you make it past the counter and order line, there is limited seating in the air-conditioned dining room, or you can take your plates outside to the shaded picnic area.  There is not a lot of breeze out there and it is near the smokers.  The turn around time for the tables goes pretty quickly.  We finally got out of there at about 1:00 PM and the line was very short by then and there was plenty of parking.  I am not sure how much meat they had left but had I known their peak hours during the week (we were there on a Wednesday) I would have arrived about 12:45 or 1:00.  Excellent food though!!!  If I lived in Phoenix, Little Miss BBQ would become a ritual dining event.~Peggy W~Tampa, Florida
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My neighbor kept telling me about Little Miss and yesterday we finally made it.  While he accurately described what to expect, until I went there myself I didn't fully get it.  Little Miss BBQ isn't just food, its an outing, an experience, an event.    We arrrived late, about 11:30 and the line was already pretty long.  My friend had prepared me so I wasn't surprised by the wait...but it did end up being 2 hours in line.  The Little Miss crew kept us hydrated, shade and misters kept us comfortable, we were given some samples of smoked sausage to keep us motivated, and the best was Scott's (the owner) dad struck up a conversation with us in the line and told us the history of the restaurant - it was really a cool story and experience.  The closer we got to the door the more hungry we were - the BBQ aromas wafting out the door were AMAZING!!  The whole place is perfect - just what you would expect from an authentic Texas BBQ joint - the menu is written on cardboard and it was fun trying to figure out the perfect ordering strategy.  I ended up ordering a beef short rib (special for the day).  They were HUGE but the staff was patient and accommodating and helped find one under a pound for me.  I also had to try the brisket (the fatty brisket was sold out so I had the lean), and the smoked turkey.  I paired my meats with the Jalapeno Cheese Grits and the Ranch Style Beans.  I ordered a brisket and pork rib platter for my daughter.  I also could not resist ordering 2 of Bekke's Smoked Pecan Pies.  Let me just say the wait was worth it!  The meats were juicy and tender and I can't even describe how delectable the outside where the rub had crusted was.  OMG!  Amazing doesn't even really come close.  I was at Little Miss with a group of friends and we had no trouble snagging a picnic table in the shade for our feast.  We had so much fun and we all had leftovers to take home as well.  Next time I'll probably order ahead - there is a minimum 5# order but share it with a few neighbors and you will have a feast to go.    I can't wait to see what Scott and Bekke come up with next - they could be a really dynamic force in the Phoenix food market.~AZVAL~Scottsdale, Arizona
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I were really looking forward to trying Little Miss BBQ during our long Labor Day holiday weekend visit to Phoenix.  We were also interested in comparing the food to Franklin's BBQ in Austin that we visited last year.  We did an email pre-order for fatty and lean brisket, beef ribs, sausage, and pecan pies to avoid the line and any sell out disappointment.  The food was quality was outstanding, and the taste and flavor exceeded our expectations.    We also got to meet Scott and Quinton and the crew.  They obviously work very hard, but they are all very nice and fun, too.  For the record, Sally thought the LMBBQ brisket was better than Franklin's, and I thought all of the food was just as good if not better as well.  In our opinion, LMBBQ is not just a contender and they definitely excel at their craft.  We also brought along a carry-on sized Coleman cooler that arrived empty and went home full, and we were very glad that we did.  Final thought, save some room for the pecan pie!~stoandgmt412~Redondo Beach, CA
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Small place, poor parking, incredible BBQ.  Fat or lean brisket is the best.  Get there as early as they open or you'll have trouble parking and no place to sit~Tom G~Rio Verde, Arizona, United States
Little Miss Bbq~6380620~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is no other restaurant in the world that I can imagine standing in line for in 110 degree heat. Folks do that daily at Little Miss Bbq, and for good reason. The array of wonderfulness is right inside the door, and the staff are as wonderful as the food.     My personal taste is pulled pork with North Carolina-style vinegar sauce.They have that sauce, and they are the only ones in Phoenix that do it right, but you have to ask for it.~kcp4art~Phoenix, Arizona
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A first visit to LoPorto recently was for a Holiday / year end dinner for about 30 people. Right from start with the large plattered hot and cold appetizers to the main course large platters, the quality, flavor, and freshness of all the food was superb. I grew up with Italian families and worked in an Italian restaurant in upstate New York. But, until LoPorto, never tasted numerous Italian dishes any better than theirs.~Robert L~Schenectady
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend gave us a gift card and spouse and I had a feast! Loved it all - good wine menu...good salad...excellent entrees and enough left over for two meals for two afterwards! It's everything an old-fashioned Italian eatery should be. ~Janet D~Troy, New York, United States
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although everyone  in my party ordered a different dish, all arrived floating in a gravy. There was no way to distinguish veal piccata from veal saltimbocca from chicken cacciatore. They were all drenched in the same "gravy", Everything looked the same. If this is "authentic" Italian cuisine, something is amiss. Dreadful.~bullklages~Santa Monica, California
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this little place. It's vibe reminds me of an old world Italian restaurant. You'll often see the owner, Michael, chatting with the regulars, and making sure you're happy with everything. Every entree I've ever had has been delicious- sea food, veal, steak- and the servings are amazingly generous. The vegetables and the sides are always cooked perfectly. I don't think I've ever been able to finish a meal. Another gem found in Troy, New York. ~Nancy M~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm not one that usually gives a restaurant five stars but considering all factors this establishment deserves that rating.  Myself and a friend had dinner at this Italian restaurant on Monday night. It was raining heavily but that did not deter the multitude of the regulars from arriving for their reservations.  This place is totally old school Italian.  Michael LoPorto, executive chef/owner, greeted us warmly and spent time with us before and after the meal.  The food was prepared to order and both veal dishes were delicious and came with vegetable, salad and side of pasta. So much food that I had to take the entire pasta dish home with me. The price point for the quality and quantity of the food they serve is exceptionally fair if not underpriced.  Wait staff was engaging and courteous.  I will definitely return on my next trip to Troy.~Ralph A~Dorado, Puerto Rico
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's been quite awhile since I've had the pleasure of dining at Loporto's Restaurant in Troy and boy have I missed it.  I had the chicken Milanese and my Mother had the Veal Guiseppe both dishes were phenominal.  I called talk all day about how fabulous their bread dipping oil too.  I cannot wait to go back.~laura p~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located only two blocks from the famous Troy Music Hall, this restaurant aims to please, especially if you call ahead and let them know you're going to a concert.  We sat in front in the two-level restaurant and had excellent entrees. I had calamari bathed in their special sauce. Very enjoyable.~John B~Slingerlands, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not being offensive but it looks like a hole in the wall.  Went for lunch.  Bread seems homemade. Everything was ultra fresh. Lunch meeting so didn't look at wine list, but they do have a full bar.  Food was great!  Would love to try them for dinner.~hockeygump~Connecticut
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Rome, Venice, Florence an d Naples have nothing on Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe. Pasta like you dream of and ambiance that reminds one of Italy. Chianti and Sambuca complement every meal.~Robert J~Melrose, NY
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Best Western we were staying  in recommend Lo Porto.   Telling us the servings were large.   The servings were large and the taste excellent.   Great service as well.~Joe T~Brentwood, California
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This a cute Italian Restaurant that been around for a while, food and service is good. Great Chix parm dinners!~David B~Rotterdam, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is Troy! If you haven't been here and you live in Troy. What are you doing with your life. Get it together people. Place is authentic and delicious. The Guinies outside will tell you the same. Eat up!~RonnySlamawics~Albany, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was amazing. It looks like an outdated little hole in the wall from the street but it goes so far back and up that it's actually pretty big. It's definitely family run and you can really feel how dedicated to it they are. The food rivals anything from little Italy or the north end. It's a little pricey but when you realize that each plate is actually 2 or 3 meals worth of food, it is a deal you can't pass up. I can't wait to go back!~Rob M~Plymouth, Massachusetts
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Until this last visit to Troy's Lo Porto Restaurant we were convinced it was the best Italian restaurant in the Capital District of New York. However, our last experience has made us go away with mixed feelings. No criticism of the entree I chose. My very generous portion of Veal Cacciatore was delicious and the doggie bag I took home, heated up the next day,  was equally good.  My husband, however, was not so lucky. He had picked the Frutti del Mare and though the seafood, mostly consisting of calamari rings on linguini in a tomato sauce, was plentiful, all of it was very, very chewy and obviously over cooked and heated up. This is obviously not a dish we would never choose again in this normally excellent eatery. The parking on busy 4th Street, by the way, but can be quite challenging.~Renate B~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been coming here since 2013-each time we are in the area and visit our son we always go here for dinner. This is real Italian food. Everything is always amazing. Staff is always friendly and accommodating~Nancy1092~Wenonah, New Jersey
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to Lo Portos to celebrate a good friends birthday.  The service was great.  Our food was outstanding. Three of us had the pasta with vodka sauce with shrimp.  It was outstanding and we all had lunch for the next day.  Great place to celebrate or have an outstanding Italian meal.~Fez H~Troy, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yes, it looks like a dive from the outside.  However, it's a very good Italian restaurant inside.  Request seating in the balcony.  We tend to visit several times a year.  My favorite is Linguine Con Vongole -- just wonderful!~LakeRecluse~Grafton, New York
Lo Porto Ristorante Caffe~420193~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can't beat this place.The food is cooked to order and it's Fabulous! I am Italian and have been brought up on this kind of food.its exactly like my mothers cooking!! I highly recommend this place.you will leave with lots and lots of leftover so bring your appetites ! The Cristaldi's :)~Susan C~Boston, United States
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Chose this restaurant for dinner on 5th November after reading the great reviews on Tripadvisor  The restaurant was busy but we managed to get a table (for 2) without having to wait. I chose the Tavern Beer and Cheddar Soup to start, the LT Signature Burger (without chips) for mains and the Red Wine Poached Pear with Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert. The server was friendly, efficient and new detail of all menu items. Apart from the soup being perhaps a little too thick a consistency everything else was cooked just right. I had asked for the burger to be cooked medium rare and it was perfect - a real taste sensation wth the garlic, the branded mushrooms, cheese and the bacon jam offset by the slight sweetness of the brioche bun.~Irmgard H~Corby, United Kingdom
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and we had great service from our waitress Angie. Definitely recommend - was great for the kids. ~Aniaschwartz~River vale 
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, great cocktails, great service!!! And the happy hour ended up being AWESOME!!!! Isaiah & Aida were GREAT!!!!~flygirl_luvjonz~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, service and atmosphere, just what we needed after travelling since 5:00 am and Logan's delivered - more than helped by smilie server Angie C!~Rod H~Berkeley, United Kingdom
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had dinner here one evening, service was truly excellent, the food was great and not expensive (IMHO) for what we had, sadly I am not a permanent resident in DC or I would have been back here by now.  Keep up the good work !!~JGDerYak~Surrey
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had the fried calamari as a starter. Probably the best fried calamari I've ever had. Followed by the meatloaf. Was also good, but only order if you are hungry! Very filling.   They were busy (was midweek) and service was a bit lacking. But in all a good meal. ~VinceDarwin~Darwin
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I almost went to Logan's last night due to the high ratings and the proximity, but ended up at a so so Thai place (more on that in another post).  I wanted to rectify the Thai let down so I went with the  "sure thing" based on the reviews.  every thing was ok, but just ok.  the setting was nice and the service was very good, but the food was just bland.  I could have hit is on a bad night, perhaps the kitchen was caught up in the first game of the Series, whatever the reason, it was disappointing enough not to give it another try.~leavingAZ2011~Boston, Massachusetts
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I wanted to find a place to watch the baseball playoffs when in town for business. My hotel had a sports bar, but the menu didn't look great. I decided to come here after reading the reviews on trip advisor. The Beer Cheese Soup was amazing. It was very filling and came with a basket of bread. I planned on ordering more food, but it filled me up. I tried the Founder's Punch cocktail as well, but it was too sweet for me. I would love to come back again for the soup.~MDF_U2~Irvine, California, United States
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I will preface this by saying maybe its my southern palette.  Maybe it was a bad night.  Maybe I just can't recognize good food.  So please read with all caveats applied.  This was among the worst tasting meals I've had in years.  We had two appetizers, some southwestern style fried rolls and something called mozzarella toast.  The rolls were disappointing when they arrived, and the fact that they were the best part of the meal was something I would not have guessed.  The mozzarella toast was as bad a dish (appetizer or otherwise) that I have ever eaten in my life.  We assumed when ordering it would be a cheese stick type arrangement.  What showed up was two pieces of bread with some cheese on it, possibly spinach, and some other identifiable things.  It had just come out of the cooler.  Maybe they forgot to warm, I dont know.  It was inedible, and as my family can attest I say that about very few things which I have purchased.  The entree I had was some type of fried breast of chicken. It was advertised as being on cheese grits.  I am a lifelong resident of the south, and as such am a subject matter expert on grits.  These were not good.  The chicken was ok, but fairly bland.  The kids had burgers.  They were also bland and seasonless.  The buns had some type onion on them.  My wife had the southern fried chicken on garlic mashed potatoes.  They were ok, the chicken seemed more bland than what I had, but her potatoes were better than my grits.  The restaurant was really nice, and had a cool vibe.  Our server was great (tho I would've appreciated a better description of the mozzarella toast, and I specifically asked).  Adding insult to injury was what it cost.  It was expensive.  We ate at several other 'american' style places over our visit and enjoyed them all.  This place is obviously popular and well reviewed, so maybe it was just us.  Your mileage may vary~Brad J~Graceville
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I work about a half a mile from this restaurant. We have a lot of places to choose from but this is one of our favorites. The food is excellent and fresh. The service is very good. If it's a nice day you can sit outside. Also they have great options for people with food allergies. They've custom made me a burger wrapped in lettuce but they also offer gluten free buns. They easily make swaps for healthier options. It's truly one of our favorite places~Alicyn~Alexandria, Virginia
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely ambience. Cool decor. Waiting staff are very friendly and accommodating. Burgers are very tasty and they offer a wide selection of drinks. A great, good value meal. ~Tracey N~Norwich, United Kingdom
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has some great food at reasonable prices.  Not to chabby, nice atmosphere, great place to lunch.~ktball2016~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Logan Tavern~481021~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stayed nearby at The Holiday Inn and wanted to grab a quick bite after driving in rush hour traffic.  We decided on The Logan Tavern based on positive reviews and its proximity to our hotel.  We did not have reservations and had to wait for 30 minutes for a table which was fine (and exactly how long we waited).  It took awhile to get our order in and we were starving, seriously.  Also, two of our orders were missing certain add-ons for which we were not charged thankfully.  The restaurant tables are covered in butcher paper and they have a kids menu and crayons which entertained all of us.  The restaurant is very loud so probably not the best place for those with hearing impairments.  Overall a good experience but took awhile to get the good.  The drinks were great (we had beer and a Cosmo) and the food was very good--we had the tomato soup, grilled cheese, BLT burger, and The Fall Panzanella salad.~EleanoreE~Baltimore, Maryland
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Before I went to this place, I thought tacos were pretty much the same anywhere but Los Tacos No. 1 taught me different. Their adobado (marinated) pork is especially good. They also make quesadilla tacos, which is not something I've seen elsewhere, and they're also very good.~M_Norstein~San Diego, California
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First time to Los Tacos, great tacos.  I was impressed on how well run it was. The line may be long but it moves fast.~Cindy L~Bismarck, North Dakota
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I came here recently with my partner and it was so good... we came back for another within minutes. This place is lovely and very authentic. It's cheap and quick food that is full of flavour. If you like Tacos. You absolutely need to visit this gem!~albcx~Derbyshire, United Kingdom
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I read about this place on the plane to New York and it was the first place we ate at during our three weeks in the USA. I'm writing this review after those three weeks and various tacos eaten in New York and California. I can say for sure that these tacos were easily the best we had. Really fresh tasting. There is a simple choice of  menu but that's no bad thing in this sort of place. There's no seafood but a sister restaurant has now opened next door so you can try that too. I thought the adobe pork was my favourite but the chicken was good too - we chose the corn tortillas.   Los Tacos is basically a take away so you might queue to buy them but once you've ordered it comes straightaway - they assemble it in front of you at the counter. So don't go expecting an evening meal but do go if you want really tasty tacos. Chelsea Market is worth a trip more generally and there are quite a few other places to eat and drink. Worth combining with a walk on the Highline. ~Segaria226~London, United Kingdom
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was referred by a local. Line moved fast. Recommended to get the quesadilla especial add chicken. Very good but smaller than I expected. Excellent crust and cheese combo. Guacamole was outstanding, but tortilla chips a bit hard and no salt. Also tried chicken taco, pretty good, fresh cilantro made it. There are limes, pics de gallo, and hot sauces for topping. No room to sit and eat, had to go back out to market to standing table to eat.~Holly C~Cincinnati, Ohio
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice mexican snack ! recommended to get the tostadas 'adobada' and  quesadillas ' pollo asada ' were really good !  the place is in the CHELSEA MARKET! try the place!~KatlynSanchez~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not much to say but wow. I love Mexican food and try it every time I get a chance everywhere I go including Mexico. The tortillas are hand made and always made in the moment. For me the carne asada tacos and the pollo asado quesadillas are the best I had. I come here every time I'm in NYC even if I don't have anything to do in the Chelsea area. Give them a try. ~PRcontributor~Guaynabo, Puerto Rico
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best tasting tacos I've ever had. Located inside the Chelsea Market, lines are usually long but don't take more than 10 minutes. The downside of the location is there are no seats or a place for you to eat. Very vey busy spot. Good luck if you have dietary restrictions.. ~Cotuprado~Toronto, Canada
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our favourite meal in NYC (annoying when this was $22 total compared to our most expensive meal of $150!)   We tried the pork, chicken and steak - Pork and steak were the favourites  Seriously delicious! This trip made us walk through Chelsea market which I had no idea was so nice so it was well worth the trip without even trying the tacos - but then we ate the tacos and it made our day lol.  Shame there's no seats, but otherwise taco perfection!~tanewman~England
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Saw this place in the corner while going to another restaurant for lunch. The long line instantly caught my attention.  We came back for dinner that night and I'm so glad we did.  Service: Fast and straight to the point.  Food: Now mind you I'm from the states and we normally eat tacos with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes...all the fixings. There is none of that here and I thought my taco would be disgusting. I have been missing out. Fresh tortillas, delicious mouth watering beef with a sprinkle of cilantro. I ordered two and chips and salsa. I could have eaten 7983084383 of those things. Two weeks later and I'm still day dreaming about them.  If you ever get a chance to visit NYC, please make the stop. You will NOT be disappointed.~Temiekam~Atlanta, Georgia
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is not fast food, its good food fast! Me and my husband shared a chicken and steak taco, there is a reason this place is rammed because they were both delicious! If they set up a conveyer belt with these on i would need to be crane lifted out. Would recommend to everyone!!~BexCass~UK
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This places serves some great tacos and the lines ups are a testament to its quality. We were looking for Halal options or fish/shrimp tacos so didnt have much luck here. Their veg cactus taco was just ok but my friends who ate their chicken tacos loved it.~inferno16978~Oakville, Canada
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to this Taco stand in the Chelsea market because of its rave reviews. We don't get it. We stood in a line-up for 15 min. When it was our turn it was chaos as far as what we should order, and how much to order. The area was packed with people. When we finally got the tacos we couldn't find a place to eat them. We finally found a stand-up table. By then the tacos were barely warm and a soggy mess...definitely not hand food. The whole experience was searing. Avoid this place. We went there on a Saturday....at 4:00. Maybe it would be a different experience on a Monday.~nkrannitz~vancouver, canada
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yes you wait in line but that gives you time to decide what to order. the line moved up fairly quick, and the staff are great, they move quick. The Tacos are aaaaamazing. everything is fresh, tortillas, (get the corn!) salsa, meat. defiantly worth coming out here.~larnskeet~Miami Beach, Florida
Los Tacos No. 1~4578404~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the place is in Chelsea market, had a bit of a line, but moved quickly.  the taco was really good- the beef was very juicy and flavorful good experience, but a bit pricey~omribesor~Beersheba, Israel
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~All types of delicious Thai and Cambodian dishes as well as fresh yummy sushi rolls! My favorite dish is the Bee Bong! Favorite non-alcoholic drink--the Thai Iced Tea! Favorite alcoholic drink--the Pear martini! The staff here are always kind and helpful. I highly recommend this place if you're a sucker for delicious sushi and Asian foods!~Diane M~Whitesboro, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best sushi and noodles around. You also get a lot of food for your money. I am obsessed with their Nime chow spring roll appetizer. It comes with the best sauce.~Foodie418~Syracuse, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Breaking away from chain restaurants on the road and finding something interesting and local has become the primary pastime in my department, Lotus Garden fit the bill perfectly. My teammate and I actually went in on a whim; the cozy atmosphere (good ambience) and dinner specials made it a good choice!~Justin A~Dayton, Ohio
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Calamari was terrible, rubbery and couldn't chew it. Had tofu in my dish and it tasted rancid, mushrooms were not good either. Beer and wine were good, that's it!~Hilary B~Oakville
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I last had dinner here with a friend who is originally from Burma. She loves Thai food and the menu at the Lotus Garden is the real deal. Any dish can be tailored to your spice tolerance - mild to hot and tangy!~Susan S~Barneveld, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've eaten at The Lotus Garden dozens of times.  They service some truly excellent Asian cuisine at reasonable prices.  Full service bar is available: beer, wine, distilled spirits.~James C~Utica, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Someone from Utica mentioned this a MUST TRY place - well I'm glad I did!  The food here is simply amazing.   Try the bee-bong, and make sure to get the spring rolls.   They use the freshest ingredients and really put their heart and soul into the product.   ~Bill B~Utica, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The dishes are yummy.  I have tried several, but he Be bong is my favorite.  If you are downtown give it a try.~James L~Utica, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a simple, pleasant, and very reasonably priced restaurant. Great for lunch during a work day. Portions are not huge, but certainly satisfying. ~Ken W~Hamilton, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Trust me, its the first time I am writing a review about any restaurant!..We were on our way from Ogdensburg to Providence and passed by Utica. My wife did a quick search on the restaurant nearby and that's how we came to this place. The ambiance itself gave us the feel that we have landed at a decent place. We chose to sit by the bar and requested our meal. I went for Amok, the national dish of Combodia and my wife picked Pad thai. I have no second thought saying that it was one of the best meal I have ever had in that genre and similar was my wife's comments for the Pad Thai. So this place is undoubtedly foodie's delight. The servicing was very nice too, full marks to the bartender! Since we landed in non-rush hours, we even happened to meet the chef - Sam who was very warm and hospitable. We enjoyed conversation with him and he even presented us  complimentary Mochi which is again my favorite desert. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would like to go back if it comes our way!!~Rakesh K~Providence, Rhode Island
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very conveniently located in downtown Utica and a great place to eat before a show at the Stanley Theatre. Great variety in the menu and good friendly service. ~Ann K~New Hartford, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We brought our friends here for dinner, tonight. We shared a Jazz roll and a Kamikaze roll.  For appetizers we had the "ravioli" (gyoza) and calemari. Both were very enjoyable.   Mar had Lo mien, which she shared with us.  It was as good as always.  I had the Shanghai noodles, rather than my usual Pad Thai. It was delicious.   Our friends C and J shared a curry dish, which they enjoyed and didn't leave a bit to take home.   The food was all freshly made. Well worth the trip. We'll be back, again.  ~Brian F~Utica, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We go to the Lotus Garden at least once a month! Every meal has been delicious. We always look forward to date night at the Lotus Garden! ~Candice P~Utica, New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been to the Lotus garden several times and it's always great! Most of the time I've had the shrimp special. Hot and tangy and I don't want it to end. Reasonably priced too!~herovb~Upstate New York
Lotus Garden~1896529~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We try to get here often as it is one of our favorite places to have a delicious relaxed meal. The food is always excellent, and I have tried a number of dishes I might be afraid to taste at other locations. Portions are large and I almost never have room left for desert. We love bringing out of town guests here.~hilwoman~Utica, New York
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, huge portions, friendly and efficient service. What more could you ask for!

Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lou's is close to where I am staying and visited as it looked like a traditional breakfast restaurant without being a chain. It was everything I expected with the busy dining room and friendly waiting staff. Slightly confusing menu for an out-of-towner like me but really enjoyed the food and friendliness.~KCS~Zurich, Switzerland
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice place near downtown West of the River Good for breakfast and lunch for sure.Old time cafe on route 66  Great meatloaf~Roscoetravels~Henderson, Nevada

Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recommended as probably the best place for breakfast in Chicago as was not disappointed, this place is great from the moment you enter and grab a free mini donut to the great reception you get and followed by incredible service there is only one thing left and that's the food. We are just starting our journey from the start of Route 66 through the end in Santa Monica and could only wish that this quality of food could continue. The best must go back.~cr159~St. Petersburg, Florida
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Step 1 of having breakfast here, don't eat the night before because you want to be able to eat the whole menu it's so yummy.  Step 2 of having breakfast here - GET THE DONUT HOLES! Step 3 of having breakfast here - Waffle & Wings is the BEST THING EVER! Step 4 of having breakfast here - ice cream, oh the ice cream Step 5 of having breakfast here - don't have anything planned for the rest of the day as you won't be able to move.  Best Breakfast Ever!!!  The queue was long, very long. But so worth the wait.~hannahclark16~Droitwich, United Kingdom
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The family was in town with an out of town guest so we had to stop for one of the best breakfast in town!!! Portion are huge. All the bakery is fresh. Had an omelette with some Greek toast. Topped this with the homemade orange marmalade. So good!  ~Christy N~Chicago, Illinois
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We left Chicago on Saturday to drive Route 66 and had to begin at Lou Mitchell's!  The Spinach special omelette is amazing. Honestly,  I have never had one so delish and fluffy!  The staff have all been there for years.  Actually, Mickey, our waitress had only been there 15 years and that was less than most all!  Food is great, staff is great!~tootski~Franklin, Tennessee
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to last Cubs game of regular season. Talked with the guy who sat next to us at game and he asked if we had been here yet? He talked up so we decided to try the next day. The wife and I really enjoyed and had a few glasses of the Orange juice. The food was good and pretty quick service. Reminds me of a restaurant from the 60's 70's era.if you want to chow down a good breakfast this place will not let you down.the milk duds and donut holes a nice bonus!!!!~shiner00747~Columbus, Ohio
Lou Mitchell's Restaurant~427842~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Were here for breakfast this morning & waited 10mins for a coffee. The food was ok but the hostess was very rude and abrupt. When taking payment she cheekily rounded up the total for a bigger tip too. There's plenty of other much better diners to check out in Chicago-avoid this one!~Ted C~Dublin, Ireland
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A wide variety of wines coupled with meat and cheese platters that represent a wide array of local farms.  A great night out!~Christine R~Valatie, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A year ago a really hip place with good food and ok service. Now? Very limited food selection and what there is is unappitizing. The wine makes no prevention of being good except for the price. The service has gone from mediocre to awful. Go across th street to the Illum for. Great expirience..~558renater~Delmar
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cool wine Bar with reclaimed wood, light great light food and wine. Nice dim, cool lighting, good wine list with good wine at a reasonable price. Unique cheeses and charcuterie.~Billsfun7~Latham, New York, United States
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I along with a few friends hosted a baby shower for 39 people here last weekend.  We had gone to great lengths to communicate the details of the event with the event coordinator at Lucas Confectionery over the past 3 months.  This included 2 face to face meetings at the restaurant.  The coordinator, Andrea was very unresponsive and horrible at communicating.  That  should have been my clue that things would not go well. I could go on and on about all of the myriad of issues we had leading up to the event (a nightmare) but I will stick to the actual event. It was held in the Garden Patio which was clean, set up and ready on time for the event. We were promised 2 staff people but for most of the event there was only 1 (and remember there were 39 guests!). The cheese and chacuterie platter was horrible. The presentation was an embarrassment, there wasn't nearly enough of anything, there weren't proper serving utensils, there were terrible tiny wooden sticks for eating utensils, plastic plates and paper napkins.  There was salad and 3 "small plate" choices for the main course that were tasty but nowhere near enough to feed 39 women. Again, a huge embarrassment to invite guests and not have enough food for them.  Dessert was to be petit fours.  I had asked for more specifics on this many times but never got them.  I know why now - petit fours my a- - !  There was a small plate of quarter size cookies, that was it. The coordinator on the day was uncooperative and surly.  I have called to speak with the owner about our issues but to date have received no response. Please do NOT consider hosting an event at this place or Pecks Arcade. You will be disappointed.~Roxanne S~Niskayuna, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I cannot recommend this venue highly enough!  Kelly was our Event Planner & could not have been better.   Our Rehearsal Dinner was for 40 & was in the Garden Patio, which was stunning with the twinkling lights, votives everywhere and the unique waterfall.  Food & drinks were delicious and the staff was attentive to everything we needed.  We then opened up the doors to Lucas Confectionery for the Welcome Party (we think nearly 150 attended) so then had both spaces for a few more hours.   It was magical!  Cannot rave enough about our experience.   We were there for a total of 5 hours and never had to look for a server - every employee was friendly & helpful.   Loved it!~Patricia K~Amelia Island, Florida
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Lucas Confectionary so many times and it's honestly my favorite place in Troy. The wine is incredible, the cheese plates are delicious and the staff is so helpful and knowledgeable. I feel like I'm transported while at the Confectionary- the atmosphere is just so beautiful.~Beeinthestarts~Troy, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late night stop for dessert and drinks. We had a layered hazelnut mousse cake served in a mason jar. Amazing! Many wines to choose from. Great ambiance and service! ~gwizz~ft worth
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late night stop for dessert and sticks. We had a layered hazelnut mousse cake served in a mason jar. Amazing! Many wines to choose from. Great ambiance and service! ~gwizz~ft worth
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lucas Confectionary is a must stop on any wine lovers visit to downtown Troy!  The staff was friendly and knowledgable on both wines and charcuterie offerings.  Whether you sit inside, a very funky atmosphere, or in the outdoor patio fashioned with cool lighting, plants and reclaimed wood made into long communal tables, you will love your time at Lucas Confectionary!~AutumnLeave~North Carolina
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friends and I went to Lucas for a drink, while waiting for our dinner reservation at Peck's (which is part of the whole place).  After we got our first glass of wine, we went to Peck's, and after our dinner, we went back to Lucas for another glass of wine. While we were sitting there and sipping our wine, a waitress came and ask us, if wanted to order something more. We said no, since we just ate at their "sister" restaurant, and we kept sipping on our wine.  After 15 minutes, a blond woman approached us, and asked we were ordering something more? At that point we weren't, because all of us had 2 glasses of wine and we had to drive home. Well, not ordering anything more, WE GOT KICKED OUT! Unbelievable! Bottom line, 15 minutes earlier, when waitress was asking us if we wanted to order something, has never mentioned about our table being reserved, yet since we didn't want to drink anymore, out of nowhere, we were asked to leave, because apparently our table was reserved... I guess, at this place, if you din't drink a lot, you can't stay on promises.~eve09092014~Saratoga Springs, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best places in Troy to take your date. Great ambiance and decor and very good wines. Even the tea is very good here!  They do the 'painting in the pub' in the backyard which is awesome!~aritra90~Troy, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Read about this wine bar on Facebook. We were looking at trying something new and when you combine wine and cheese, well it's game on. Met some friends, parking is on street but adequate. We were there during the evening on the weekend and found parking on the street. The wine bar is really attractive, trendy but comfortable and subdued. Great vibe there, staff very courteous, knowledgable on the wines. The wine selection is very good, we sat at the outside patio, really liked the setting. The wine bar has a dog friendly policy which I think is great. Saw cute pup when we were there. They have a great cheese and meat selection. Prices were decent for quality and service. I highly recommend trying it and we will make this wine bar a regular spot for us. If I had more than two thumbs I would give it many more thumbs up. ~rabump~Schenectady, NY
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a wonderful wine bar that gives you a real sense of being in NYC. You are transported 3 hours downstate once you step inside.~joesatthev~Troy, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tonight we decided to finally try out the wine bar in Troy. First time, a Saturday night around 9:00pm. We entered into the candle lit restaurant to a light buzz and a pretty rockin' sound track (sounded like an 80s alternative pandora station that fit the mood perfectly). Our goal was simply a glass of wine and dessert.  The patio was unfortunately booked for a private party (noting they rent out the patio...) so we 'belly up'd' to the bar. Eric was our bartender, who was personable and very informative. Firstly, their water is infused with fruit. What a wonderful surprise to have grapefruit and orange infused water (They change this on an availability basis).   Their menu is fantastically whelming! Not too many pages and items, but enough for some variety. We chose the Riesling, dry, crisp, with a mild citrus tang, and the Tempranillo, a lovely tart flavor. We ended up getting a cheese plate prior to the dessert. Their Eleven Brothers, Cremont, and Invierno. Great cheeses and the accompanying sauces/jams were delectable. Great pairings.  Finally, for the dessert we originally intended on, we chose the Nutella and chocolate mousse in a mason jar. Killer. The decadence we'd hoped for.  All in all, and utterly stellar first impression for a highly regarded establishment. Great atmosphere, delicious treats, fantastic wine. We are looking forward to another visit soon.  -CKV~CKVine~Albany, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever we go to Troy, the Lucas Confectionery is top of the list to go for a drink and conviviality, conversation and new friends. Cool interior. Imaginative use of materials. Something new happening all the time from showers to evening drawing sessions. Nicely presented, and tasty cheese and charcuterie. Efficient and friendly staff. Top drawer fun.~Q. C~Trumansburg, New York
Lucas Confectionery~3645914~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Why would a wine bar have only 6 red and six white wines by the glass?  There had to be close to 200 wines by the bottle though. At a wine bar I want a broad selection by the glass and not at NYC prices. The cheapest red by the glass was $10. How about a wine 'flight' to sample a few different wine? This is not a place for dinner per se, but they have some cheese, charcuterie, and desserts to choose from if you want to nibble while sipping. ~cpjrod510~c.p.
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great experience here across the board! Food and service were fantastic. Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. ~gsleasman~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, great staff, great place!  Come for the history and reviews, leave with wonderful memories & having made new friends!  Amongst our group of 25+, not a bad dish.  All wonderful!!  The private room is like someone's personal living/dining room.  Great ambiance.  ~Passport-Maven~La Canada Flintridge, California
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last night we arrived at Mamma Mia's at about 5 PM. Didn't have a reservation but they found a table without much of a wait. Sat upstairs. The cocktails were excellent but the two entrees were amazing. My wife had the scallops and I had the swordfish. The taste of both dishes definitely had the "wow" factor. The wait staff were cordial, attentive and friendly. A couple of cappacinos topped it off. Great evening.~CarlosIII~Wakefield, Mass
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located in an old home, this restaurant serves not only Italian food, but also international dishes as well, all superbly cooked, extensive wine list, desert wines, grappa, etc that I have rarely seen outside of Italy.  Really a great culinary experience.~DocAndyHouston~Tampa, Florida
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely decor with hand painted frescos (at least where we sat).  Service: perfect. It's a high class joint, but I even opted for beer over wine (I'd done the Sam Adams beer tour earlier). And everything was cool. The waiter even gave my wife a cheeky half-glass top-up when she didn't want a full glass. No charge. Nice touch.   Food: magnificent. I had the steak which was a little too well done for me but nothing to send it back for. However, my wife's scallop with spinach infused risotto dish had the softest scallops I've EVER TASTED. Honestly. The best.   Tip: unless you want a specific high end bottle, have wine by the glass as the wine list by the bootle does not work out cheaper. ~Mark T~London, United Kingdom
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Mamma Maria offers an upscale, gourmet Italian cuisine in an historic old home on North Square park.  It was undoubtedly one of the best Italian meals I have ever had.  Unlike many Italian restaurants, the fare here is prepared without being over-seasoned or drowning in heavy sauces.  The ingredients are fresh and highest quality and that shines through in every dish.  The menu changes regularly as well.  Not a typical Italian restaurant by any means--expensive but well worth it!~Brian T~Tampa, Florida
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a scale of one to 10 the food is a 9.5.  It was our second visit and the food was just as good as the first although very pricey.  Even the pasta entries start in the high 20's.  The staff was very attentive but very cold.  No one smiles and you feel as though they don't want to be there and you are bothering them.  The wine menu is also very pricey with on bottle in each category in the low 40's and a few in the 60's, then up.  I still give them a high rating based on how good the food is.~Hotpep~West Hartford, Connecticut
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came to Mamma Maria based on the high ranking on Trip Advisor but I must say that I was disappointed. Perhaps, my expectations were too high considering the high remarks as it was OK but certainly not worth the prices they were asking.   I had the Bolognese Pasta for $28 which I heard is one of their signature dishes but quite honestly, I thought it was average at best. I had better the evening before at half the price and the portion was 2x the size of Mamma Maria.   My wife had the lobster stuffed pasta which was very tasty but portion was small. She normally has at least half the meal to take home at a typical restaurant but had nothing left here.   We've been to several Italian restaurants in Boston and this had the best atmosphere but from a food perspective, it was good but did not live up to expectations. ~Gerry W~Tampa, Florida
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We could have eaten our way down the entire menu, but it's always polite to leave something for another visit. So we settled for baked oysters, carpaccio, crab and clam pasta and lobster agnoletti - all of which were beautifully cooked and presented. The extensive wine list and attentive service capped off a beautiful evening.  However, the dining room did get noisier as the night progressed.   And all this happened just 70 paces from Paul Revere's house. He would have loved it.~RBSheridan~Sydney, Australia
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed the meal, the food delicious, but the volume level was deafening.  I thought as the evening progressed and as larger parties left it would get better, but alas this restaurant is in an old house and the acoustics are terrible; sound bouncing off the walls.  As long as you're prepared for it, I would recommend this restaurant, but a dining experience is more than just the food.~CaliforniaFoodie~San Francisco Bay Area
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on the strength of the ratings and were disappointed.  Slow and pretentious service led to small food that was not tasty.  My wife few had a rabbit pasta which could have been mutton!  We will not return~Richard M~Fort Myers, Florida
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went there with a large family group on August 4th, 2016. Very authentic Italian cuisine. The food and service were both superb.~busyman269~Boston, Massachusetts
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went with friends, at their suggestion, and it lived up to expectations, which were very high.  We had a reservation, which is pretty much a necessity from what I can gather.  The table was ready early, and we were seated when we arrived about 15 minutes ahead of time. Service was impeccable throughout.  Drink orders were taken and delivered promptly, our server wanted to know if we had any questions, and waited until we were ready.  He was very helpful to those of us who were new to Mamma Maria's.  All of our dinners were delivered exactly as ordered, and properly served.  Nobody was rushed to finish, and they did not begin to clear any plates until everyone was finished -- unusual these days, but the right way to do things.  Appetizers of fried oysters, carpaccio,  and heirloom tomatoes were all fantastic.  For the entrees, the Osso Buco, pasta Bolognese, shrimp scampi and rabbit pasta were all exceptional.  We shared several desserts, the panna cotta, the apple tart, and the affogatto, all  of which were great.  This was one of the best restaurants I have been in. They offer valet parking, which is essential in the North End.~bbwex~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were taken to dinner here by a local who says he likes to bring guests to this restaurant because it is authentic Italian North End. good service, great wine and excellent food. Sat on the porch overlooking the square. wonderful evening.~jtraveller23~Chicago, Illinois
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While visiting Boston we had dinner at Mamma Maria and we really enjoyed it.  It is a charming restaurant with a menu that changes daily, with plenty of unique offerings. Because of this I won't even bother to describe what we ordered only to say it was all fresh and very well prepared.  The staff was warm, friendly and attentive.  We had an upstairs table by a large window with a lovely view of the North End neighborhood.  All in all a wonderful dining experience.~borninthebronx54~Greenville, South Carolina
Mamma Maria~322986~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wonderful in every way...We had everything from oysters, lobster risotto, incredible pastas, fabulous wine recommendation and service from Tom and the team. ~tzbreck~Breckenridge, Colorado, USA
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ah, we timed this perfectly.  Pulled up at the first metered space 10 feet from the door to Matt's Big Breakfast, stepped inside and sat down at the first table inside the door.  My friend and I both had the Belgian Waffle with bacon.  Thick, just crisp bacon was outstanding.  The Belgian Waffle was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  The server made me an iced coffee, which I really appreciated and it was great.  Service is friendly and quick here.  Not a beautiful restaurant, but I call it diner fun.  If you don't time it perfectly like me, you will be in a long line.  Get there just at 11:00 a.m.~Linda S~Phoenix, Arizona
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~At Matt's they keep it simple and they do it right every time.  There is a reason why there is a line out the door and a 45 minute wait every day.  The food is spectacular.~krwhite2016~Phoenix, Arizona
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Downtown Phoenix, in a fairly small restaurant and it's noisy. Small breakfast menu but the food was tasty and plentiful. The coffee was good. The bread was freshly baked with home made jam.  The bacon and ham were very tasty. Home fried potatoes were also very flavorful.  The portions were filling.  The staff were great.  Well worth a try.  The staff was great, attentive, and lots of thanks for coming in for a meal.~Brian B~Peoria, Arizona
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had to eat here twice it was so yummy.  Menu is limited to 15 or so breakfast items plus 2 specials per day.  What I realized after going with a large group of picky eaters is that everyone was happy!!! Ingredients are locally sourced, hearty and high quality. Wish I took pics of food. Best bacon and toast I have ever had.  Thick cuts good sized portions for reasonable prices.  Staff is friendly and very helpful.  Felt like I was a local and family.  ~wrightwayecon~Lincolnshire, Illinois
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast at this place. Everything about my experience was great. The employees welcome you with a smile and a greeting as soon as you walk in the door. Service was quick and my breakfast was amazing. Next time I return to town, I will surly be having another meal here. ~Carly K~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Matt's was recommended by a friend as a must while in downtown Phoenix. He was correct, we are looking forward to our next opportunity. The fare was fresh and top notch. Free range organic eggs. The best thick cut bacon. Fresh homemade tomatillo sauce. Beautiful fresh baked bread. Homemade berry preserves. Great smiling service. Wonderful coffee. Even stepped up quality napkins. All under the radar in the charming no frills diner atmosphere. Excellent!~John L~Prescott, Arizona
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Matts has the best breakfast in downtown Phoenix!!  There is always a bit of a wait, but definitely worth it!  Portion size is hearty and food is phenomenal.  The homemade hash browns and strawberry preserves are the best!  Servers are friendly and efficient, never need to ask for a refill on coffee.  Give Matt's a try...you won't be sorry!!~valpomom37~Ponte Vedra, FL
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~No need to pay for $20 eggs downtown at the Sheraton Grand Phoenix when I can walk four blocks north to Matt's BIG Breakfast this morning!~Kittylovesblue~Wimberley, Texas
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Oh how I wish they took reservations. Expect a wait but a hearty breakfast and speedy service once we got a table. ~Russellquack~Phoenix, Arizona
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great breakfast/lunch place. My favorite in downtown Phoenix by far. It is located in the hip Roosevelt section of Phoenix. There are a lot of cool cafe's and shops in this growing area. I have enjoyed the huge and tasty portions. Eggs, bacon, French Toast and Pancakes are all amazing. The staff is super friendly. I always feel welcome and remembered when I come in.~Warren N~Washington DC
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is place is the best! I had French toast and the slices were the largest I've EVER had! Oh yeah, it tasted heavenly. Great service + great food = get there!~Mattlisa~Seattle, Washington
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good food and plenty of it.  I especially like the coffee, homemade strawberry preserves & toast , and the table ketchup.  Had to wait for 20 minutes on a Sunday morning around 10:00.  That's not bad at all.  Multiple locations help visitors out when searching for a place to eat besides Cracker Barrel.~Roy G~Rancho Cucamonga, California
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Matt's Big Breakfast after seeing it on TV and it didn't disappoint! We tried the Chop & Chick and it was the perfect sized meal for two (with a side salad). The chop was well seasoned and the home fries were so good! The wheat bread was also excellent. We went in the afternoon so it wasn't too busy, but I hear that you need to get there early in the mornings on weekends to avoid a wait!~Alicia G~Vancouver, Canada
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for breakfast it was excellent.  The waffles are yummy and the bacon was great. Recommended highly.  A little wait but worth it. ~fungrandma25~Pocatello, ID
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great way to start your flight by fueling up on some hardy tasty grub!  Great Bloody Mary's and fantastic food make Matt's the place to go before you catch your flight.~KSSzymanski~Phoenix, Arizona
Matt's Big Breakfast~809958~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can tell this restaurant is going to be good the minute you walk in. It's a Tuesday morning and the place is already pretty full. The portions are big and the breakfast wasn't that bad. But the highlight of the meal was definitely the griddle cakes. If you're ever in the area you should stop by.~Sarah M~Cave Creek
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great restaurant in the "old steakhouse" tradition. Walls are covered with great photos. The food is better then "good 4/5 star" steakhouses. Fresh veggies in the wedge salad, the American Wagyu  top sirloin, were all above the top. Service impeccable, the wait staff was interesting and engaging. A top 5 in our book......~rbitv~Denver, Colorado
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had never visited this restaurant until now, I loved the atmosphere and the staff was so friendly and welcoming. I had the Delmonico NY Strip steak and boy was it delicious.~Colista F~Pocatello, Idaho
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I truly think these are the best steaks we've EVER had!  We started with a wedge salad. Split since portions are so large. Then had the filet mignon and the strip. Awesome flavor, cooked perfect!    We had a nice glass of wine with dinner. Nice wine list.   The service was impeccable. I will definitely be back next visit!~Lisa S~Erie, Pennsylvania, United States
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was able to enjoy a trip to the Met earlier this month with several co-workers.  I had never been previously but I will definitely be going back. It is absolutely the best dining experience I have ever had. Everything that we ate was top notch to say the least, and I have never had a steak literally melt in my mouth. I cannot recommend this place more. Also for dessert do yourself a favor and get the Hot Apple Pie. They also have private rooms available for large groups.~Eric H~Puyallup, Washington, United States
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I went here for dinner. The sign in the window says best steak in town. Good? Yes. Best? I don't think so. But by the price, they think it's the best. Most expensive place we ate all week. Good place if you like old stuffy steak clubs. Try the Brooklyn a block away. Great steaks priced more reasonably (if that's possible in Seattle).~HJD435~Johnson City, Tennessee
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice food, onion rings out of this world! Great sea food too. One off putting thing is the A.C. Blaring on your head all over the restaurant. Changes seats , they turned it off mo entarily then it came back on, ruined the enjoyment of the meal. Staff are lovely. ~Irene S~Basel, Switzerland
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped here after a conference to watch the World Series at their bar. We enjoyed tasty Happy Hour food and drinks. The staff was very friendly and attentive.~nycfoodie711~NYC
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of the greatest steak houses in the country. The atmosphere is fantastic, the food is superb and the staff is the best. We started with some local oysters and they were amazing. I had an excellent salad followed by a perfectly cooked bone-in filet. Nice char and juicy, tender meat. I had the brussel sprouts with bacon side and it was delicious. Their wine list is not to be missed, full of big red wines, domestic and imported. This is just a perfect place for a great night out that you will savor for weeks later~Brian W~Port Orchard, Washington
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Want a steak? Go the the Met.Great service. You can hear the voices of old Seattle in the room, right next to the Silicon-NorthVC'ers. You feel like you are in a living history museum restaurant - definitely a step back in time. Bring your wallet. Nuff said. ~oceanmoon4u~Arlington Heights, Illinois
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We go there for anniversaries and other special occasions.   The food and drinks are always top notch and the service is superb.  You won't mind paying the price for what you always get.~blackdawgswp~Olympia, Washington
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got lucky by getting in last minute for a party of 3 at 430pm on a Saturday.   Recommend making. reservation in advance for a meal here.  Inside is old, traditional style steak house.  Has a premium feel too it, but I also was thinking it could use a remodel.  If you have kids, kid meal value is awesome.  My son had a great steak and mashed potatoes and clam chowder for $12.00!.  My husband and I loved our food.   I will say they like to cook their food more rare, so if you like it more well done then you have to go well done as medium well was a little to red/pink for me...but still tasted great.  I got the bacon wrapped medallions listed as a special, which was amazing.  I love a filet typically and this was so tender with bacon.  Wedge salad was delicious and enough to share.  My husband got the pork chop.  Oh my, this was huge and very good.  The most important part....YOU MUST GET the Banana Foster.  They put a show at your table and it is easily enough for 4 people.  And Delicious!  We felt the service level and food was probably one of our best meals.  We were only visiting Seattle, but would come back for another meal during next visit. ~ALinCA5512~La Habra, California
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We inquired at our hotel where to go to have a good steak meal. More than one person recommended the Metropolitan Grill. I must admit it is expensive but worth it if you're looking for a good experience and expect top notch service and food.  Our waitress, Cat, was just as memorable as our steak and that is a big compliment! She hands down made our evening and even took photos of us an messaged them to me, as our phones were forgotten. She also provided us with complimentary appetizer and dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary. My husband likes rare beef and I like medium rare and her recommendation was spot-on to please both of us sharing a dish. Bottle of wine started at $45 but for anything decent was at least $65 -$600 I'm sure. The sommelier was also a delight and full of information to pick the right bottle to compliment our meal.   Worth the price tag for a memorable night and food that was exemplary!  Excellent, knowledgeable, helpful staff!!! Owner should be proud of this team.  ~100milecoles~Dawson Creek, Canada
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went here to celebrate the last night of our tour around the north west USA. This is a large and very busy steakhouse. We both had the same dishes, French onion soup to start which was well made and in the American style covered by a thick crust of cheese. For main course we had the 18oz prime rib with baked potato. The prime rib was very tender and full of flavour while the baked potato was also excellent.  Service was very attentive and at just the right pace, allowing a little time to digest the onion soup before the prime rib arrived.~Mike-Bucks~Caernarfon, United Kingdom
Metropolitan Grill~432615~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Metropolitan Grill as part of a group.   Several of us had food allergies and we called ahead to make sure that they could accommodate us.  My specific allergy is alcohol.  I asked the staff if the dessert had any alcohol and they assured me that it did not.  The dessert arrived and we started eating but there was liquor in the sauce.  I ended up with a severe reaction.   We talked to the manager but he didn't even refund part of the bill or offer apologies.~Demaris56~Poulsbo, WA
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing pastry.  Kinda crowded but worth the wait.  Apple turnovers and cannolis are amazing.  Littel pricey but worth it.~barnaclebobBoston~Boston
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best cannoli I have eaten, hands-down. Cash-only institution, so plan accordingly. It's a must-try in Boston.~Nathan G~Tucker, Georgia
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had fun checking out the fare  Cannolis were good not great. Other pastries were good.  Great service in a very busy busy place.  ~BarclayB3~Wheeling, Illinois
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I am a lifelong resident of Boston. Mike's has turned into a tourist trap. I can't believe the long lines I see. Out of towners tell everyone to go to Mike's. Locals know better. Go to Modern Pastry or even Bricco panateria (in the alley). Then you will get a fresh cannoli-Mike's freezes theirs and makes flavors that are not authentic cannoli fillings.~WorrywartBoston~Boston
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can always depend on the quality of pasteries when we stop by Mike's Pastry when we are in Boston.  It is easy to find ... on the main road that runs through the North End (Hanover Street) ... and always very busy.  Here is a tip for those who know in advance what they want to order -- call the take-out line and then you can skip the long wait in line to have an order filled by just picking them up.  Wish I had caught onto this tip a long time ago.~cwernig51~Falmouth, Maine
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really wanted to see what the cannoli hyp was all about, so I stood in line to buy the highly rated treat. I stood in line long enough to change my mind several times as to what flavour to get. I decided on a plain cream and at the last minute added a special of the day, Nutella. I had no idea these pastries were so big! When I got back to the hotel I took a bite of the plain cream (using my fingers, a fork was a waste of time), it was delicious! This one treat would have been more than enough for my husband and I to share. Of course I had try the Nutella cannoli in the box which I found a solid chocolate coating with a rich hazelnut filling. It was too much and very rich. I guess I would say, go there for the experience but only get 1 canolli and stick to the plain cream.~Bodiddles~Vancouver, BC
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Mike's in an old tradition for anyone living in the Boston area. It used to be the place to go! Now, d/t large crowds their products are now mediocre. ~Michelle M~Boston, Massachusetts
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Superb place for authentic cannolis. We went to the Harvard location which is quaint and right in the Harvard Square area. The Florentine is amazing--great crust. The Espresso flavored one was also excellent. ~Steven P~Opelika, Alabama, United States
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The crowds tell the story -- it's just busy all of the time.  The array of all the tasty, sinful, treats make it difficult to choose.  Get a variety.~spontaneousus~Denver
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has a constant lineup out the door and down the street... steady!  This place is a landmark in little Italy!   Great selection of cannoli flavours.....  amazing cannoli!!!  Well worth the wait!!!~Nadia A~Nobleton, Canada
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was really nice. Very busy and I could gain weight just standing there breathing. They have a heck of a choice of pastry.~rbell-57~Whitesville, Kentucky
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very yummy deserts. I have been there a couple of times and loved all the things I had. The only bad things is that there is a long line, so if you are in a hurry either omg early or skip it.. but I thi k this is a must if you are in the area.~Rosana O~Cape Coral, Florida
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Way too sweet. Heard that modern pastry and Mike's pastry were the best in Boston. I've eaten Cannoli in Sicily and Mike's are too sweet. My daughter called it when they had many flavors. She said there are two types ricotta and cream. I heard Mikes had a better shell.. not so much. Plus the staff was just rude. We were treated nicely at Moderns. Service should be number 1. I heard they don't have to be nice at Mike's because of publicity.. that is a downward spiral. ~michelle73837~Henrietta, New York
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped by to get a dessert after dinner at a local restaurant. It looked crowded but we actually waited less than a few minutes. We tried the ricotta pie/pastry. It was good. Hit the spot. Definitely worth trying once since you see everyone walking around with boxes. ~KelBelSmile~Allentown, Pennsylvania
Mike's Pastry~322997~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whether you visit MIke's in the North End or in Harvard Square you'll initially wonder at the lines for a bake goods shop.  Then when you dig into the pastries that are as big as your shoe and masterfully made you'll get it.  The "Lobster tail" is like a giant pastry filled with whipped cream that is to die for -- and will feed a family!  Yes, it's all fattening, but you need to try it -- do it on a good walking day of the city and you won't feel so guilty.~mbush1~Rochester, New York
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A recent business trip took me to Boston where I had the opportunity to enjoy some fine dining opportunities. I would rate Mistral as the best overall based on food, atmosphere and service. Our server was Edwin and he was professional, very pleasant and attentive yet not intrusive. His recommendations were spot on. The mushroom risotto appetizer was delicious and my favorite of the various selections we sampled. Everyone was equally impressed with their main courses and the duck I had was perfectly prepared. They had a broad selection of wines to fit every budget. To cap off the evening, we had a tasty selection of desserts which were all exquisite. It was an excellent evening and it is a great place to celebrate.~PS623~State College, Pennsylvania
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing service, amazing food, and hands down, the BEST bloody marry in Boston. Try it. You won't regret it. Have been multiple times for dinner and brunch. I'm in love with their brunch... It's truly a hidden gem in the city. Priced perfectly while getting the full mistral evening experience... What more could you ask for from one of the best restaurants in Boston?~M_Norstein~San Diego, California
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another recommendation from my Bostonian friends, brunch at Mistral is apparently a must on a Sunday.We arrived promptly and were greeted by a friendly lady.Bloody Mary's at the bar were very good.After being seated we were looked after by Brian the ONLY smiley waiter on the floor, the rest were totally miserable, even watching them serve other tables you could see this was the LAST place they wanted to be.The menu had a good brunch offerings both sweet and savoury.We ordered eggs benny and duck confit with vegetable hash,both were very good -the vegetable hash was huge and came with fried potatoes far too much for one person to eat as well as the three fried eggs on the top, it was piping hot, very tasty. Coffee was poor, far too hot and a very poor steamed milk - it was returned however the second the coffee was equally as bad, a second glass of fizz was safer! A nice restaurant offering good food, not much of a vibe and apart from the greeter at the door and Brian they need to take the rest of the staff to charm school. When I think of the cool places in NYC and London to have  brunch  this has a long way to go for atmosphere.~Victoria C~London, United Kingdom
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything we tried was delicious.  The beef tenderloin flatbread was to die for.  We also tried the special ravioli appetizer and that was perfect.  For meals we had the beef tenderloin and personally I like my meat not so rare and they cooked it perfectly for me - just the way I asked for it.  Portion size is also right - not over done! The atmosphere is upscale and not over the top.   Loved everything about it and can't believe it took us this long to get there!  Definitely will be back as Mistral is now on our "favorites" list!~Rhodymom2012~Arlington, Massachusetts
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food and atmosphere! The tenderloin,mashed potato pizza with white truffle oil may have been THE BEST thing I have EVER eaten. So amazing! Will definitely make a point to return when we are in Boston again! ~lacyg1~Noble, Oklahoma
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~From the moment we walked in we all felt the service from all that greeted up was fantastic.  Delicious food.  Great ideas for options.  Great ambience!  ~Pat S~Palos Verdes Estates, California, United States
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having never been to Boston before we were recommended by a friend to go to Mistral. Situated in a modern block and fortunately around the corner from the Lyric Theatre which we had just gone too it was a perfect end to see great evening. Mistral is Uber trendy, dimly lit, plenty of attentive staff and a imaginative menu. Crab pasta, pepper steak and homemade icecream. Boom. We both loved it and to nicely cap it off the Brazilian Gentleman looking after us very kindly sorted out the Mistral car to take us home to Harvard after a ding dong night. ~NGER14~London, United Kingdom
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having read the reviews and then visited  this restaurant, I had to check that we'd been to the same place. Descriptions previously used include 'elegant', small portions' and 'quiet'.  I should say that we are Europeans, so perhaps have different expectations of restaurants.    This is a very large, extremely noisy room, probably with 100 or more covers.  It was difficult to have a conversation across the table.  I had the crab ravioli, which was good and then the rack of lamb, which was very big.  The lamb had little flavour and the gratin dauphinoise had cheese (one of my pet hates).  The portion size I found to be off-putting.  The waiting staff were very pleasant.~Stanleyalb~Tours, France
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really like this place. from the ambience to the great food they've got. I like to seat at the bar to eat and people don't realize the bar menu is amazing along with the wine selection.~Nicholroar~Boston, Massachusetts
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I have had several wonderful dinners at Mistral.  The food is always exceptional as is the service and the atmosphere is just right.  The Seared Foie Gras with confit of duck in brioche with Wisconsin dried cherry gastrique and beef tenderloin, mashed potato and white truffle oil thin crust pizza alone are worth the trip.~SueMay28~Shrewsbury, Massachusetts
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is near the Friendly Toast so went here instead when there was an hour long wait at the Friendly Toast on the weekend.  There wasn't a line-up and we were able to be seated right away though it was very busy. It took a while to get our coffee but the starter apple crumble type pastry was very good. The poached eggs came out overdone but I did not complain at the time.  Then I noticed the folks next to us also got overdone poached eggs and sent them back.  We weren't asked how everything was until we were almost done, at which time I politely let the server know that it looks like all the poached eggs seem to be coming out of the kitchen overdone.  She apologized but then did not speak to me for the rest of the service.  She only looked at and directed her questions to my husband and even though it was my credit card that we were paying with, she returned the card to my husband and thanked him. I did not appreciate being ignored even though I was clearly trying to make eye contact with her.~binamistry~toronto
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had an excellent dinner and service the evening we had dinner at the Mistral.  We started with the tuna tartar and it may have been one of the best we had ever had.  Our server recommended the dover sole and said we could share and she was correct.  The fish was done to perfection served with a spinach and onion side and potatoes.  Some of the best sole I've had.  Very nice setting.  I did see some children at dinner who were very well behaved.~John C~Chicago
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We travel to Boston twice a year and we always try to score a reservation at Mistral because it's the most dependably wonderfully delicious place to dine in the city because we're foodies.  This past weekend was no exception.  Their foie gras appetizer is always my favorite, and it's large enough to share.  Both my husband and I had the halibut over risotto entree and without a doubt it was THE best, most delectable, perfectly prepared piece of fish we've ever eaten, and that's saying sometime.  We were too full for a "regular" dessert so we shared a scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream, which, not surprisingly, was scrumptious.~skylrk~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited on a Saturday night as we could not get into top of the hub our hotel booked us into this resturant. We were not disappointed the food was fantastic and I would strongly recommend a visit. Even though they we packed the service was excellent and we never felt unattended.~Keith M~Clacton-on-Sea, England, United Kingdom
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to this restaurant on a recent Saturday night and had high expectations.  My wife loved her meal but I didn't love mine.  I'll tell you why.  I first ordered the foie gras expecting something terrific.  Then I had trouble finding a main course on the menu because we wanted to have a meaty red wine but all I could find that interested me on the surprisingly plain menu were fish dishes.  Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.  So I went for a pork special.  It's as if on standard dishes the restaurant attempts to set them apart from the norm by adding some unusual ingredients, instead of starting with unusual dishes.  The fois gras appetizer was less foie than a big brioche filled with duck meat and overpowering somewhat salty sauce.  Difficult to eat.  And it was the $24 foie that I wanted.  There was a little slab of foie on top, however.  But I felt ripped off.  The excellent server had recommended a good Italian red and indeed, it was good.  I had it with the pork.  The relatively uninteresting pork, the quantity of which was massive, perhaps making up for the missing quality.    The markup on the wine was ludicrous.  Some bottles seemed to be 3 times more expensive than they should have been.  Perhaps it was to add a bit of loftiness to the place.  Our red was very good, though.  Dessert was OK.  Overall the place was packed but the ambience was good enough.  The service was very good and we liked our server.  I was just expecting a very special night, like those in other fine French restaurants.  Not at Mistral.  I would not go back.~Duke D~Boston
Mistral~321911~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were a party of 4, the ambiance is buseling & a little noisy at first, you soon get used to it, the waiters very helpful at explaining the menu, hard to choose such a verity of food, as I prefer fish, went on both entre and main, just fantastic. Lots of business people around us, the tables were turned so very busy~AnnieB717~Monte-Carlo, Monaco
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A last minute find!    The intended restaurant (Pastabilities) had a huge wait and the place was up to the Fire Marshall's limit of people inside.  And parking, like most cities with a university nearby, is difficult to acquire.   So, onto the review- I chose, the "three eggs any style" which included potatoes, three pieces of bacon with pancakes and two half slices of burnt toast (no jelly provided).    ***The food was just alright.  By that, I mean that my eggs were not hot and the pancakes were about 4in in diameter and extremely thin like crepes.  The maple syrup was very dilute.  I'm not sure of the brand of coffee, but it was terrible and cold once I added cream.  My 12 yo daughter had the hamburger with fries.  She was not happy with the burger and concentrated mostly on the fries. The restaurant is similar to a diner inside but it also has a bar near the entrance door. Very cold in the winter months.  There was no wait and the waitress was very attentive achieving a tip of 20%.   The bill was $60 for five people and the food should have been better; for example, when you serve pancakes that are small in diameter- they should be thicker and taste very good.   As a well-traveled, educated man from a southern state and being very hungry this evening; I was very disappointed that it was not better meal. I have lived in the north country for almost two years and have visited Syracuse on numerous occasions and have yet to find any restaurant that has truly satisfied my educated palate.  Should have gone to "The York", it appeared to be more my style. ~RibDoc~Alexandria, Virginia
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Admittedly these were some of the best blueberry pancakes that I have eaten.  Very fluffy flavorful.  They did not need any syrup at all.  They are served with whipped butter and some whipped cream.   That is all you need.~yoginor~Atlanta, Georgia
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a great lunch here. The atmosphere is great it reminds me of Johnny Rockets but the quality of food is much better. Tried the hot chocolate milkshake which was tasty. The staff was very friendly. The song "sexual healing" by Marvin Gaye came on during the meal which was funny. It would have been awkward maybe for a mother/son eating, lol. Would definitely go back. ~JeepMan185~Park City, Utah
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited Malt with my sister and niece on a Thursday evening. We were passing through Syracuse and needed a bite before heading back onto the road. The restaurant was fairly busy and seemed like a happy place for a quick meal.  The decor is sweet and a contemporary retro feel which is clearly exactly what they were going for. The Howard Johnson's colour scheme also helps to add that 50s feel to the place. The booth that we sat down at was a bit sticky despite having been wiped down and that tends to irk me but my sister gets truly annoyed. So we had to wipe the table down.    We were attended to by a young lady that evening. She was not rude or nasty but she was not particularly friendly, either. I can't put my finger on it but it was more that she was disinterested and short. She neglected to bring any utensils so when she quickly dropped the food down and disappeared, we had to wait for a reappearance in order to ask for silverware. When asked questions she would answer them but in a very quick, dismissive way. My sister asked about the soup of the day and then ordered a cup. The server brought the tiniest little thing you've ever seen , mumbled something and then walked away. We honestly couldn't believe how small it was. It was about 4 large spoonfuls! After being genuinely concerned that this was a cup of soup, we later figured out that it was a taster? And that may have been what the server had mumbled but for the life of us, we didn't understand her. Oddly, she also seemed unable to look at us when she spoke. Her attention always seemed to be elsewhere, head turned, eyes wandering. And I don't think she was scanning her tables, because later on when I *tried* to get her attention for the bill, she was nowhere to be found.   We managed to order our food and it seemed to take a while. I remember the food being okay. But not great. And that's the main problem. I could not, in fact, even remember what I had for dinner there until I just scanned the menu again to remind myself. It was the Lobster Benedict. I love Eggs Benedict. I *rememeber* Eggs Benedict if it is good. So let's face it, this was not up there with great food. But that's still okay. It's not a Michelin star rated restaurant.   Sadly, though, the service that we received coupled with basic at best food makes it hard to recommend this place. It's passable but I wouldn't go back too soon.~Jess M~Porthmadog, United Kingdom
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family and I went to Jersey Boys last night and wanted to have dinner first. We found this little gem just walking down the street. Love how the menu is a bit outside the box but also have the classics. The service and food were both very good. I've also never been  to a Malt shop that has a full bar.~Theresa P~Syracuse, New York
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a rainy Saturday morning, we had to wait 25 minutes for a table.  It was worth it.  The pork belly benedict was excellent, almost too much meat.  Solid spot for breakfast and you can get a Bloody Mary too.~hep734~Bernardsville, New Jersey
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The name is the first hint that this place has great shakes.  My wife had the thin mints shake while one son has the peanut butter shake.  They both loved them.   For dinner my wife and son has the Vermonter, huge French toast crusted with graham crackers and stuffed with lemon-maple cream cheese and blueberries.  Very rich but she loved it.  I had the ranch chicken sandwich with tater tots.  The sandwich was good but the tater tots were the best I ever had.  Very crispy.    The service was a little slow but it was. It coming from the kitchen.  It took 15 minutes just to get water. Chef Anthony D'Onofrio is very creative.  In fact, he changes the menu each season.  Good comfort food served in a creative way.  Bill for 4 including tip and three shakes was $84.  ~Norjeff2~West Orange, New Jersey
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The photos on Yelp don't even do it justice - tucked away around the corner from their sister bakery, this gem of a diner has simply thrilling generous portions and a charming decor that takes you back in time to the 1950s.  My daughter had the totchos and I had the cinnamon French toast, but it was a difficult choice among all of the incredible options on the menu. We were there on a Syracuse Football game day, so there was a 30 min wait for a table. We ended up opting to sit at the bar, and even so, the server was pleasant, efficient, and just great! Our food didn't take long, and it was so delicious I can't even explain.  Simply put, if you are in Syracuse - eat here!~sekelley~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a wonderful gem right in the Armory district. Their bake goods, toasts, breads etc are absolutely delicious... a must try!~Rene P~Buffalo, New York
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took my daughter for breakfast while dropping her off at SU.  It is decorated brightly in green and orange with bright tile and jars of candy everywhere.  Very fun and cute.  The menu is extensive so it was hard to decide what to order.  As I watched all of the food coming out of the kitchen, I was very impressed.  The portions were enormous.  The menu offered creative pairings.  For example, I enjoyed the blueberry/Bourbon jam on the biscuits.  I had a fresh fruit cup with tart apples, watermelon, orange and blueberries.  All was delicious.  I will definitely be back when in Syracuse.~TrackMomof3~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate at another downtown eatery and wanted to try the new bakery that from modern malt but it closes at 6pm. So we went to the modern malt and had desert there. My wife had a piece of pumpkin cheesecake and it was very good. My brother in law had a cookies and cream milk shake. He is in the ice cream business and makes a lot of shakes. He liked the shake and said they used really good ice cream to make it. My sister in law and I had a yellow cake with layers of apple and drizzled with caramel. It was ok but it needed some moisture. 3 had hot cocoa and it was really good. I had coffee and it was also very good. I will stop back for dinner. The waitress was real nice and was very pleasant. Her service was great too. ~chris13209~Syracuse, New York
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We can't say enough about this place as a family.  It has everything we want to eat and drink, and there's enough savory and sweet for all of us.~NYCityCountryMouse~New York City, New York
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We found this place on trip advisor and decided to try it.  Typical small eatery but with a twist.  We went for Saturday Brunch and it was well worth it!  The Bloody Mary's were great!  The Lobster Benedict and West Buena Omelet were incredible!  Fun atmosphere, good food and worth a visit!!~Jeanne L~Massapequa Park, New York
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for a birthday celebration. The menu was very interesting with many unique choices. Our waiter made it clear that the menu wasn't written in stone and they could alter just about any items we wanted to our specifications. We ordered a combination of breakfast and lunch items from creme brulee waffles to "hello buffalo" a chicken dish with fries and cheese curds. Both were dynamite! We also had their homemade shakes which were also delicious. Everything was tremendous! Can't wait to go back and try their fruity pebble french toast and breakfast piggy. The place has a 50's feel to it which makes it unique and fun. Will certainly be going back again.~Ferny11~Syracuse, New York
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went one night with a large group of 15 and they were able to accommodate us. The food was good and the snacks were great. The kids and the kids in us love eating here.~Eric T~Bridgeport, United States
Modern Malt~7694489~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a fun place to experience great food.  It was the kind of meal (and menu) that makes you want to go back the very next night.  We were a family of three and found so many items on the menu that looked fantastic, that we are eagerly planning our next trip there. We each had salads with added proteins and they were great- fresh, tasty, with bright adds (pickled ginger on one salad, kimchi on another.  We also had a buffalo wing inspired poutine to start and it was great too. Ambiance is 50's diner chic and was very comfortable. Service was attentive and engaged without hovering. As mentioned, we are headed back very soon!~Joe_Syracuse~Syracuse, New York
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A perfect way to end our day in Boston, dinner in the North End followed by a stop at Modern Pastry Shop for canoli!  Don't wait in the line and take it to go, take advantage of the table service, have a seat and enjoy your pastry right there (and then take one to go!).  The canoli is authentic and absolutely delicious - don't skip this stop when you go to Boston!~beverlya74~Concord, North Carolina
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a good Italian meal in the North End, decided to try Modern (as I was told it's where the locals go). Yes, it had a line out the door, but as you stood in line you had to pass by the treats in the case, so by the time it was your turn to order you could do so with confidence (I know another pastry shop across the street rushes you, and you can't see what to order until it's your turn). My party ordered different pastries to go, but everything was delicious. They also had little tables for sit down service as well. I will go back to try different treats!~BeachBum1234~CT
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always a hit!  Any time I come to Boston, always go to the North End for lunch and our favorite Cannolis to go!  There is always line, but well worth the wait.  Most times we get something to eat there with some great coffee.  If you aren't a Cannoli fan there is plenty of other baked good options!  I would suggest not coming here hungry or you will have a difficult to time deciding!  If you are a Cannoli fan - they fill them fresh while you wait - hence the line - but nothing better or fresher!  They now have different types of shells - chocolate dipped or covered.  I usually stick to the regular but sure the others are with a try.~Cindy O~Long Beach, California
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Even though this place has become extremely busy the quality of the baked goods is outstanding! Most go for the cannoli's but I love their Torrone. A must have for Christmas! ~Michelle M~Boston, Massachusetts
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved their cream puff. Stuffed with fresh whipped cream and sweetened ricotta. Perfectly crisp, flaky cream puff. So good. Huge, flaky croissants. Wonderful lemon square. Both tart and sweet. Crust was buttery and moist. Cannoli are stuffed to order.~AudreyS1994~Round Rock, Texas
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our friends recommended Modern.  I got the chocolate cake that was moist and delicious. My friends got Boston cream pie and a flaky pastry I can't  pronounce. Everything was wonderful. The young lady who helped us was very friendly asking were we were from, if we enjoyed our visit. She was really busy but so helpful.~Soilsister1244~Ocala, Florida
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So delicious!!! They have these Italian candy bars there that are a family recipe from Italy. I tried the Peanut Butter one, so so good! I also got a chocolate covered cheese cake. It was pretty good. Be prepared to wait in line, but the line goes quick!!~sniperaimee~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best pastry in Boston, new location (next door to old one) great ricotta pie and yes its worth the wait in line.~jdg00~Boston, Massachusetts
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There were so many to choose from - cookies, truffles, chocolate, baked goods, desserts, and more.  Good selection, helpful staff.  Located on Hanover Street in the historic area of the North End with various surrounding Italian restaurants.~Michelle R~Excelsior
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tremendous selection of delicious desserts. From Canoli's to fruit tarts to chocolate heaven. A must stop in the North End.~James V~West Palm Beach, Florida
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walking the north end area and was told by friends from Boston that modern was the best. Wife and I stopped and could not agree more. Good coffee and pastry that was freshly made. Cash only no credit cards but do not let that stop you ~MIFire~Eagle River, Wisconsin
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We did a taste test on both the cannoli and the black and white cookies ,comparing Modern to Mikes. NOt even close, Modern was by far the superior in taste on both items. THe cannolis are made to order, not too sweet and the shell is always crisp. MIkes has the more upscale look but the pastrys are far better at Modern~J F~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were advised to try modem pastry when waiting in line to eat lunch.  We had lunch and walked to pasty shop. They have lunch also but we just got dessert to go. Lots of choices. I enjoyed my key line tart . SO GOOD!! ~Angela B~Texas
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When inBoston you must try a Cannoli from Mikes pastry and a modern and then pick which one you are... they are omg good. modern was also a nicer atmosphere the girl at the counter talked with me for a bit and was sooo present Mikes just took your order and gave your stuff and went to the next person.~Dieseldog2014~Calgary, Canada
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You choose the type of shell, the filling and the topping. They create a cannoli that is beautiful to watch and tastes very satisfying. The ricotta filling could be a little less sweet for my taste but it was still delicious!~Mina50952~New York City, New York
Modern Pastry Shop~523539~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~so much to choose from. Cappuccinos were perfect. If it's too crowded, there is an express store right next door with all the same offerings (except porcelain mugs, it's a to-go place with seats)~trvvlngkim~Trumbull, Connecticut
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Absolutely delicious cupcakes! It was hard deciding which one to choose but I went with the Boston Cream Cupcake and it was just amazing. I will for sure be back next time I'm in NY. ~Jette S~Odense, Denmark
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a great dinner or lunch, here's the spot for dessert!!! If you can't find it here, you don't need it!~Professorjl~Jersey City, New Jersey
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cute little bakery with swings at the counter! SWINGS! Order yourself a cupcake and have a seat on a swing. The cupcakes are delicious. Didn't realize all the ones I ordered were filled though, which became a little much after a while. The ladies behind the counter were very helpful. ~Andrea A~Orlando, Florida
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Definitely worth the cab ride over to Molly's.  Some of the best cupcakes ever!  And you can walk over for dessert after having a slice of pizza at Joe's.~SoonerDallas~Dallas
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love cupcakes and Molly's  have been the best in the city I have found.  I have tried them all and other than anything chocolate the strawberry shortcake is a must have.  The filled and unfilled all terrific.~KimberlyMKA~Johnson City, New York
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the atmosphere! The cupcake was the best cupcake I have ever had. The store is clean and in a great location. Great prices and variety!~rhoadesteach~Hillsboro, Ohio
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I thought the cupcakes were very good, but not overwhelming.  There was a variety of unusual flavors, I really enjoyed the cookie dough center cupcake.  They were very moist and lots of frosting.  I think that is the only reason why they come close to being worth the $3.75 per cupcake cost being charged.  I would expect that the cupcake be out of this world for that price.~Cruisingonvacation~Westlake, OH
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really cute desert place. When you walk in its sure to impress. The eye stealing point is the swings that you can sit on while eating at the bar.  Plenty of cupcake selections, the salted caramel and peaches and cream were my guilty pleasures.   The staff were just ok. The girl at the till hardly cracked a smile and seemed annoyed when we asked for the wifi info.   Despite this I would still go back for the cupcakes!! ~dionb91~Shellharbour, Australia
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So many good options. I had the chocolate covered Oreo. It was colder than I thought it would be, but still very delicious.   They have fun swings to sit on at the bar. Complementary water and sprinkles to put on your cupcakes.   The Decor is fun. Lots of vintage items around the place.   I noticed that there is free Wi-Fi there.   Tip: if you go there to hang out and use the Wi-Fi, Bring your charger. They have power outlets by all the tables. ~victor g~Kansas City, Missouri
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So much fun going there, especially with friends from across the ocean that never tried such cupcakes before. They loved them and I did too.~Blerina D~New York
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The cupcakes are so good! I had a vanilla with chocolate frosting and a blueberry streusel cupcake! They serve my favorite coffee-Intelligentsia (Molly's blend). Very cute atmosphere in one of my favorite NY neighborhoods. The staff was so friendly and helpful. ~Courtney H~Chicago, Illinois
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They are good cupcakes but it's cupcakes. They are moist with decent choices of toppings and they put lots of it. I sure hope so since it's $2.50 per cupcake if you take the Molly size (reg size). I make cupcakes just as good. The decor is very cute. ~Pierre C~Beaconsfield, Canada
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We actually went back a second time while in New York for 3 days..Cupcakes were the best I've had! Loved the swing seats!!~lcampbell7~Roscoe, Illinois
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We found Molly's via the near me now feature on trip advisor , wanted a sweet ending to a nice lunch. Place is cute and the tables are old school desks , it did seem more like a kids place then a bakery tho. Next time I will build my own cupcake as that is on the menu !! Got a dozen to to all filled and they were good, worth a trip if you are in the area. They also won best cupcake on cupcake wars !!!~MS_DREAMVAKAY~New York City, New York
Molly's Cupcakes~2321555~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here as part of our Cupcake tour and this was our favorite spot! First of all, the decor is very welcoming and friendly. They have swing chairs ( like at the playground) but they cant go anywhere. Still, its a very cute idea and we liked the option of sitting in them to eat!   Our tour had us do the pick your own cupcake ( Molly size) and I got the red velvet with the brown butter frosting ( which was amazing )! The regular frosting (I think it is the french frosting?) is a lighter, less thick frosting, which my daughter didnt really like but she liked the cake.  They have Dukes of Hazard memoribilia on the walls and it is just a very cute place to stop in. The only thing I thought they could improve on is that they have a water cooler but it was full of lukewarm water. I thought they should have had someone fill it to make it cooler with Ice (it was over 100 degrees out the day we visited! ) Otherwise,  I would highly recommend!~VernonCT~Vernon, Connecticut
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always appreciate a Japanese restaurant as they can usually accommodate my low sodium dietary regimen with fresh sashimi! This destination close to Independence Hall and other historic attractions is worth a visit...as the ambiance is relaxing, the food elegantly presented and satisfying to the palate. Staff is willing to make substitutions to meet diet requirements and this is always a plus for each of our party had different needs.~Lois C~Bethesda, Maryland
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~An uncommonly special dining experience with a unique menu and variety of Asian food choices.  Special thanks to my business friends from Jacksonville, dedicated "foodies" who hosted dinner.  The sushi was the best I've had and the main courses were simply phenomenal (we shared bites during the experience).  The rock shrimp tempura was out of this world.  The Surf and Turf (wagyu beef and salmon) and the Duck-Duck-Duck (madras duck breast, duck confit fried rice, duck egg and Mandarin oolong reduction) were delicious.  I've never had a drink like their Ota, which was Grey Goose, pear, yuzu and mint.  Our server was absolutely top rate.  At one point, a long plate of sushi was also provided as a surprise gift to us, compliments of the house.~Slappy1985~Sanford, Florida
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another Steven Starr restaurant this is in partnership with the Iron Chef himself. Attractive color changing interior~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Brought my sushi loving son.  He said it was the best he's ever had.   The fish had been overnighted from Japan.  Very cool atmosphere. ~Shani M~South Burlington, Vermont
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fresh and delicious sushi. Intimate atmosphere. Expert service. Surf and turf was a delight. G joy Sake perfect accompaniment. ~mhdaisy~Carmel, Indiana
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great dinners out don't come cheap, but they're worth it. Everything about Morimoto is top notch. The food is fresh, interesting and delicious. One of us at the table had the 8 course chef menu. For $100 (I told you it was expensive), eight delicious courses of sushi, ceviche, even a meat dish, plus a custardy dessert. One of us had a bimibop bowl. The bowl itself was heated to 400 degrees, and the thin slices of steak were put up against the bowl at tableside to be cooked. We even had a cocktail that was constructed at tableside. The waitress was incredibly well versed on the menu, and the service was excellent. The place itself is pretty, with changing colored lights inside the lucite furniture. Now I know why this place is packed, even on a Thursday night.~arl8058~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can't say enough about the food and service in this place!! It is the most fresh and delicious food I have had in I can't remember when. The noodles are made fresh and are delicious!! The sushi was incredible. The sea bass was delicious ! It's pricey but worth it!! I'd definitely go back!~jbrewandcrew~Iuka, Mississippi
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I recently visited Morimoto in downtown Philadelphia for the first time. Our waiter, Makoto, was super kind and informative as it was our first time there. It's so cool as the tables, chairs, walls constantly change colors in soft  hues throughout the evening. We ordered the tuna pizza which was spectacular, along with the Wego dumplings, to die for, followed by the lobster ceviche and then the duck!  It was outstanding and I definitely will be going back there. On a sidenote I hostesses were also extremely kind and informative and greeted us with warm smiles. I'm glad to share this experience with all of you as it is definitely a place for great sushi too! ~Beyonce1230~Boca Raton, Florida
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited the restaurant with 5 friends for a late night dinner. We did not have a reservation so the front desk recommended we sit at the upstairs bar/lounge instead. This was perfect! We were able to order from the full menu & the bar/lounge had small chairs and tables so felt very intimate! Our favorite cocktail was the Karai (very fresh tasting). We shared several items. Our favorites were: rock shrimp tempura, wagyu dumplings, ishi yaki bop with wagyu (be sure to get this!), and black cod miso. We did not enjoy the tuna pizza. The service was excellent & the atmosphere was very unique and special for my friends and I to experience together. I would recommend this place!~alfer05~Fort Worth, Texas
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Months before arriving to Philadelphia I made reservations for us and a group of friends at Morimoto. I was told that I was going to be impressed and they were right.  You must make reservations ahead, I did like 60 days prior because spaces for groups of 8 and up are very difficult to get. We were absolutely well taken care of by Justin. As a big group we ordered of course sushi that was to die for, wagu beef so delicious and the presentation is just pure art. This is a great restaurant and the prices are on the high side but it so worth every penny. Absolutely recommended!~AMBB~PR
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They say that eating is a multi-sensory experience and Morimoto is a testament to that fact.  The atmosphere was very relaxing with the every changing colors of the restaurant furniture.  The drink specialties were very unique and my drink had pear, yuzu and mint in it.  The combination was delicious.  I ordered the surf and turf and it was quite possibly one of the best things that I have ever eaten.  My husbands dish was good (it was a seafood stew type of dish) but if you love surf and turf their version is a must try.  Oh, and of course the sushi was first class!~Keflewis~Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good sushi and sashimi. Sushi pizza sounded better than it was, but chefs sashimi appetizer more than made up for it. Fish was fresh and delicious. Server was knowledgeable~510mark510~Baltimore, Maryland
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We can see why Chef Morimoto is an Ironman Chef! The food was superb! Everything we ate was beautiful and delicious. We were there for a business dinner but they all stopped talking business to taste every delectable bite. Everyone of the six of us enjoyed our meal and would go back again in a heartbeat! ~Linda R~Cottonwood Heights, Utah, United States
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We loved everything about the restaurant - from the relaxing vibe, warm ambiance and fantastic service to the truly delicious food....it was an awesome culinary experience involving all of our senses!~Jennifer R~Canada
Morimoto~433450~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here with a very large work group.  The whole restaurant is some type of theme, fish, waves, not sure.  Interesting.  I think this sets you up for what you are going to receive.   We all went for the 8 course, chefs choice, the modern version.  This is a lot of food, and all of it was fantastic.  Presentation was really well done, sushi and fish was extremely good.   Overall a great experience.  Something everyone should try.  The waiter was really over the top.  Announced the food like you were winning a prize.  Engaged the whole table and went out of his way to make sure we all enjoyed the food.~Barry H~ottawa canada
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Awesome breakfast. I had the omelette special with chicken sausage and onions. Delicious!!!! Great portions. I was full and had some left over. Good wait staff. Fast service. Worth a trip!~Nicole  J~Sandy Spring
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious home fare set in an atmosphere to warm the cockles of any mothers heart, they even had my late mothers comfort food on the menu....which of course I ordered given it was going to be a farewell to my gal at the end of brunch as she was headed on her travels and I was headed back to nz. Awesome venue, great shirts and heart warmingly delicious food, oh and possibly the best Bloody Mary ever~Sandy H~Auckland Region, New Zealand
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First night in PDX and stumbled across Mother's Bistro while walking the neighborhood near my hotel.  Glad I decided to venture inside.  Really does have the vibe of a comfortable family dining room, although the bar side is a little more "adult".  Loved my Moscow Mule - and at $8, quite a bargain!  Small Caesar salad to start had just the right amount of tang in the dressing.  Entree of 1/2 portion of short rib pot roast was just the right amount of awesome.  The smashed potatoes were the best ever - except mine - so that's something!  The meat was tender, perfectly seasoned and satisfying.  The complimentary cookies were the perfect end to a perfect meal.  Solo dining can be a pain, so Mother's Bistro gets one extra star for making me feel welcome, valued and not so alone!~DandLtravel~Burbank, California
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Mother's is a hopping, very busy breakfast bistro.  Be prepared to wait a little bit for a table, but the wait is worth it.  Considering how busy the restaurant was, the service was excellent.  I can't remember enjoying a breakfast restaurant so much.  I had the Pork Apple Sausage and Cheddar Cheese Scramble which was fantastic.  My wife and I also shared fresh pressed Ethiopian coffee.  Well worth it.~haill33~Reno, Nevada
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in by chance when we were in Portland. Busy place, Had the Mikes Special Scramble, was great lots of whole garlic cloves and prosciutto ham. Crunchy French toast is different and very tasty. Service was great, only thing we didn't like was Mothers blend coffee was a little on the weak side and not very hot.~rickjurewicz~Franklin, Wisconsin
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great restaurant that offers amazing selection of food that is suitable for all and taste for every one.~Hossien E~Corvallis, Oregon
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is always busy. It ios great lunch and early dinner destination, Dependable comfort food is guaranteed. It is a fun location for family. I was introduced to my future son-in-law there 13 years ago.~415koconnell~Portland, Oregon
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We loved the food and the decor of this cute bistro.  Fun atmosphere and delicious, filling food!  Service was prompt and friendly and I really wish we could have visited a few more times before we left Portland.~PopcornGirl~Louisiana
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for breakfast on the recommendation of the greeter at our hotel.  We enjoyed it so much that we went back later in the afternoon for lunch.~ens43~Campbell River, Canada
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on the weekend so we had to wait an hour, but it was worth it. Crunch French toast is my new favorite breakfast food. There is much more I want to try from their menu. The chai wasn't very flavorful though, so give that a pass.~Atalanta8~San Jose, California
Mother's Bistro & Bar~487868~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Working in downtown Portland we needed a quick bite between meetings.  After a short walk we settled on Mother's Bistro.  This restaurant in a remodeled older building has all the charm that you would expect of something named after your Mother.  Our group ordered both breakfast and lunch and was well satisfied.    The price was very reasonable and the service quick and friendly.  We will return if the opportunity arises!~oregonwanderers2016~Canyon City, Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A cozy restaurant with very genuine and tasty Italian fare. The selections on the menu do not seem to change often but what they serve are excellent. All the appetizers and entries we have tried are tasty and authentic. The wines are mainly from Italy especially those by the glass but whole bottles from other countries are available. Deserts are not to be missed. Service is friendly and efficient. You will not be disappointed by dining here.~Adtravel75~Corvallis Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing wine list, wonderful bread.  Incredible service! White table cloth - great spot for people watching in downtown Portland.  Strongly recommend!  Made reservation through OpenTable~45MariaL~Liberty Lake, Washington
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Finding really good Italian restaurants in Portland is not easy. Mucca Osteria is one of two exceptions to that.  My wife and I visited not knowing what to expect. Although it has high ratings, no one we knew had been there.  The food, preparation, and service were all top notch. It was a bit pricey, but not outrageous.  We will definitely be back!~Mark F~Washougal, Washington
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely meal!  Mushroom tortellini, penne pasta, tagliatelle pasta, caprese salad.  Excellent service, great presentation, extensive Italian wine list.~EKingTucson~Tucson
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best pastas I have ever had. Would expect to find this gem of restaurant in Northern Italy. Can't wait to return. ~RisaPulver~New York City, New York
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant serves wild game so I had a hard time picking something out to suit my taste. I had tortellini, which was a pasta cup filled with mushrooms and asparagus. It was good. The Belgian chocolate dessert was the highlight. Great atmosphere even though the waitstaff is snooty and the menu is written in a fancy way (give me the pasta and mushrooms won't you). Make sure you have reservations. Plan on about $50 pp.~BigDDetroit_MI~Detroit, MI
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was very good!  The food was good. My partner ordered a salad and the greens seemed soggy . I ordered the veal which came with greens , they were also soggy. I had the pasta with the pheasant, the pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce flavor was good. My partner had the gnocchi they were soft and almost melted in your mouth.  Our server was very nice, attentive and had excellent suggestions. Oh the panna cotta was good.~Jeos71~San Francisco
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have a truly extensive Italian wine list that stretches pages and pages.  The most amazing part is that the waiter knew the wines on the list intimately.  He described in very great detail suggested wines for our particular meals.  Wow!  The pasta is really fresh and good.  Mains were pasta with pheasant and mushrooms, the second was pasta with shrimp.  Both were really yummy.  The service was very good.~FuzzyBeaver~Montreal, Canada
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This intimate Italian restaurant serves up exquisite delicious fare featuring fresh and usually organic ingredients.  Our venison dishes (ravioli, filet) were perfectly prepared and wonderfully presented.  The special caprese antipasto was a yummy tower of tomato and burrata.  Our very Italian waiter patiently repeated himself until we tuned into his accent; he was efficient and knowledgeable about the food, preparation, and the wines.  Though Mucca faces a light rail line, the restaurant was packed on a weekday night both inside and out.  It deserves every kudo it receives.  Make those reservations asap. ~DS1Arlington~Arlington
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a wow!  Ambiance lovely, small and quaint. Upstairs seating. We had the best table in the house overlooking the city street. Fantastic service with lots of help. My tortellini was absolutely delicious. Dessert list was extensive. I had  Semifreddo all'Amaretto and it was divine. Very expensive overall and the wines were over priced for what you got. Bring your own bottle and pay the corkage fee. You will save money.   Our only complaint was the salad selection. There was only one to choose from. A beet salad with about 3 arugula leaves on it. A complete rip off for $12! They should offer at least 2 salads and make one affordable! It did have a wonderful taste though..... ~BarefootBuddies~Portland, Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~True taste of Italy. All the wait staff is Italian especially the chefs. Atmosphere is romantic but on the small side.~Hattie S~Portland, Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Upon arrival, we were seated promptly and found atmosphere with a welcoming casual sophistication. Our waiter was terrific and made us feel we were back in Italy. Appetizer of scallops were delicious. My entree special of squid-ink black pasta ravioli was filled with halibut with a buttery wine sauce with olives, greens and tomatoes. Yum! The light sauce with ravioli was perfect. Husband had the halibut, needed a sauce to finish, yet was beautiful presentation. The pannacotta spot on, and one of my favorites. Authentic Italian cuisine. Enjoyed and would go back.~Michelle F~West Linn, Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good food, and a reasonably priced wine list. We had very nice weather so took a table outside. The service slipped in terms of bringing the wine in a timely manner, but they acknowledged that fact without us having to say anything. ~mstickler~Lake Oswego, OR
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited Mucca based on previous Trip Advisor reviews. Sat at the "chef's table" which was like a bar. Would like more interaction from chefs but sat next to some very friendly people. Burrata prosciutto salad was outstanding - so fresh!  Carbonara portion looked small until I tasted the handmade thicker noodles. Excellent. Would like more than just Italian wine for choices but half bottle worked out ok. Good bread - olive oil very fruity for my taste. Great dinner after a miserable rainy day. Make reservations - small, very busy place. Attentive service. ~Donna H~Phoenix, Arizona
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We did not have a reservation but they kindly seated us and we were so glad they did. Their pasta was delicious, we shared a lovely salad, a spinach pheasant ragu tagiatelle and a delicious gnocchi. The wine selection was teriffic and delightful service.  A must try for real Italian food in Portland.~Caroforbes5~Vancouver
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We dined at Mucca Osteria on a Wednesday night. We were able to make a reservation which I appreciate as many restaurants in Portland do not take reservations. The restaurant has a nice ambience, and the food was excellent! We had the scallops and tuna dishes for starters, and the pasta with mushroom and asparagus, and the special with shrimp and spaghetti. All the dishes were amazing and beautifully cooked. What a treat - and as it was our anniversary we shared 2 desserts - the tiramisu and the port chocolate cake. Both were decadent and the perfect finish to a wonderful meal. The staff were attentive, but as things moved into more of the busier dinner time we saw less and less of our server. It seemed like he had all the tables on the lower floor and the outside tables as well. All in all - wonderful food and a nice experience! ~kmac1322~Portland, Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner in the Mucca Osteria because it was so highly rated in TripAdvisor reviews.  We did NOT agree.  It is a very expensive, small, crowded and noisy restaurant.  A minimal meal for two with a half bottle of Chianti cost over $100.00!  The half bottle of Chianti was $30 itself...which felt like robbery for a quite mediocre wine!  I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone...SORRY!!!~Dale H~Tillamook, Oregon
Mucca Osteria~2359958~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were looking for a place to have dinner an Portland and are happy we chose this restaurant.  The service was friendly and the food was great and different.  For example, the special I had was squid-ink pasta black ravioli filled with halibut and vegetables served with a buttery wine sauce with olives and tomatoes.  The scallop appetizer was terrific also: browned on the outside and creamy in the center.  My wife's risotto was quite plain, with pecorino and pepper, but delicious as was her prosciutto and burrata appetizer.  Definitely beyond the usual Italian restaurant.  The tab, with a glass of wine each but no desert, was $108.  At 9 p.m. on Friday night, the place was crowded while the surrounding restaurants were winding down.~Stephen K~Berkeley, California
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Being the oldest restaurant in Hollywood and with its history of the stars coming here I had to make a visit. Good service and nice location but I was surprised about the food, something you could get at a nearby diner for half the price.~PeterThomas1980~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Built in 1919 Hollywood's greats dined here. Impeccable service, wonderful food and a fantastic environment you can imagine Charlie Chaplin at a table next to you.~AndreaMichaels1214~Los Angeles, California
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cool to go where Hemingway, Hammett, F. Scott Fitzgerald hung out with the Classic Hollywood stars.  You've got to try the Fettuccine Alfredo - it's great!~Deena T~Cleveland
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Going off the reviews I was expecting great things. However, I found it overpriced and overrated.  The food was ok, but nothing special. The building itself was cool though. To sum up it was ok but I would not return.~lisashaw27~Los Angeles, California
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great old restaurant atmosphere! A contrast to the somewhat dirty streets in Hollywood. Waiters were fabulous, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and accommodated special requests. ~Coralee G~Billings, MT
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I first ate at Musso and Frank in the late 1950s (!!!), most recently circa 1976.  I can truthfully say that almost nothing has changed in the decades except that the traffic getting there is worse, and the menu prices are higher.  I am generally not a great fan of large portion calorie dense high salt foods.  Nevertheless, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the ambience and the food.  I will certainly return in the reasonable future.  This will have a high place on my list of places to show to first time visitors to Los Angeles. ~hale_ron~Beverly Hills, California
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited Musso & Frank with a group - we had a block of tables set aside for us and we had a set menu with just a few choices that included steak, salmon or a vegetarian pasta. So, it wasn't the typical experience with the full menu, etc., but overall I was not impressed. My first impression was set the moment I walked in with the musty smell of the place, like my 1915 basement used to be before I fixed the leaky foundation. After a while, I didn't notice it but of course it was still there.   The food was mediocre. My vegetarian pasta was gummy and a few of may table mates sent their steak back to be cooked up to medium-rare! Nobody complained about the salmon, but there was no praise either. The New York cheesecake, however, was delicious - not too sweet with the perfect texture. So there's that! The service was pretty good, but we had a dedicated set of waiters and bussers due to the size of our group. I looked through the wine list, and it looked pretty good with reasonable selection at many price points.  Overall, meh. The smell, the dark and crowded room, the food... it did not add up to a good time. I know this place has history and that's worth something, but I left feeling that is all they have to offer these days.~jameskul~Toronto, Canada
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Musso & Frank's has been serving up classic fare in their classic Hollywood establishment since 1919. You will feel like Bogie and Bacall and Bette Davis are about to stroll in for their usual tables as you enjoy delicious offerings from the grill. A must experience for those who love atmosphere and good comfort food.~Matthew S~New York
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really enjoyed the Grill.  Great history and great service and great food.  Filet was awesome and the wine by the grapes wells excellent.  Really great quality. ~Kevin I~Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sure, you've heard it's the longest running restaurant in Hollywood and part of you thinks, is it just a tourist trap? We are happy to say, please try this place. To start, great waiter and it seemed as though everyone who worked there, was pleasant and efficient. I really enjoy a cold martini that is done right and theirs was. Small glass and they bring the remainder in a split that is kept cold in a tiny bucket. The sourdough bread reminds me of the sourdough you get in SF and it was very good. I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Like Tadich Grill in SF and Galatoires in NO, Musso and Frank does not disappoint.~bigredsetter~Overland Park, KS
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The oldest restaurant in Hollywood. Great atmosphere, good service and the best steak we have had. Generous portions as well.~Brede L~Os Municipality, Norway
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This fine dining restaurant is located on the Hollywood walk of fame.Its has been A family run restaurant since the 1930's.The staff is very friendly.The food is Amazing! Very affordable prices.Musso & Franks Grill is one of our favorite places to eat while vacationing in Hollywood California.Don't be surprised if you see celebrities while dining there.The on ambience takes you back to a much earlier time.A must thing to do while visiting Hollywood.Parking in the rear.~William K~Charleston, South Carolina
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a gem in Hollywood it's like an old steak house from the 20s. The service is great the food is fantastic and the deserts are great. If your in Hollywood and want a bit of luxury then this place is a must. ~Duskman554~Eastbourne, United Kingdom
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walking the Hollywood Strip and decided to stop here for a steak.  There was about a 35 minute wait and the place was bustling.  We were seated in a nostalgic oak booth by the host.  The menu is pricey with steaks in the $40 plus area.  The service was impeccable with the Italian sounding waiter checking back several times. The steaks were great and you could almost cut the rib eye with a fork.  Everything is Ala Carte, but the orders are large enough to share.  You always have the possibility of seeing a celebrity here, as we did.  Great food, if you don't mind paying a bit more than usual.~Rottman~Vegas
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While strolling the Hollywood Walk of Fame, my wife and I were on the lookout for a nice place to relax and have lunch. When we walked past the Musso & Frank Grill, I checked out the menu while my wife looked the place up on the internet. Their website billed the place as the oldest continuously operated restaurant in Hollywood. With that pedigree in mind we gave it a try. The ambience was both historical and classic. The menu was full of delicious sounding food but what caught our eye was the "seafood omelette". We both ordered it and were very pleased. Musso & Frank Grill is a very nice place and a great escape from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood.~wmloyd4855~Pleasant View, Tennessee
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Who said LA has no culinary history?  If you are a fan of film noir, barflies drinking gin & tonic or martinis, get thee too Musso & Frank.   First off, there is valet parking in the back.   Very cheap for the first 3 hours and after that it jumps to $15.   Just keep track of your drinks.  Do not park on the street at night.   Hollywood is known as Hollyweird for a reason.   I made reservations which are recommended and was seated immediately.  The hosts were friendly which was a breath of fresh air, especially in LA where the hippest restaurants should rethink their hiring of front staff.  I prefer kitschy to _itchy.   The wine pours were generous from a good list.  The caesar's salad was exactly as I wanted and the ribeye was cooked to perfection.   Please get the green peppercorn sauce to pour over it!   Ah, ambience was the best!   Dark but not dank wood walls, dimmed lighting and a definite bucket-list joint.~Kcarma~Los Angeles, California
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You won't want to miss this restaurant if your in Hollywood. Dates back to 1917 and was a favorite among movie stars. Charlie Chaplin, Bogie and Bacall and many others. Steaks are perfectly prepared. Make sure you ask for the brief history of the restaurant.~Steve M~Inverness, Illinois
Musso & Frank Grill~514194~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~read the history of the place whilst waiting for your food, great service and great food.  Would definitely return - booking recommended.~evelyninhouston~Houston
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came for lunch based on a recommendation from the Rosemont BandB. Great atmosphere, indoor and outdoor dining, locals which is what we love and reasonable prices about $10 a meal. Food was alittle more upscale than your typical pub food but all good. Pouting fries were amazing, get the pork added with it, it's worth worth it. Great place right by the saranac brewery!~treandtaj~Rochester, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Chicken and greens sandwich was one of the best sandwiches we ever had.  Natalie behind the bar was awesome,  she even gave us an umbrella as we left!~Nancy B~Conesus, New York, United States
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have dined here for lunch many times with family. My 90 year old dad loves the soup. Nice lunch menu, you'll find something you like. Great brew menu, staff is as friendly as they get, and will definitely "know you name". Cheers!~SpyderP45~Marcy, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like to stop at the nail creek for a beer on occasion. They have a nice selection of craft beers from everywhere. Pub atmosphere, outdoor deck. Food is good, basically pub fare, but I liked the cheese plate and a salad. Fries looked good, but I didn't try them.~mrs b~Utica, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went for brunch on Sunday with friends and my daughter.  Once we were seated, we waited about 15 minutes for server to come to the table.  When she did (Nicole) the very first thing she said was "we are out of salmon benedict and the rancheros, and its gona be over an hour wait for food." My friends and I were fine with waiting for food, however I knew my daughter was hungry so asked if there was anything we could order for her-toast, French fries, while we waited.  Along with the eye roll, we were told No. We were going to leave, however knowing that the brunch is delicious, we decided to wait.  Nicole never returned to our table, even though she walked past at least 4 more times.  My friend decided to just go up to the bar to order our drinks.  Nicole at this time returned and asked to take a "drink order then".  When I stated friend was at the bar, her response was so rude and unprofessional-eye rolling,and her tone of voice was that of a child.  She just walked away.  While we enjoyed our Bloody Marys (although bar said they were out of the appetizer style), we noticed Nicole waiting on another table pointing to us and discussing the situation that had just happened.  With the other guests being just 10-12 feet away, it was pretty obvious the discussion was about us.   On the flip side, Tom ended up being our server and he was completely awesome!  He was very professional and apologetic about the wait for food-which ended up being delicious and worth the wait.  Will definitely go back as long as we have Tom!~hg322~Utica, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband had eggs Benedict & it was very good. I ordered stuffed french toast with marsapone, pecan, & peaches. They ran out of the stuffing so all a got was french toast. It was pretty bland & the bacon tasted like cardboard. Plan on having a lot of time if you eat there...very slow.~Alesia F~Frankfort, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nail Creek Pub in downtown Utica New York on Varick Street is a unique pub! My husband Ned looked and googled and Trip advisor-ed on his phone for over a half hour trying to find a place for us to stop and have lunch along the Erie Canal and I-90 going east through New York. We saw positive reviews online and decided to go for it. The staff at the pub and our wonderful tender of the bar Katie impressed us immensely. Online we saw the special today Saturday, July 30 was the kimchi burger and onion rings and we ordered both. Excellent choices. The burger was done medium rare, with remarkably tasty kimchi on top with two slices of pub smoked bacon. The kimchi and meats are smoked and cured in house. The hoppy IPA and the rose wine served were on point. Kudos to Mike, Katie staff and chefs in the kitchen! Thank you, mary and ned~Mary W~Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice little local place. Limited menu and no table service after 3 pm  Had a tough time finding location after leaving thuway.  Good draught beers, mostly young people  Had a cheeseburger, little undercooked, my wife had the grill cheese which she liked  Other restaurants, winery, near this quirky location~sophillymike~Surprise, Arizona
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped for lunch. Had a hard time finding this place because the sign is quite small. Food here was decent, but unimpressive. They have a limited menu, which is fine, but were out of onion rings. Small menu should equal the ability to keep things in stock. Anyway- Utica is a big place with lots of choices. We probably won't stop again. ~Kibrown~Seneca Falls, New York, United States
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped here when we went to the concert at the brewery. I got the grilled cheese and my husband the cheeseburger. Both excellent. The grilled cheese was feta and mozz, pesto and roasted red peppers, excellent.~Mom2JTD3~Endicott, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was excellent and much of it was locally sourced which is always good to see. I expected more beers to be on tap but it's a small place and they had a good amount of saranac stuff. It would be nice to see them have some stuff from Woodland on tap as well.~Jonathan K~Utica, New York
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place looks a little shabby from the outside.  Coming from out of town we almost didn't stop but the service was great and although the menu is limited, everything they served was tasty. We tried about half the menu and no one was disappointed.~aaronds~watertown, CT
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have a lot of special beers not a lot of domestic beers do have food but a little pricey it is kind of a yubby bar~Donna M~Utica, New York, United States
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tried them for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised.  Expected it to be a typical brew house with typical fairs.  However, I found there menu to be far more interesting.  I had the Southern Mistress, which is sort of a Rueben sandwich, but instead of Pastrami, they used a very tender pork, with actual fermented sauerkraut (rather than cooked and vinegarized canned sauerkraut).  The combination was very flavorful.  But keep in mind that the pork is from pork butt, so there is a chance you'll get a bit of fat in it.  The side of macaroni salad was also very good and way better than you get in restaurants and it had a very home made quality.  We also had the Poutine appetizer.  This was as good as any Poutine I've had, even in Canada.  Lastly, but not lest, we had four flights, all with something different.  First, let me say that I personally do not think any IPAs are fit for consumption, nor am I a fan of bitter overly hoppy tasting beers.  I have always been a Lager fan.  But I decided to try the sours here and I really think they were very refreshing and went well with my food.~cchamelin~Newport News, Virginia
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were searching for delicious, easy, real food while driving on the New York State Thruway. Nail Creek Pub in Utica is a great spot. We had a huge club sandwich and a quenching local beer. Almost too much food! Our waitress was knowledgeable, speedy, and engaging and the atmosphere was welcoming. I can understand why the locals love this restaurant. Waitress Natalie, you are mint!~adairochester~new york
Nail Creek Pub~4275162~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were visiting the Cooperstown / Herkimer area, and decided to take a short afternoon trip to Utica to explore the brewery district.  The stop for lunch at Nail Creek Pub absolutely salvaged what would have been just an okay afternoon.  Thanks to Tom and the rest of the staff, we learned a lot about the history of Utica, the Mohawk Valley, and Matt Brewing Company, not to mention an excellent lunch and beer selection.  While their brewery is currently being rebuilt, they had a great selection of brews on tap, including a current offering of several high quality sours from Mikkeller, Almanac, and Three Floyds.  The knowledge of the staff in introducing us to the sours capped an excellent tasting experience.  The food menu is limited by design, but creative and well prepared.  We will definitely return anytime we are close by.~MHD31~Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a New Englander, I am obsessed with lobster. I have moved away to the South and can't get it (well I can but it's not good) where I live. My husband and I found this place while visiting family back home and boy am I glad we did.  The first thing you should know is get there about 2 hours before you'd like to eat because there's a wait. When you get there give the hostess your phone number and they will call you when a table is ready. I usually go around the corner to another restaurant and sit in the bar area and drink wine and have shrimp cocktail.   When you get the call it's so exciting. This is hands down the best lobster roll you will ever eat. There are two ways to get it--either with hot butter (my choice) or with mayo. It comes with amazing hand cut fries that are also fantastic. I don't know what they do to this thing but it's heaven on a homemade roll sprinkled with fairy dust. My second favorite roll is in Portland, ME at Eventide Oyster Company but that's another review for another day.  I can't say enough good things about this roll. If you're in Boston you MUST try it and I promise you will be hooked. A++++++++++~jessicaleedj~Louisville, Kentucky
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Down side had to wait hour and a half for a seat, went to a bar close by, worth the wait. Seafood really great we had the platter, oysters really really good and that's from a kiwi we have the best oysters and these were right up there. Great service , staff really friendly. You just have to go.. Boston's a blast.~N4888YApeterw~Sydney
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I get real estate is at a premium but if you have food as good as theirs maybe they should have tables outside when weather is still ok. Use the heaters do whatever. Or move to bigger location. We were packed in like sardines. I enjoyed the meal and our waitress was excellent. But had to sit on my coat and hang my purse from my knee and hold elbows in. Not a fun meal. I would love to go here in the warm weather. Then I would give a point higher~michelle73837~Henrietta, New York
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have finally found my go-to place for lobster rolls in Boston! Personally, I'm a huge fan of the hot buttered lobster roll. Sadly, it was hard for me to find a place that has this. Most places I've found have it cold with mayo and celery. Neptune Oyster has both ways!  You will not regret your decision!!~jgblauvelt~Boston, Massachusetts
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I live in the neighborhood and Neptune's never disappoints. Excellent, fresh seafood and oysters every time. Just be prepared to wait as people start queuing up before it even opens for lunch around noon. Typically we'll go and put our names in and grab a drink nearby while we wait. They don't take reservations. Best to go as a couple or in a group no bigger than 4 as the space inside is small and very limited. There's a reason it's so busy! Amazing food, professional staff. ~KKLevy~Boston, Massachusetts
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been here before, based on good reviews. Wonderful. Today, our host was a dyed-blonde young man: snippy, snotty and all together rude, as if we should be honored to be served by them.  We walked out.   OK, I get it:  the place is highly popular. But I am sure they gained that popularity based on the reputation of service and quality. This man sorely fails to appreciate this.  Like spoiled children who fail to appreciate their parents hard work, this little snot needs to man up and treat customers appreciatively. ~FrankieFile~CHicago
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If i am in Boston, this is a place I cannot miss! Huge selection of oysters, crudo (raw fish). Excellent Wine list. Very small, casual place; no reservations (so be prepared to wair, or go there, leave your nane and they Will call you once the table is free. This tine i had a fantastic black loabster  risotto. ~Rosalita_65~Marche
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was worth the wait! We chose from a menu of different oysters and each that we tried were outstanding. The clam chowder was light and flavorful and the warm lobster roll was perfect. I highly recommend Neptune Oyster Bar. ~Bethyangelo~Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just a narrow restaurant with fabulous seafood.  It's obviously very popular with the locals.  Wait staff, for as busy as they are, were very friendly.~spontaneousus~Denver
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the most iconic seafood restaurants in Boston but you must have patience as the wait times are LONG no matter what time you come.    The food was awesome.  We've had the pleasure of trying a bunch of their raw bar (dozens of oysters, littlenecks and cocktail shrimp) along with orders of the crab meat and octopus cocktails.  So fresh and meaty...it was incredible.   If you can't have it all, at least order the crab meat cocktail.  It had a fabulous hint of horseradish that just made it go from great to unbelievable!   Eat that with some of their bread.    For the main course, we tried the traditional lobster rolls with butter.  As a Boston staple, it didn't disappoint.  Lobsters were fresh and plentiful and definitely hit the spot.    Huge tip:  If you decide to give this place a try, definitely pop in early to give them your name for the wait list.  They will ask you for your cell number and call you when you're up.  In the meantime, head over to a local bar and have a drink while you wait.  That's the only way to enjoy yourself and avoid the aggravation of their ginormous wait times.~sonybermuda~Boston, Massachusetts
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our friends took us here for a Saturday lunch. We arrived about 30 minutes before it opened and knew to wait. Actually. We were he first in line. Obviously, this place has become a KNOWN fabulous place. If you do not arrive early then it's okay. Plan to hop in and find a waitress (it only has a bar for about 12 and about 8 tables with a walkway in between so finding one is easy) then I've her your name and number so they can call you when a table is ready. You MUST stay within about 5 min and I wouldn't plan bigger than 6 people max (maybe 8 tops). GET the lobster roll!!  It is awesome BUT the cheeseburger has oysters on it and was the best burger I have ever had. They have a good wine and beer list to complement the food as well. It was an outstanding experience. The waitress was very, very nice despite the business. Usually that isn't always the case. Also, I haven't rated a "non"-upscale restaurant 5 stars until now but this establishment deserves it. AND I didn't even mention the awesome-ness of the oysters!~Douglas P~Columbus, Georgia
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our wait was just short of 2 hours for 4 persons, when we put our name on the list @ 2 pm. We learnt from another guest that we should have gone to the restaurant, put our name on the list, then checked into hotel, unpacked and wandered back.  Lots to look at in the North End while waiting, however by 3:45 we were famished. Lobster roll not as good as Salt in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia. However I would recommend Neptune just be smarter about how you manage the wait.  They told us 2 hour max wait and they were right on. ~DAD11~Toronto
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There will always be a wait here because it's small, but the food is amazing. Oysters from all parts of the world, good wine selection. ~Emily F~Moore, Oklahoma
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is Boston's mecca for oyster lovers at the North End of town.  No. 1 ranking for Food because every single thing on the menu is unbelievable, from the lobster rolls, johnnycakes to of course oysters.  There are no reservations, and lines form shortly after it opens so get there early. It is an expensive place but worth it.~Clevlander~Springfield, Illinois
Neptune Oyster~535627~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Worried this was a mediocre tourist trap but it wasn't. Best octopus and anchovies we've ever had. Great oysters. Long wait to get in but they took our number and called us when we were up. ~Paul and Kim A~Toronto
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always love Greek food and this is a great example of why. Lovely spot dressed in all white. Friendly and helpful staff. Just order one of every starter and sit back with a bottle of wine and enjoy life and the world passes by. That may not be the best advice because their entrees looked awesome too!~DJBradachNaples_FL~Naples, FL
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cool spot, gorgeous decor, great atmosphere, excellent menu, and delicious food. Service was fantastic and attentive. We'll definitely return.~Richard H~Great Neck, New York
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was visiting NY for work and wanted to find a new place in midtown to eat with family. I found Nerai based on Trip Advisor reviews. Thanks to all who shared. We loved the selection of Greek wines, all new to us. The staff listened to our preferences and made really good selections. As everything sounded so good, we ordered a variety of small dishes and main dishes to share. All were delicious but the stand out was the squid ink pasta with lobster. The service was very good, and so was the ambience, lively but not so loud we couldn't talk. I also like that the menu prices are all in so no additional tip. This was a great find and we will go back.~Agent9~Undisclosed Location
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of my favorite Greek restaurants in the city. Delicious food, beautiful space and great service. Love the Greek salad, spreads and lavraki. Not cheap.~letsgovamos~New York City, New York
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service impeccable and attention to detail seems routine. We had reservation and were seated promptly.Nice selection of wines and cocktails. We had pita w/ 3 dips, all dips had fresh tasting ingredients, calamari had light breading & meatballs were light & flavorful. Member of our party of 4 was a vegetarian, so one entree choice only. Other entree choices included lemon chicken, & fresh fish entrees were light & flavorful. This was a no tipping restaurant & prices reflected that. Would return.~Syracuse_9~Syracuse, NY
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The server Tim was outstanding.  He made us laugh, he helped us decide, and his enthusiasm and pleasantness enhanced our experience enormously. Ask for Tim! Be aware of one thing, though.  In general, the proportions are small.~Mitzi P~New York City, New York
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This has got to be one of the best restaurants I have eaten in. This restaurant serves sophisticated Greek cuisine. The food and service was next to none. We dined with 6 people and every dish was amazing - A must visit~JoAndreou~London, United Kingdom
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a light and airy restaurant that I would describe as 'Modern Greek' . So no plate smashing, crazy dancing and complimentary ouzo, but good food and very friendly service. Portions are large and everything was definitely very fresh. A limited menu - always a good thing!~foxbat~london
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is definitely a very high end restaurant that delivers top food choices for anyone who is looking for eclectic pieces. Greek specialties are amazing. ~JetSetter922~New York City, New York
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant was so amazing. Took my wife for her birthday and had a great time. The steak and lamb was amazing. The staff is SO attentive and take care of everything. The apps and wine were so good. This was our first restaurant were there was no tipping. Highly recommended. ~Susan T~Jacksonville, Florida
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed our evening very much and definitely would return. The shared appetizer assortment was a great start. We also truly appreciated the introduction to fabulous Greek wines. The setting was A+ with groovy music and hip decor. The main waiter was very inattentive to us despite our table right next to his server station. He was saved by remarkably attentive service from the assistant waiter who catered to our every need. Still a wonderful restaurant sure to please.~sondra s~Vail, Colorado
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Nerai Halloween 2016.  It was my birthday.  The room was packed.  Our table was comfortable, the room is attractive and our first waiter was charming and funny. We were encouraged to share, which my husband and I enjoy doing and to order an artichoke dish that is very popular and lavraki, a sea bass.  We also ordered the zucchini and eggplant chips.   The artichoke was without a single interesting flavor.  It was overcooked and in a very uninteresting sauce.  The fish was only so-so- -nothing special.  The chips were ok. The best part of the meal to me was the bread and the spread for the bread. I love flavorful well prepared food with an element of creativity.  Nerai had none of that going for it.  I would not return.~hpeep54~New York
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With many trip advisor reports, I agree that Nerai has many pluses:  An elegant well-designed dining room, very attentive service that responds instantaneously to a raised pinky, and a creative arty look of the food that reminds one of Manhattan's 3-star French restaurant 'Daniel's'.   My first visit to Nerai was for dinner.  This no-tipping eatery has an active lunch business when prices no doubt or lower than the stratospheric dinnertime tabs; the non-tipping rule notwithstanding.  A "lower price" full main course at dinner with a couple of shared courses (sides, starters, etc) and a glass of wine is about $110 p.p., though diners with a bit more appetite and thirst will end up with a $150 - 170 bill p.p.  So be prepared.  Only Greek wines are offered by the glass:  $14 to $18.  The wine I had was so-so.    Would I return to Nerai?  Yes I would.  But then again, maybe I would rather go to a restaurant where I was not limited to Greek wine.~CountyGent~New York, NY
Nerai~4101797~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the expectations were high, Food is OK but not outstanding, specially not for the price. Fish was fresh and correctly prepared but there is no "wow" reaction. Pretty standard cuisine, for the price you pay it really falls short~fernaca~New York City, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't care for their pizza, although a lot of people love it.  I think they call it upside down pizza, with the sauce being on the top.~swtstuff~Utica, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great pizza...and this is location on bleacher that isn't like the one in plaza...this is the original location and the dough seems much fresher. Sauce slapped on top the pizza after its cooked makes it unique. Grew up in this down and every time I now travel thruway I stop....delicious. Get it to go it saves windshield time. PS. This location has no bacon topping.~DenyseAlbany_NY~Albany, NY
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been eating here for the past 50 years. The receipt has not changed . You can also buy sandwiches and other pasta dishes like meat ball tunnels or sausage. The sauce can also be purchased in quart  jars it has a  flavor of it's own. ~Sam C~Frankfort, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have no idea what is so great about this pizza.  With over 20 pizza parlor's in Utica, NY, I would not rate this as that great.  They put out an average pizza at an above average price. However, it does comes in a sturdy cardboard box.  So, it's all bad.~Sgtfletcher~Sauquoit, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just drove 1800 miles in part to eat some of this pizza.  It's hard to describe.  But I'll tell you it's worth the near hundred dollar shipping fee if you don't live near by.~TX-1096~joe
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love their upside down pizza. The cheese and sausage is actually under the sauce. It is great!! It is a nice change and you can eat in or take it out. ~Ann K~New Hartford, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Once again, got a large cheese crispy and thin pizza.  Can you get a better pizza than this? No.  They have been amazing for years.~jetliner888~Whitesboro, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza is number 1!  People come from all over to have their pizza.  It's been in business since the Grandfather and is fantastic.  They also have other food too.~Ginya99~Utica, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place has been around over 100 years for a reason. The sign says "king of pizza" for a reason! There's no place in the country that I know of that can do pizza the way they do. If your in Utica,search out the original location and try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!~marcpa74~washington,pa
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is no other place in the entire world where you can get a pizza like this.  It's got a crispy bottom crust with just a bit of chewiness.  It's not as thick as deep dish pizza, and not as thin as so called NY style pizza.  Some say it's upside down because the toppings are under the sauce, but I say this pizza is right side up and all the other boring mundane pizzas out there are upside down.  The toppings are covered by a good amount of sauce, so if you like dry doughy plain pizza you won't like this.  And the toppings are generous and large...not shredded cheese but slices, not tiny pepperoni but nearly sandwich sized slices.  Again, if you like plain pizza with very little sauce or toppings you won't like this.  But if you like real pizza, you'll eat this just once and every other pizza you've ever eaten will be just a shadow of a memory.~cchamelin~Newport News, Virginia
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the sort of place that you have to go to once just so that you can say you've been there. The pizza is served upside down (sauce on the top).  They do what they do well and they've been doing it so long... why change anything? Prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly, and the dining room is simple. If you like it you will keep going back & if you don't, at least you can say you've been there once!~Cheap Jeff~Buffalo, NY
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We like to try local pizza when traveling, and after reading other reviews, decided O'scugnizzo sounded interesting.  After a long day of walking and driving, we were tired and did not want to go to the pizza shop, so had our order delivered.    The pizza arrived on time as promised, and was piping hot.  It was like nothing I've ever had before.  The crust was neither thick nor thin, but the dough was browned and crisp on the outside, yet chewy on the inside with a good flavor--a great combination,  not greasy like a deep dish can sometimes be.  If you like sauce, you'll love this pie, and, as others have mentioned, the toppings were all sitting underneath the sauce.  If you're in Utica, definitely give it a try!~IronMaven~Western New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Whenever someone visits me in Utica, I make it a point to take them here. Their pizza is a Utica staple and is unrivaled in taste, value, and local flavor~Jonathan K~Utica, New York
O'scugnizzo Pizzeria~968336~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this has the best pizza in town one of the countires oldist piza places food is always awsome and there antipastas are huge~Donna M~Utica, New York, United States
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~"That was really good, all of it!"  These words came out of our mouths almost simultaneously when we finished dinner last night.  It's not that we were thinking that the meal might not be good, but that it was all so enjoyable that the nit-picky things bothered us less.  I would definitely go back.  The restaurant is nicer than you think as you walk in.  The bar at the front is long and dark but when your eyes adjust and the room opens up some (where the tables are) you see the color and creative Day of the Dead decor.  This is NOT cheesey Mex Rest stuff at all.  The main room has tables in 3 lines, all pretty close together.  Service was one of those nit-picky things.  Our main server really pushed the guac on us -- several times including before asking about drinks or handing us menus.  On her 3rd attempt I explained that my husband doesn't eat tomatoes so she stopped.  The worst part was that everyone tried to take away our plates before we finished.  Several times.  This is the main reason why it's only 4 out of 5.  The basic house Marg ($8) is delicious and strong.  We had the lobster/shrimp/avocado ceviche ($14) which is a nice portion served with chips (which we had to fight to keep on the table).  The ceviche needed citrus and an herb (cilantro, mint, something) but we still enjoyed it.  My husband had the corvina tacos and I had the carnitas tacos (both $19).  The corvina was nicely grilled and served with a couple of sauces including a great spicy red sauce.  The flour tortillas however were just tasteless and flabby.  Why flour?  5 'carnitas' tacos are served on corn tortillas (yeah) in a taco holder.  It's really deep fried pork belly cubes, not the usual caramelized pork shoulder.  The marinaded onions nicely cut the fat.  They were delicious.  Rice and some of the best black beans I've ever had were served in a separate bowl.  Those beans rocked! ~Mindyopp~ny
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A great environment with good Mexican food and a great staff.  Their tacos are unique (in a good way), and on Tuesday are half price if you pay with Cash.  Nice!~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friday night and no reservation - no problem. Half hour wait and a drink at the bar. Table is ready. Order ceviche because they do it right. Some flautas for the same reason. Sauces are spot on; everything is fresh. The place is hopping and the food still comes out well staged.  The kitchen has a soft touch - no overkill with salt, beans that are not mush, rice that is moist and everything spiced well but not overwhelmed. I really enjoy the food and the portions are respectable.  Drinks and specials are not cheap but the quality is there. So close to Grove Street. Station that you can park elsewhere and keep the parking hassle from ruining a great evening.~CoolAisles~New York City, New York
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great Mexican food in JC, I've been here more then once and always had good service and good food/drinks. ~Vito D~New York, New York, United States
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food! Great location.  Loved the decor, real trendy vibe. I might as well have been in Williamsburg with the postcard attached to the check. The wall of Jarritos is a selling point as soon as I walked in because it means I know they serve my favorite soda! Their guacs are great, solid chips.  The nachos with BBQ pork were fantastic! Can't wait to come back and try everything.  Especially on a Taco Tuesday when the tacos are half price. Lots of unique choices to try.~Ashley M~New York City, New York
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had dinner at Orale in Jersey City and it was great. The bartender was very helpful and gave great suggestions on food. The Tuna Tacos were awesome. Bartender even said they were Spicy but I said that was I was OK with the spiciness. Beer was good, cold and served in a neat glass. Everyone was drinking the blood orange margaritas and said they were great. Overall great experience for a hillbilly in Yankeeland. ~russman1972~Roanoke, Virginia
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been here several times and am never disappointed. It gets pretty busy during happy hour, but the drinks and prices are worth the wait. If you don't want to hang out about the bar, you can get the same delicious drinks and food with great service at a table. Highly recommend if you are looking for delicious tacos. The decor is also a nice touch.~sgomez01~Jersey City, New Jersey
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the worst discriminatory experience yesterday at Orale. I called in before walking in and asked for one person table and the guy on the phone confirmed they have space. I walk in after 15 min of walk ( because I was craving for Mexican and I heard great reviews about food). What happens next is a classic example of bad customer service ( bad is a mild word for what I felt after walking out from this restuarant). As soon as I walked in I asked for one table ( the restuarant was not very busy- I saw many empty tables) and said my friend MIGHT join. The manager who also claimed to be the owner later told me to wait outside till my other guest arrives and he won't be able to have me seated till then.I told him i'm not sure about friend so he can seat me so I can start with the order since I was very hungry. He said in that case you sit at the bar because we don't give out tables for one person. I explained that I'm 32 weeks pregnant and I cannot sit at the bar stool because at this point it is very uncomfortable and all i wanted to do was enjoy my mexican craving and not worry about back aches. He completely dismissed my request and kept saying in a very condescending tone ' You don;t have to drink at the bar'. I tried explaining my situation multiple times because I really wanted to just eat there but the manager was extremely rude and walked away saying he's got other people to attend so if i decide to sit I can take the bar stool. I told him he's being very rude and I would like to speak to the manager to which he told me that he's the manager . I asked again for the owner because I couldn't believe he could be this big a jerk but as per him he was the owner and he walked away. I was speechless after this because never in my life somebody has been this rude and discriminatory. All I asked was for a chair with support and there were plenty at that point. This is totally unacceptable and I'm going to file a complaint against them as per the NJ law.~Urooj Z~New York City, New York
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Let me start by saying I had a good time here, drinks were great and service was friendly and attentive.  But the Mexican food while good was plebeian.  I mean by this its well executed but very standard fare.  Nothing that wowed me.~Steven P~Jersey City, New Jersey
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Make a reservation to avoid the line. We shared the vegetarian enchilada and flatbread with a carafe of sangria and they were all spectacular! The ambiance was just right (there's a dining space that is separate from the bar area), the service was fabulous and the character of the street/area it is located on is perfect for an after dinner walk (night market and music surround the streets). Definitely will come back again :)~Natsukashii~Canada
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My 30 year old son picked this restaurant for his birthday dinner.  Never was here, nor have I ever been to a Jersey City restaurant.  He made reservations for 9:00 pm and when we arrived our table was waiting for us.  There was a line for people to get a table, so reservations are recommended.  Let me say first that the service was excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive, and gave excellent suggestions for both food and drinks.  We started out with guacamole dips, trying out three of the many ones they had to try (Casa, Bombero, & Dorolico).  All three of them were gone very quickly.  My wife got the Ceviche De Cangrejo that my wife loved more than I did.  Another appetizer, the Chile Con Queso, was as my younger son (24 yrs old) was so very good, that it was really a race to see who could get the most of the appetizer.  The only appetizer that was not excellent, just good, was the Flautas De Res.  The beef was slightly dry, but still good.  Both my sons celebrated with a flight of three tequilas ($18), that they stated were excellent. For our main meals I had the Carne Asada, my wife the Mercado Salmon, the birthday son the cheese steak taco special and the younger son the smoked swordfish w/tortillas.  I can tell you this, the carne asada I ordered rare, was perhaps the best skirt steak I have had in years and the . Hand Cut Duck Fat Fries that came with them were so darn good , they were decadent. The rest of the family could not say enough about their meals.  In addition we had a side of brussel sprouts. They came out crispy and were good, although I personally think they were just a little bit too salty, but they went quickly also.  Last but not least we had dessert.  We ordered the Helados Domingo and the vanilla flan.  The flan was so, so, but the Helasdos Domingo was awesome!!  This is not a cheap restaurant being in the mid cost level.  One other thing to state, parking on the street is tough, but there is a garage around the block that is $7 after 6:00pm for all night.  I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be back~ConwaySBB~Bloomfield, New Jersey
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really enjoyable Mexican place with great food, nice drinks, and a cool scene/ambience. It's a great place for groups or when you and the Mrs want to go out to eat but in a lively setting that feels like the right mix between bar and restaurant. One of our favorite places in JC. ~Hubbito~Jersey City, New Jersey
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The tacos are very good. Interesting presentation and variety.  Bar scene is really good as well.  I will be back many times.~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This high priced restaurant has a good take on Mexican food but it comes at a price (although maybe that's normal for this part of town).  We went there for drinks and came back a few days later for brunch.  The frozen margarita flavor changes every day and they are quite strong.  I had the carnitas tacos and they were amazing (5 to a plate).  The guacamole comes with a few different flavors as well.~croth14~Grand Prairie, Texas
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good food and a fun atmosphere!  I tried both the tuna tacos, the barbacoa taco.. both were excellent.  Oddly they don't serve salsa with the chips, only a variety of sauces, however you can ask for pico (which was good too)!~Michael H~Omaha, Nebraska
Orale Mexican Kitchen~4765657~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great spot for a meal. Great range of guacamole to start and also to share the mushroom tostada  was fantastic . Everyone had different entrees with tacos enchiladas and tuna wrapped in lettuce leaves , and lastly the pork tacos were all great .   ....some of the best Mexican food Ive enjoyed.  We will be back   Excellent attentive staff in nice surrounds ~Robert G~Adelaide
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious food and opulent atmosphere. The server was attentive and knowledgeable. My husband and I shared the Octopus appetizer, recommended by our waiter, and the fish soup. Both were delicious and memorable. I had the monkfish and I highly recommend it. ~Bethyangelo~Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent seafood place. Good service, excellent food with great presentation. The lobster was a very good sized and price was reasobable. The only "but" is that the tables were a little too close together.~Niko1966~Pozuelo de Alarcon, Spain
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food is tastier and fresher elsewhere like Teatros, LEGALS and the Quarter Deck in Falmouth.  It was plenty busy I guess because the menu is very unique! We had shrimp cocktail first that were small and not so fresh. (Go to Quarter Deck in Falmouth for the largest, freshest and least costly shrimp in a table service restaurant that we have ever found!) My  first course ricotta gnocchi with  lobster and truffles was to die for! My husband had garlic clams with spaghetti and it was nothing to write home about.  My Halibut was delicious but small maybe  4 oz for $38 but the clams that were with it were the size of peas, too small to Taste!Michael's  3lb lobster was tough and chewy (over cooked) but presentation was awesome in a beautiful silver bowl with  curry squash, apples and a brown buttery sauce, disappointing! Desert Hazelnut Creme was beautifully presented with "Happy30th Anniversary" written in chocolate but the taste to my shock was nothing special! Decaf coffee was good and the Martinis were excellent but at $17.50 they should be! I had a French Martini and my husband had a GreyGoose Cosmo. The atmosphere was exciting with high ceilings and overly large 3 +pan belled black and white photos of boulders, wooden bridge and a knot of rope. The chandeliers resembled Jelly fish! Tables were close together and the restaurant noisy!  The bar was crowded with an after work crew (mostly men). We went on a Wednesday. Many men wore jackets and ties but women wore anything from jeans and sweaters to cocktail dresses. (More women were casual than men and that's a switch I've not ever seen! ) I saw no men in jeans in the dinning room! Oh and we were concerned that if we ordered all the courses that we would be overly full so we asked the waiters advice and he correctly stated that they were proportioned appropriately so the one person could comfortably eat all three courses and he was spot on. Our plates were clean, we took nothing home! Oh and the bill? >$300.  (4 martinis and a glass of wine)~Vernamg~Boston, Massachusetts
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was fantastic.  We started out at the bar for a friend's birthday and the atmosphere was wonderful.  The dining room was beautiful and the decor was fantastic.  The food was delicious and the presentation was amazing.  Great place for a night out!~Ivy N~Andover, Massachusetts, United States
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fresh, great flavors even in the simplest dishes!  Osyters were delic but here they could have had more or house made hot sauces.  Octopus, everything was sooo good!~binamistry~toronto
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I booked this restaurant based on the reviews as we aren't local.  The setting was lovely, food was good but the service let it down.  Too few staff covering too many tables.  We ordered wine to go with our dishes and were still waiting 15 minutes later.  For the prices they charge, I would expect slicker service.~LottiesmumBelfast~Belfast
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I eat at Ostra for my 60th birthday whilst visiting Boston on the recommendation of friends of our daughter. The restaurant is very smart and the staff very attentive. The food is presented beautifully but a little expensive for what you get. I had the U-10 Shrimp which consists of 5 shrimp served on a bed of ice with a house-made horseradish cocktail. The shrimp weren't particularly large but it was tasty enough - expensive though at $5 a shrimp. We both had seafood main courses. My wife had the Grilled Faroe Island Salmon and I the Local Monkfish. My wife really enjoyed her salmon which was just enough for her (she has a smaller appetite) whilst I was under-whelmed by the Monkfish and the rather small portion size. If I was asked would I go back again, the answer would probably be no. I am however pleased that I visited Ostra's as it is still a mighty fine restaurant.~David S~Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife took me to Ostra for a birthday dinner prior to a concert in the nearby theater district. The meal was outstanding, the presentation was artistic, and the service was almost impeccable.  In addition to our truly delicious appetizers and entrees, we were really impressed with the standards of service. Whether at our table of 2 or a table with a group of 8, every meal was served at precisely the same moment, with as many servers as necessary. In other words, every meal was served simultaneously and hot from the kitchen.  My only minor complaint (or observation) was that the wines on the wine list were severely overpriced, with bottles priced at perhaps 5 times what I would expect to pay retail. The food on the other hand, including desserts, all seemed to be quite reasonably priced for a restaurant of this caliber and for food of this quality.  We would return, and we highly recommend Ostra to others who appreciate fine dining.~Peter_01039~Western Massachusetts
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our first visit to Boston and Ostra and we were somewhat hesitant when we arrived as the staff on reservations were pitiful making excuses for keeping us waiting with no offer of a seat but on arrival at our table things changed. Firstly Jessa, our waitress was both efficient, informative and friendly. Our meal of Cold Mussels and Octopus followed by Monkfish and Halibut were superb.  We watched the "Expeditor" check every dish prepared and finish it ... most efficient!  The open kitchen is great to see but they could remove the excess plates and napkins which would give it a much better appearance. All in all a great experience.~Agnes2golf~Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Restaurant recommended by hotel!! Excellent! So glad we went! The service, ambiance & food was excellent!!!!  Highly Recommend - it's pricey but worth it! You will not be disappointed!~Zabieann~Flower Mound, Texas
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Such a great experience we had.  Servers were excellent, and we loved it.  We had a party of 8 and we were all happy.~mikeoxlong54321~Boston, Massachusetts
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We just came back from Ostra and needed to write my review! For me a restaurant needs to be well appointed and compliment the cuisine, the music .. if any .. must also tie into what we will be dinning in AND the food must be creative , plated with flare and flavorful.  Ostra is decorated with soft whites and white onix marble counters.. the ceilings are vaulted to 25'with white feathered chandeliers.  The staff are also in black & white & were knowledgeable and available throughout our meal without being intrusive.  The choice of fish included all species that you may know but offered some that I have never seen in our dinning experiences.  The vegetables were exotic and tasty.  Ok .. I really enjoyed our dinner!!  Enough said .. when in Boston make this one of your dinner choices.  ~Alphonse D~Emerson, New Jersey
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We loved going to this restaurant. The food is delicious with excellent flavor, great presentation and a very nice wine selection. However on our visit last Friday night, with another couple visiting from overseas, our waiter  "Stephen" was the name printed on the over $600 bill , was totally not with it. First he was slow to take our order until we had to call for his attention, then he kept forgetting delivering items ordered. Later I found out that my wife wanted to surprise me with a birthday dessert and she informed the hostess and the manager to bring the desert with a candle without asking. Low and behold once everybody finished and it was time for dessert our absent minded waiter (he was definitely high on something) came over and asked if we are celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. This behavior totally ruined the moment,   embarrassed and flustered my wife. I had to ask for the manager Alex and complained about our waiter. The funny thing there was an incident that happened behind us where another diner was complaining to the same waiter. Alex was courteous enough to listen to our complaint and despite forgetting some of the orders which were later delivered there was no compensation or adjustment to our bill.  It is very sad to see what we thought of many times before as a great establishment where the food and service were excellent, the whole atmosphere of a special occasion gets ruined by bad and lousy service. This bad situation made us run out and we decided to finish the celebration at the nearby Four Seasons Hotel.   ~Shawn-Weston~Weston, Massachusetts
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited in mid-October for my husband's birthday dinner before a show at the nearby Wilbur theater. The waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful. The food itself was delicious - we shared a small plate, two first courses (highly recommend the lobster gnocchetti), and an entree, which was more than enough food without dessert. But the staff was very very considerate and surprised my husband with a fancy plated ice cream dessert. It is a bit expensive, so I would save it for a special night.~DaniFillman~Boston, Massachusetts
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Ostra in mid October and were pleased with the food but our server was another problem. I asked to order the  appetizer octopus as my main course and she said I should order it as a main course. Believing that it must be a very small app. I agreed. Twice the price and more than I wanted. In addition we ordered a bottle of Arneis. We had just flown all day from the west coast and didn't see there were 2 Arneis on the list. She didn't ask which one and of course brought the one 2x expensive. She said, I showed you the bottle which I recognized but did't remember the bottle we ordered and  in CA that bottle would be 1/2 the price at a restaurant. a Also food came like McDonalds, very fast and made it seem like they were running people through there.~Kristina G~Sonoma, California
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were having a hard time finding a place to eat as it was apparently a busy weekend in Boston. This restaurant was unassuming from the outside. The restaurant was full, but they sat us right away in the bar and offered the full menu. The food was delicious, other than the paella that my husband ordered which was just average.  There was live piano entertainment, great atmosphere, and great service.  :)~Heather O~Fredericton, Canada
Ostra~5572598~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~first let me say that I am a senior, 83 who had owned two restaurants much earlier in my life.  It started with my wife asking for a glass of wine and  asked the cost and the waiter said $21. Maybe this is what is trending the now and I am out of touch, but for me this is over the top. there are no appetizers just first course and second course. I had the escargot and them the spaghetti dish. both were good but nothing exceptional. Service was good but impersonal. this is not a warm, comfortable, friendly restaurant.  if you go as a couple you will be seated in a row with minimal space between you and your neighbors, I am  big man and always object to being relegated to a bad seating arrangement in a restaurant.~Rocco C~Richmond, Massachusetts
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As part of our east to west coast oyster tasting experience, we went to the Oyster House.  It was buzzing.  We got a high sit up table and were confronted with such a choice of oysters from everywhere, with flavours and textures and saltiness levels we had not experienced before.  As Australians we have great oysters (Sydney Rock, Coffin Bay, etc) but these were amazing.  Great to experience the range and real differences in more than just size.  Loved our meal there.  Not inexpensive but worth it.~Myclare~Melbourne
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been here before and in that we were back in Philly decided to go back with a couple of friends. Spilt 18 oysters with my wife and then had a double order of peel and eat shrimp. Food was excellent and the service was great. We stayed away from the wine in the wine list is weak at best and went with a Primm's Cup. Very good but they do need to upgrade their wine list. Wife had a salad for dinner which she liked and our friends both had fish dinners which they both liked. BTW the place is not cheap as our bill with tip was $ 360.00. Not an over the top place but as "Good as I remember" since the last time I was here a year ago or so...~Joey M~North Port, Florida
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner with family on a busy Saturday night. Very crowded, high noise level and standing all around the room. Service was okay, considering the crush of people. Oysters fresh, and many choices. Served cold and ready to slurp. Loved them. Outstanding New England chowder, as good as in Maine. Good beverage selection. Prices average for center city location. Like seafood? Check it out!~Stewart C~Ocean City, New Jersey
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Has special happy hour on weekends for oysters Saturday night 9-11. Don't try and get in at 900. Go early and sit in bar and be ready for happy hour to start at 900. If not don't bother until 1030 and hope for quick oysters. The clam bake was very good~Bonnie N~Davie, Florida
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love seafood and being from South Florida, I've had some darn good dishes. But wow, this place rocks! Clam chowder ($7) was loaded with clams. House hot sauce and enormous oyster crackers in a big glass on the table made it extra special. Smoked cobia small plate ($13) was outstanding. Smoky, moist, and oh so flavorful. But the dish of the night was the BBQ oysters. Four for $13 and worth every cent. The aroma alone from the fiery ember in the center will make your knees weak. Best. Ever. ~southmiamijill~Miami
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In town on business, I scoped this place out beforehand because I was staying nearby and I love fresh seafood (in particular oysters). I walked in and asked for a seat at the bar (so much better than a "bar," because the live shucking show in front of the seats is awesome). Short story: "Buck-a-shuck oysters were nothing to write home about; other oyster offerings were fantastic and priced to match; waitstaff was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive; and the shuckers were skilled and friendly while they worked. The place was packed, yet the staff didn't miss a beat. The menu covered the full range of fresh seafood, including non-local classics (e.g., steamers, Ipswich whole-belly fried clams, Maine lobster, and MD crab cakes). When I return to Philadelphia, I will go back.~ClamSauce~Lincoln, Massachusetts, USA
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Met some friends for dinner and shared shrimp and calamari. Both were excellent. The cocktails were also goid but a bit pricey.  Mixed grill was very good as well. Nice atmosphere but a little loud.  Give it a try. ~TravelnutTN~Seymour, Tennessee
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My Wife and I went here for an Anniversary dinner and we had some outstanding seafood.  I wouldn't call it a romantic atmosphere but if you want some of the best raw bar in town, this is the place.  It was reasonably prices as well.~Scott R~Haddonfield, New Jersey
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a fun restaurant , after not being able to get a reservation at two other restaurants we decided to try out the Oyster house. It was a Saturday night And very busy so we sat at the bar.Usually I prefer not sitting at the bar to eat,but this  time we were entertained watching  the oyster shuckers at work . A  reality show performed with great vigor, it almost made me want to have oysters. I do not like oysters , but I do like shrimp, especially peel and eat shrimp. The menu was full of great fish choices , lobsters, I ordered a crab cake which was wonderful. Getting back to the shrimp , which I had ordered. When they arrived I had not expected the shrimps to be hot, and I did not expect that there would be enough to feed the "five thousand." I ate as many of them as I could , and not having the Walrus and the Carpenter close at hand , I offered the rest to a young lady and her beau who were sitting next to us. "The more the merrier " quipped the young lady.  I know Lewis Carroll did not mention shrimps , but seeing as I didn't have the oysters ,I couldn't have passed them on. My wife had  the oysters and"ate them every one"~acalicocat~NYC
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was great.  My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our fish dinners- Bass and Scallops.  Would go again!  Many thanks to the doorman at Doubletree who recommended it to us!~yogamom13~Boston, Massachusetts
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was right on for us, around the corner from our hotel, The Palomar, at 17th and Sansom, one night of a week in Philly traveling from Oakland, California.  Nice bright bustling crowded noisy seafood place emphasizing oysters with lots of oyster serving plates on the walls.  Our waitress was also on pointe, got our orders done right and quickly.  Walking in, it was so crowded we expected a wait, but were seated immediately much to our enjoyment.  Food, oysters, beer, all were good but the knock-out was the Butterscotch pudding, a real surprise.  All in all a very nice time in a nicely designed space.~design49er~Oakland, CA
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walk down Philadelphia's French Quarter to find the Oyster House.  Fresh shucked oysters with a limited menu of fresh seafood and one turf item.  Also VERY limited red wines (4 from memory) ... really this should be augmented.~4SIGHT~Laguna Beach
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We dined at this restaurant for a business dinner with a party of eight. The service was excellent, and we were pleased with our table and ability to talk. The raw bar items were excellent. The other dishes were adequate to very good. We tried to find small dishes to share and the entrees would have been a better option.~andydeerisle~Deer Isle, Maine
Oyster House~1508413~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow!  From exceptional service to fresh, delicious seafood, this place has it all.   I was in a group of 8 and on a Thursday at 7:00 they sat us right away. Everyone in our group raved about their meal.   There was a wide variety of oysters and dinner options for all - even those who don't like shellfish. The fisherman's stew was perfect - lots of seafood and just the right amount of spice.   The only thing that could be improved was the wine selection. It was small, but what they did have was pretty good.   I would highly recommend this spot if you want a great seafood dinner. ~jch01~Columbus, OH
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A great seafood restaurant with a New Orleans vibe. I come mostly for the cajun style food. Their gumbo and po-boy sandwiches can't be beat. The staff is very friendly, from my experience. And I just love the atmosphere. It is primarily a seafood restaurant, so it can be pricey. But, man, is it worth it.~Disn3yFan~Willcox, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best seafood in the desert. Great to sit at the bar and down a dozen or two oysters along with a good cocktail. I love the crawfish and shrimp dip appetizers. It is cheesy and creamy with mushrooms and spinach. I order it every time.~travelercb212~Prescott, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place for seafood and genuine atmosphere. I really enjoyed halibut with crabs and great starters too. We could book a private room with a wine cellar.~Bruno2124~Lucerne, Switzerland
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have visited here twice and enjoyed it both times. Excellent selection of seafood. My son had the oysters and said they were the best ever. Would come again if ever back in Phoenix! ~Cathy S~California
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I always enjoyed this seafood chain in Texas and New Orleans whenever I traveled there. Now I find one in Phoenix near where I just retired.  The food does not disappoint. Portions are huge and the seafood is fresh and tasty. The blackened fish is excellent as well as all their soups. You really cannot go wrong, except if you fill up on the french bread before the entree comes!~NancyBirk~Sun City, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really don't understand all the good reviews of this place. Visited for dinner, I had the morracan salmon and wife had the shrimp brochettes. Salmon was under flavored, best part was the lump crab with creamy garlic butter. The shrimp was horrible, was like eating a salt lick. Even though the waiter saw we left all but 2 of the shrimp he didn't even ask why which tells me he knows they suck. This place is hugely overrated and is also extremely loud. Will never ever visit again and highly recommend you don't either. By the way when we artived, approximately 5:30pm, place was half empty including patio. We asked for patio but was told we would have to wait 20 minutes until a new waiter arrived. Don't waste your time or money here. Waiter didn't care about anything and the prices are ridiculous.~JustvisitinK~Daegu, South Korea
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just off the Interstate 17 along the side road around 34th. avenue you will find an old looking establishment that reminds you that you should be in the South.  Plenty of Parking this seafood place is known throughout the area as the place to go for an exceptional meal.  Inside you are greeted by a lady who takes you to a table and seats you down with the menu.  Inside you see old fish nets hanging from the ceilings and walls and different pictures of a Southern setting.  Wooden tables and chairs are placed around and there is a bar available who might just want a drink instead of a meal, or perhaps both.   I ordered lobster and my wife ordered shrimp and our friends had Jumbalaya and we all had appertisers and a soup.  The food took about 20 minutes so we talked and with several table filled we still had no trouble hearing each other.  The food was fresh and certainly delicious and the waitress was eager to carry on a conversation with us about the place, her children and how much she enjoyed working here.  The bill was high and we split our desserts so we all could have a taste of the other ones.  I would suggest that anyone living in the Phoenix area or traveling to this part of the country to come and try this place.  Reservations are accepted and you are treated like you are part of their family.  WE have been twice here.  Expensive but worth it.~brigadier192003~Phoenix, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice place to come for a relaxing dinner and drinks. Out last trip was for 5 hungry people. The food was excellent (if you want to spend $38 for Sea Bass...... Other items were all tasty and good. The server never brought butter with the bread and never brought hot sauce until the third time asked......then he acted like it was not big deal. Not good for a nice place.~Loyd747~New River, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pappadeaux is a great place to visit on a moderate to moderately high budget.  Normal menu entree prices range from $12 to $35 for most items.  Plenty of shellfish selections and, for those of you allergic to such things like me, a good selection of fish and non-seafood items available.  Everything I or my family have had has been nicely presented and very tasty.    Almost always busy, but nearly always have a table available for those who make last minute decisions on where to eat.~Gary B~Lake Havasu City
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really hard to get a dish that is just not out of this world. Any dish with the diablo cause is fantastic.~elynch44~Phoenix, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Returned to Pappadeux this October for dinner with my family. Disappointed with salmon entree and service. Ordered salmon rare. Waitress stated they normally cook it medium rare but that it would be no problem. Son also ordered the salmon--his, medium rare. Meal arrives via another staff member. Both my salmon and my son's were well done. Waited 15 minutes for server to check on us. By this time, my family was half finished with their meal. Did not wish to wait and have my salmon replaced. Asked server to take it off the check. Manager never came to table--s/he should have. Entree was removed from bill and we were offered a free desert.   Won't be returning anytime soon. It was my birthday celebration, btw. Would have gotten a free desert anyway.~JehneRedRocks~Sedona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my first time here and I will definitely be back. There was so much to choose from on the menu I had a hard time deciding.  Ended up getting stuffed shrimp. It was a tad on the spicy side but delicious. Wasn't too impressed with the bread they brought out. ~Amanda G~Kingman, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here for dinner on a weeknight. We were seated right away. Then everythig seemed to go in really slow motion. I wondered if the slowness was due to a busy weeknight or if this was normal. So we asked our waitress about the amount of guests they had served and she said it was a rather slow night. I'm glad we weren't in a hurry. It was a little bit noisy, too.  So, the best part was the food - outstanding. It is literally melt in your mouth good. It's not inexpensive, either. But the portions are very generous.   The waitstaff was really friendly.~lifeisverygood2~Queen Creek, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been several times and have been wowed each time we went.  The service was wonderful and very attentive.  We had a visit from the manager who took time out of a very busy evening to ask how everything was.  Everything I've tried is fabulous especially sea bass which I love.  Make a reservation, enjoy the music on weekends and the food.~Barbara m~Phoenix, Arizona
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Pappadeaux based on Tripadvisor's reviews and were very pleased. The restaurant is a beautiful place to have dinner at and get out of the heat. The service was prompt, attentive and fun and the food was excellent.  We were a group of 5, so our dinners varied, but we ended up sharing each others, because each plate was delicious. From the 2 lobster tails and rice, to the shrimp and grits, to the craw-fish - all well prepared, tasty and hot to our table.  We will be back and we highly recommend this spot - for a drink and apps at the bar or a formal celebration - its a great place with great sea food!~MickeyP_SD~San Diego, California, United States
Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen~338163~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~hello my f irst time there  and what a wonderful place the service was wonderful  from the time we  walk in the door to ther host who at the front  desk to the waiter  we did  have such a great  time and it was for a birthday party my first time and il be coming back in nov for my b day for sure when you go there try the alagator~Moviemike S~Surprise, Arizona
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~1:00pm lunch requiring wait of only 20 minutes on a Saturday. Lobster bisque soup was best I've ever had. My wife's Tuna Carpaccio was also good beyond belief.  She followed with trout and I had Seafood Plateau- lot to eat and slow to come but well worth the wait. More noisy than I expected - hard to hear even across a table for two. Well worth putting up with the noise. Service conducted by a knowledgeable, well-oiled machine. Great wine list!~TiMiCo~Lumberville, Pennsylvania
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A few locals highly recommended the brunch at Parc so we decided to check it out. My husband ordered the warm shrimp salad and I had the smoked salmon with horseradish creme fraiche, and we both had bloody Mary's. Everything was delicious and we really enjoyed the atmosphere, as well as our incredibly friendly waitress.~Danielle19828~Detroit, Michigan
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great service, great atmosphere and great food.  Not cheap, but it's worth the visit. French style cooking in Philly. Very busy during lunch time, but it's worth the wait.~familytraveller5~Perth
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I frequent Philadelphia often and always stop at Parc! The atmosphere inside is warm friendly with the French flair, and the bar staff and waitstaff are always accommodating. The food is very diverse but I always lean toward the warm shrimp salad as it is delicious! There's always the option of sitting outside bistro style and people watching as it sits nestled in Rittenhouse Square. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that visits the city of brotherly love.~Beyonce1230~Boca Raton, Florida
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had lunch here with three friends on a Monday afternoon. The sidewalk tables were our first choice, but they were packed and we decided to skip the 20 minute wait and go inside. Service and food was top notch, great fresh bread, we all had salads and shared a carafe of white wine (two actually) and had a fantastic lunch experience. Highly recommend Parc for lunch. Try to get an outside table if possible. It would be a great experience on a sunny day... this place is right across the street from Rittenhouse Park. Beautiful setting.~Matt_in_Minn~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Placed was packed so try and get reservations or expect to wait 60 to 90 minutes for a table. Had the mussels and then the Trout. Both were excellent. Skip the mac and cheese as it is not the best and not worth the calories. Prices are a bit high, service was great but overall a great place for Brunch!~Joey M~North Port, Florida
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Shared a table with a college roommate outside on a beautiful day. Lovely seafood, good wine. A bit pricey, but worth it. A great way to spend a few hours.~Susan M~Woodridge, Illinois
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Such a gem on rittenhouse square!  A little pricey and often crowded, but the drinks and food are terrific!   Great people watching.  Expect to wait for a table and pay.  The experience overall will be worth it!~Mo S~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We did not know about this restaurant until we needed breakfast and decided to check TripAdvisor. What a nice surprise. The restaurant opened at 10:00. We got there at 10:30 and there was a 30 minute wait. But we got a seat at the bar. I had the buttermilk pancakes and my wife had the french toast. Both were delicious.  But they also served us bread. The best cranberry raison nut bread ever. We could have made that the whole meal.  The restaurant is also an experience, resembling a true French Cafe in Paris. Go there !~PAWMAW1983~Sandy Springs, Georgia
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner at the Parc for our friend's birthday and we were not disappointed. Every single item we ordered was special. I will be dreaming about the lobster bisque. We also ordered the ricotta ravioli which was so light and heavenly, and the mushroom tart, which was also delicious. The Pamplemousse cocktail was well worth it as well. We would definitely go back. Service was great too.~Deb B~Toronto, Canada
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have spent a lot of time in France and Parc nails the French Bistro Experience. Late lunch off Rittenhouse Square. Everyone ordered and loved the Lobster Roll, which is not the traditional N. England Lobster Roll we all know.  Filled up on their wonderful breads, and talked the afternoon away over some very good cappuccinos.  On a nice day, I would avoid the urge to eat outside as the traffic and exhaust almost at table side would ruin the experience.~AlanR27~New York City, New York
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went there with colleagues for a work dinner and got an onion soup an a beuf bourguignonne simply perfect. We chose a bottle of Pinot Nero and everything went in the right way. In particular the beuf burguignonne was prepared with the Alain Ducasse recipe, very difficult technically  No information about the bill, they pay for us, but the restaurant worths a visit!~milko z~Genoa, Italy
Parc Brasserie~1134529~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While visiting friends in Philadelphia this restaurant came highly recommended and definitely lives up to it's great reputation. The staff is very friendly and helpful! The atmosphere is beautiful and makes for a very posh evening with friends. I couldn't have been more satisfied with my drinks, food and service. After this experience Parc will come highly recommended to my friends and family. Can't wait to return for another great time! ~KristiKouture~New York City, New York
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Awesome restaurant but expect a huge wait. Seating for 30-45 and waits for over an hour can be expected. That being said its worth it. Best pasta in the area by a mile~The_Traveling_Ben~Syracuse, New York
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Can't say enough for the wonderful meal we experienced at Pastabilities!  The much touted hot tomato oil and fresh bread did not disappoint! Absolutely delicious!  And the house salad balanced well with the spiciness of the house sauce! Can't wait to go back!  We had no trouble getting s table at 5:30 on a Thursday night but noticed the long wait for tables shortly after we arrived! Worth the wait though!~margaret h~Hornell, New York
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited Pastabilities with my daughter for the first time.  It did not disappoint.  The bread and dipping sauce that they start off with was amazing.  I had a pomegranate martini and given the chance, I'd have one again.  My daughter had fettuccine with shrimp and had penne vodka sauce with shrimp - both dishes were substantial and amazing!  Tip for visitors: GO FOR AN EARLY DINNER!   I'd read reviews which said there's always a wait, so we decided to go as soon as they opened for dinner at 5.  Glad we did because we were seated fairly quickly but by the time we finished our meal the place was packed with a 30 wait.  Needless to say, I would gladly return. ~Toyatravels~Rockaway, New Jersey
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~IT has A VERY eclectic menu at all times.  You may have to wait as it is a relatively small place, but it will be worth your while.~Adrian L~Cicero
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was a short 10 minute walk from the Marriott hotel downtown; very pleasant and safe.   I got a little turned around and arrived in the back alley of the restaurant but was directed through the back door by a very friendly man who walked me to the hostess stand.   It was national pasta day so they had all wine 1/2 price.   I enjoyed the complimentary bread and spicey tomato dip (yum) and had the bolognese paparadelle for dinner.   It was more than enough food for one person.  I took the other half with me.  I took some peanut butter pie for dessert.~yoginor~Atlanta, Georgia
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not to be bias, but New Jersey has some of the best Italian restaurants. This place is terrific.  The Tomato & hot oil is their specialty that kicks the meal off. Both my wife and I had ravioli dishes.  Her's with red sauce, mine with pesto. Excellent!  Ravioli was even al dente on the edges, cooked to perfection. Our waitress Bridgett made us feel right @ home!  She was a 10!~hep734~Bernardsville, New Jersey
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ok - if you're checking about it - you've probably got a recommendation about it. And yes - all is true! Food is exceptional good! The tomato sauce and bread that was served to the table was definitely one of the best ever I had. Although I took the fettuccine carbonara which was excellent- next time for sure will take one of the tomato based sauces / meat sauce pasta...or Lasagna :) prices are very decent. Service was also exceptional good, kind and courteous! The only thing is that due to their success, no reservations are taken, and will only sit you when your all party is there... Waiting to get back!!!~Gilad I~Poughkeepsie, New York, United States
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our driver from the Hilton recommended this place and it really didn't disappoint. Though the place was packed and people were queuing out of the door we were able to get a table in 45 mins. Staff were excellent. We were able to take our time over the meal. Spicy tomato sauce was amazing as were the meatballs.   Staff were all immaculately presented and really knowledgeable and friendly. One of the nicest dinner experiences from start to finish.   If you are in Syracuse this place is a must. ~benwalkeris~Farndon, United Kingdom
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pastabilities has become one of our favorite spots when visiting in Syracuse. They don't accept reservations which means the wait can be long some nights. The night we visited ( a Saturday) the wait was almost two hours. The popularity of this place has exploded since it appeared on the show Diners, Drive ins and Dives. That said, the food is outstanding and the service above average. Each meal comes with their homemade bread and "Hot Tom sauce". Delicious!  I had the carbonara with penne and it was absolutely delicious. The wine offering is adequate but nothing special. The restaurant makes their own breads and operates a bakery across the street.  If you're looking for good Italian food and a fun night out I highly recommend Patasbilities.~Dana S~West Harwich, Massachusetts
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are many great restaurants in Syracuse but the homemade bread, signature Hot Tomato Oil and homemade pasta put this place at the top.  They do not take reservations so do early or go late.  If you must go prime time, the bar is a great option to eat at,~John K~Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Though the wait was longer than we would have liked (75 minutes), it was worth it!! The service, food, and atmosphere were great!! Drove in from Rochester and would def visit again!!~amg1102~Webster, NY
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We eat here a lot and it's always consistently great. Duck pizza, chicken Parmesan, fish are delicious.  Get there early and prepare to wait.  Great spot~MMSS~Central, NY
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been to Pastabilities several times and the food has been excellent each time.  The service is efficient, courteous, and friendly.  Lunch time is a busy time and reservations are not taken for lunch so it is cafeteria style which allows for the number of people who eat there and do take out during the business lunch time.  Each time we go to Syracuse we plan on a meal there or stop over to their bakery across the street for bread to take home.~sjsmews~Binghamton, New York
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Pastabilities on 10/11/16 while in Syracuse for business. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Drinks were great and the food was amazing. The duck bacon pizza was out of this world and the Chicken Riggies was awesome... HOT but awesome.~ryan9687~Panama City Beach, Florida
Pastabilities~421547~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~great bar lots of interesting bourbons and scotches  busy smelled great will be coming for dinner on the next trip to Syracuse ~Rockrimmonroad~Stamford, Connecticut
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First: make a Reservation Second: order as many small plates as your tummy can handle Thank me later Not only will the food make your raise an eyebrow More than once The service is on point The wine is boutique Go an hour early and head upstairs to the cocktail lounge. Tell the bartender what you like and they will dazzle you Enjoy!~SusanCFeldman~Troy, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really wanted to love this restaurant. The food was lovely and very well prepared, the dishes small but big enough to share, the location is very good and the inside of the restaurant is attractive. The staff is very helpful. Our waiter was fantastic. The maitre d' was lacking in experience. We walked in with reservations, a young man was in front of us and the maitre d' was in a conversation with him that took a while. The maitre d' never looked at us, never acknowledged our presence, never told us she'd be right with us. By the time she seated the man and returned to us, I was annoyed! But the worst part is the loud music. It is blasting! I don't understand music in restaurants. If I want to listen to music, I'll go to a club, or a concert hall. In restaurants, I like to eat and talk to my husband and our friends. But this wasn't just music, it was loud enough that you couldn't hear yourself talk. That is absurd! I had to shout to be heard and by the time I got home, I had a headache.~Martine A~Greenwich, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I simply love Peck's Arcade. I'd love to live in Troy just to be a regular there. I've been there three times, and last night meal reaffirmed my predilection for the restaurant. The food is "comfort chic." You may order dishes to consume by yourself or to share, which allows you to taste more items form the menu. Do not miss their home bread; great to wipe the wonderful sauce of many of the dishes. The menu changes regularly. Everything is delicious, with original twists and layers of flavors (food high dishes). The menu items are diverse and the specials are so tempting (we ordered both specials last night). The wine options are very well thought (either by the glass or the bottle). The staff is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is very welcoming; we like seating at the bar to watch the amazing dynamics in the kitchen. On the pricey side, but very much worth it. It gets really busy so reservations are strongly recommended. We've always gone during the week; perfect spot at the end of a long day. Tasty food, great wines, great atmosphere. Great vibe, nice crowd.~William G~Schenectady, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like to share and enjoy ordering a variety of small plates, this is the restaurant for you.  We tried many of the small plates and all were very good.  The duck special that evening was excellent.  Love the fact that the menu is always changing.  Also, the chef was able to accommodate some food allergies, which was greatly appreciated. The wines were affordable and we were given good advice by our waiter.  Make reservations!  We waited too long to make our reservations and had to go at 5:15.  Unfortunately, the bar doesn't open until six and the bartender doesn't arrive until 5:30.  So if you're going early, don't plan on a cocktail before dinner.~Claudia C~Scotia, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My children took me to Pecks Arcade for my birthday. We started out with a nice glass of wine. We had the shared plates of wild mushrooms, soft shell crab, and fried chicken.Chocolate cake for desert. The food was fresh, tasty, and filling. The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly, and fast. Very enjoyable restaurant.~Robert M~Troy
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I enjoyed a truly sublime meal here, with attentive, appropriately leisurely service, and outstanding food. Upon arrival, we were given generous tastes of a great Cava sparkling wine, and the courtesy touches continued through the meal - house-baked bread (on the menu for $5, but complimentary for us), the roasted carrot small plate, and even a dessert to accompany the two we had ordered. Everything was delicious, creative prepared and plated. The standout was octopus - something I never liked before, but at Peck's it was tender, slightly charred, and almost melting in the mouth. Great cocktails - and when our server brought me a different cocktail from that which I'd ordered, he said, keep it, enjoy, and I'll bring you the one you ordered next. Honestly, what's not to love about a place like this? NOTHING. When even a mistake becomes a virtue, this is as close to perfect as you can get.~oldrose1~Connecticut
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I regularly go to Pecks Arcade.  We can both say that this restaurant is consistently amazing.  We always feel like special guests.  The servers are friendly and attentive.  The food is absolutely inventive and delicious. The small plates are small but big enough to share.  I love that they change the menu often.  I highly recommend the octopus.  My husband is normally turned off by the idea of eating octopus, but tried it openly because he trusts in everything from their chefs. He was surprised by how much he actually liked it.  We look forward to trying more dishes from the new menu in the very near future.~Cate A~Troy, New York, United States
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My nephew took us to Peck's on the Friday before Halloween. It was wild. Of course we brought the median age in the place way up, but that didn't matter to us. We had a 9:15PM reservation and wasn't seated until 10:00PM, but we enjoyed ourselves upstairs in the bar. The wine offerings were very eclectic but fun. The bartender was great and let us try a few before we chose. I loved the dining room. Very comfortable and fun place. Even though I loved it, it was tough. There was a dj playing music and it was as loud as a nightclub - in the dining room, which made it so difficult to hear any conversation. We really enjoyed the tapas menu and the creative and fun offerings. We tried most everything on the menu I think. The carrots were great, so was the octopus. The beats were so unusual and flavorful, but i think there was espresso in there and it felt like you were eating a mouthful of coffee grounds. Nah. Also, while the littlenecks had fabulous taste and were wonderfully briny, they tasted like they were full of sand and i gave up on eating them. The server was really attentive and lots of fun. He kept us plied with a wild variety of wines with each one being better than the last. The service was great. A few minor misses on the food, and really loud music were detractors. But the people watching (on Halloween) was a hoot and we had a great time. Oh yes.. forgot about the perfect egg. It was amazing! We had to order another one we loved it so much!~yecats59~Redding, Connecticut, USA
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Part of the food renaissance in Troy, this is a great place for exciting new taste combinations and a wonderful wine list. Heather & Vic continue to grow the business and the cuisine - all for good! We had five plates - all delicious. Because the menu changes frequently I won't recommend particular dishes, you have to go and experience what is being served for you. I agree with a previous reviewer, it is far too loud, a trend in restaurants these days. If I could have heard my dinner partner, it would have been rated excellent.~xinnkeeper~Kennett Square
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sleeping in troy for 1 night on our way to Boston, we tried Peck's based on recommendation from our host.  The place is very small and cosy. The food was really great with a lot of small plates to share. All dishes that we tried were original, very full of savours and very well presented.  All people working there are very nice and help you to enjoy a great evening.  The only thing that could botter some people is the noise level. Not sure if it's every night but a DJ was there playing music. It was not too loud at the beginning but more and more the evening was moving, the noise level was increasing. Not a real big deal but be prepared for it and to speak loud whit people dining with you.~Pierre D~Maumee, Ohio
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food --- amazing tasting experience, the design is well thought out, a wine bar     with an outdoor court, cocktail bar and restaurant all attached. Do not miss this great find in an upcoming little city.  I visited both Pecks and Lucas Confectionery which is the wine bar at different times, both are exceptional.~rnte266~Wynantskill, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The price tag isn't cheap, but the food is well worth it. The most interesting flavors in the area, with some of the most creative dishes. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in great food.~joesatthev~Troy, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There's a lot to like at Peck's Arcade. An inventive menu of small plates provides a great opportunity for gourmets to try new dishes. The wine menu is well chosen and special cocktails are available. The setting has a charming, semi-industrial feel. It's too bad then that the experience at Peck's isn't as special as it could be. The music made conversation difficult, despite the close quarters. The server, though well informed about the menu and wine, abandoned the table after dessert and our party had to flag down three different employees to get the check. Overall we enjoyed the meal but we didn't leave promising to hurry back.~lupaglupa~Albany, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Troy is seeing a bit of a resurgence (bars, restaurants, etc).  The folks at Peck's Arcade consistently do the very best cooking in the capital district.  we've become regulars because of the cuisine, the funky atmosphere, the service.  A great addition to the local restaurant line up.~Peter A~Niskayuna, New York
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went with the Mrs for drinks and to meet friends. Upstairs empty warehouse with picnic tables and sheets ambiance. The bartender (young male) came down asked what we wanted then walked away for 15 minutes and made some other customers drinks (smh) came back asked what we wanted again (are you sure this time) wife got a house wine and I asked for a Jim Beam was told "we don't carry Jim Beam products" ordered Woodfords told we " only have well bourbon". Wth is well bourbon? Should known then. Order it (on the rocks) and was told "we only sell it (on the rocks) or neat". Where'd they get this guy? I didn't see it but my friend did. This bone head grabs the ice with his bare hand and puts it in my glass. The name of this "bourbon" is back dirt. Tastes just like the name and apparently it's $13 a glass. Watered down cheap liquor at a premium price with bozo, unsanitary service. All in the pretence of being trendy. Lots if other options go some place else~NewYorkBighawk68~new york
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a fabulous evening at Peck's Arcade!  There were 4 of us and I was a bit worried as to how everyone would like the menu. I'm a vegetarian but the other 3 were not. The menu has so many wonderful vegetarian options but not a lot of meat. Well silly me shouldn't have worried!  We ordered 6 or 7 items to share (only 1 with meat) and we all loved every single dish. The drink menu was interesting & good and the service was outstanding!  I wish I could remember the waiters name (young, blond, from Oregon I think) because I'd sing his praise!!!!  He was fabulous in every way; knew his beers & wines, the food & was so nice & added to the enjoyment of the menu. We can't wait to visit Triy again & head back to Pecks for a creative fabulous evening!~offto~Pittsburgh PA.
Peck's Arcade~7376336~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While writing this review I was quite conflicted.  The food is absolutely spectacular.  However, the service was schizophrenic in the worst way possible.  To call it slow doesn't do it justice.  Its pathologically sadistic in how we were blatantly ignored much of the time. We had a dinner reservation and were promptly seated.  Water was poured for us, and we were told that our server (Kwan?) would be with us shortly.  We then sat for nearly 20 minutes waiting, and waiting, to the point where we were seriously debating just walking out.  All the while, random other wait staff were refilling our water glasses.  I flagged down a random person to inquire when our actual server would stop by to take our order.  Finally, nearly 30 minutes after being seated, he came by, apologized for the wait, and comped us glasses of champagne.  We placed our drink orders, asked a few questions about the menu, and told him that we'd be ready to order food as soon as he brought our drinks.  Thus began the next waiting period, where it took another 10 minutes for our drinks, and we finally ordered our food (its now nearly 45 minutes since being seated). All the while that we were waiting our server walked past us multiple times, without even acknowledging us. From that point forward, food came out fairly quickly, because the head chef was bringing it out.  That's a rather odd approach, but it worked well here.  The chef is clearly quite proud of his work, and always explained his inspiration or cooking process for each dish. The food itself was simply amazing.  As a San Francisco area resident, i'm fortunate enough to have a wide array of quality dining options.  Peck's could easily compete with them.  Everything we ate was delicious, expertly plated, and well conceived.  The house bread was right out of the oven.  The pasta dishes were all fresh & flavorful.   Once we finished eating, we were back in the hands of our server, and the flow ground to a halt yet again.  the table was cleared, random people refilled our waters, but no dessert menu for many minutes.  The same slow process was repeated all over again, and once pur desserts were served, they were fantastic.  We even received a complimemtary extra desert, whcih was also great.  In summary, the food is top notch.  The service is beyond slow.~netllama~Sf Bay Area
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~A relaxing way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon in NYC. This is an amazing culinary experience but the staff is extraordinary.  Our four hour experience began as we stepped in the door. Your reception is warm and you immediately know you are in for a brilliant experience. We've eaten at French Laundry a few times so we did hope this too would be amazing. We ordered one chefs tasting and one vegetable tasting. 9 courses of culinary brilliance. The oysters and pearls could be the best thing I ever ate. Expensive and worth it. ~mahlonjanwhittle~Kailua-Kona, Hawaii
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~As a special occasion I dined here. I've frequented a number of Mr. Keller's establishments and Per Se, like the others I've visited doesn't disappoint. Wonderful ambiance, service, and food. Highly recommend!~Bren T~Chicago, Illinois
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Believe the hype, this truly is an excellent dining experience. This was on our bucket list for a while, and we were recently able to enjoy it.  From the first moment, and a glass of chilled champagne being poured, to the last sip of aged Calvados the staff did an amazing job celebrating our anniversary.  A 9 course tasting menu, and expertly paired wines meant that we were leaving all of our decisions to the experts, I would highly recommend doing that so that you can really just enjoy the entire experience.  A wonderful experience and a masterclass in service.   The only small thing that I noticed was the behaviour of the other diners. I loved, and appreciated the the formal dining room, and the request to dress appropriately, some of my fellow diners though were spending their time photographing every dish, and them eating every dish, them receiving every dish. To each their own, but it was a touch distracting.   Great meal, great location, great night out, and a wonderful experience to enjoy, and savor.~newYorkNashy~New York City, New York
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Excelent restaurant, wonderfull service, lovely choice of wine and food. In my opinion better than "allmight" Daniel! lol~JeanPrado~Curitiba, PR
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~From the hostess's greeting to the perfection of the setting to the exquisitely delicious food, our September lunch was an experience my daughter and I will never forget.  Chef Keller stopped by the table twice to check on our meal's progress, and we were treated to a visit to the kitchen at the end.  My daughter's loin of lamb was perfection, and the blinis with caviar were ethereal.  We lost count of how many desserts we had!~trott~New York, New York
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~It's a lovely restaurant for the settings. Service is correct at its level. You are really treated like someone with them. But for the food, I really didn't had the wow factor. After two or three days, you simply don't remember what you had eaten at this place. I'm not saying it's not good. The food is very good, but may not worth the price tag they have been put.  ~jeromesh2001~China
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Just outstanding but too much food at dinner time; hard to believe, but we were uncomfortably stuffed at the end. This is our #2 favorite in NYC, Le Bernadin being our favorite.~Willard F~Redwood City
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~So eating at Per Se is an extraordinary experience.  To say otherwise is like yelling fire in a theater when there is none.  You cannot say anything wrong.  It a restaurant that is probably on many  people's bucket list.  It is like a women having to have the latest designer bag or a man finally and legally smoking a fine Cuban cigar.  It is something to brag about. an "Oh by the way Charles and I ate at Per Se".  It is saying look how rich we are.  The food better be excellent and should be the service.  You are paying for it~camille27~parsippany
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~The staff is wonderful and extremely friendly and this is certainly a worthy experience if you can cut it.   It is not worth the price and the food and decor (think Titanic) does not come even close to justifying the cost.   The two of us enjoyed about half the dishes.~Joseph P~New York City, New York
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~There are many reasons why Per Se has earned three Michelin Stars.   Yes, they serve exceptional cuisine that's certainly worth a special journey to get to it, but it's also very much about the incredible service.   Everyone was very warm and welcoming from the moment we walked through the door. They even saved our night!  We had forgotten our show tickets in the hotel room, and they were more than happy to help us out by printing new copies.  Our waiter, Jeff, was so kind, he seemed like a familiar friend.  There was an extraordinary array of options on the menu.  Jeff was amazing, he kept bringing delightful things for us to try.  One of our favorites was the Salmon Coronets.   I had the Snake River Farms Calotte De Boeuf, and my friend had the Mascarpone Enriched Potato Agnolotti for the main course.  Both were scrumptious!  Then came the desserts, which were simply divine!  Overall an unforgettable, tantalizing culinary experience!~Kay M~North Carolina
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~This was my second visit to Per Se. I made my first visit there a few years ago. The place has not really changed. The setting is pretty much the same. The view of Central Park is a plus for many (although it is not a real factor for me- actually I prefer more remote location for fine dining) The food? Well it is without doubt an amazing culinary experience. The service is exactly the way I prefer it (excellent but not too much). Every is very professional and the experience from the first until the last minute is excellent. My only concern is the value. I mean I can afford it and it is very enjoyable but I think it has become too expensive over the years. I particularly did not like the fact that the suggested wine pairings came at over-inflated prices. I mean there is obviously a good mark up in every restaurant when you buy wines but paying a few hundred bucks for wines whose cost out in the market is 50-60-70 dollars is a little upsetting when you pay so much money for the food anyway. Having said all that, if you can afford it, go. No doubt. But the value? Very debatable in my opinion.~Foodius_George~Athens, Greece
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Unforgettable meal. That's really all there is to it. Top notch service. World class dining. The best of the best in every ingredient. Art work on a plate every course. One of the most self-indulgent meals of my life. ~cheryloNYC~New York City, New York
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Visited this place for dinner which came recommended all the way from New Zealand. The service was incredible. The food was impeccable and did not fail to surprise. Of particular note was the dessert course- it just kept coming like wave after wave of sumptuous comfort food executed with the finesse of an artist. Had I known I would have only nibbled at the bread selection. The butter was like cheese. Gorgeous night and a testament to the saying you get what you pay for (it was expensive but worth it)~Muzjax~Auckland Region, New Zealand
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We decided to have a culinary weekend in NY while we were here for the Marathon.  We were very lucky to get a reservation for 5 at Per Se.  When we arrived the receptionist was very friendly and seated us even though we were waiting on the last person to join us.   It was a beautiful sunny day and we were seated by the window overlooking Central Park.  Chris was our head waiter and went above and beyond to make our experience exceptional.  I almost never rate a restaurant excellent but the food and staff made the three hour lunch deserve the best rating they could receive.  The staff were always present but never intrusive, extremely professional and pleasant. Sometimes you arrive at a restaurant of this caliber and the staff are pretentious.  This was definitely not an issue at Per Se.  We opted for the 9 course lunch---be hungry.  I had read before arriving to plan for 2 1/2 to 3 hours for lunch and we were actually there over 3 hours.  It did not seem like a long time and i attribute this to the staff and the pacing of the food.  This is an exceptional place and I would recommend it to anyone who loves food.  The combination of flavors and textures were truly a work of art.  The presentation of the food is also an integral part of what makes this place special. I have eaten at many Michelin star rated restaurants but this one rises to the top of my list.~Milton06~Houston, Texas
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~We have visited Yountville and were thrilled at French Laundry, so we came with some apprehension after hearing some of the recent reports of decline of Per Se. (New York Times Review). But we came away pleasantly surprised. We enjoyed smaller Lunch Menu (5 Courses) at $225 as opposed to the 9 Course ($325). And we must say it was really good. Staff were friendly and helpful as we dined with our 88 year old uncle who had a birthday. Thanks for all the nice Birthday surprises. We hope to be back for lunch again or dinner. All really good, but pricing is tough as other top restaurants in NYC are typically $125/150 for Lunch menus. Good luck and enjoy!~LHOVancouver~Vancouver, Canada
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~Went to Per Se to celebrate an anniversary and committed to the cost mentally...but I had high expectations.  I've been lucky to eat at a lot of good places so I know what great tastes like.  I have to say....Wow!  This place is no joke.  It's not just that the food is outstanding, creative, and visually beautiful.  But also the impeccable service, the amazing view, and the great customized wine pairing made the whole thing a true 5 star experience.  Even my wife, who usually doesn't go for the highfalutin places, was struck by the food and the experience.  Save up your pennies, but if you want to experience cuisine that is executed at the very highest levels, put Per Se on your bucket list.~Mr_Barrios~Manhattan, NY
Per Se~425628~New York City~New York~Traveler's Choice~the meal was amazing the service was perfect, per se is an experience in perfection, the only  problem is that 700 per person makes it a one time only experience, too bad I would love to go back.~bonimba55~bogota
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A very unassuming restaurant and roof top terrace. Unobstructed views of the city, not the highest building but well worth going. I did not eat here so cannot comment on the food. ~Simon B~New York, New York, United States
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great dinner but definitely pricey.  If you go make sure you grab a seat outside so you can really take in the city views of LA.  The steak was amazing and the service was outstanding.  A very nice upscale place with a great staff made it an enjoyable night~FiberOptic~Kenosha, Wisconsin
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a last minute birthday party at Perch what a great idea! The reservations to sit and eat were nonexistent when calling the day before. They said you can come for drinks and try to sit. It was great we did get to order food in the lounge. Had Surf and Turf Skewers (meh), Pork Belly (pretty good) Truffle Poutine (would have rocked my world if a lot of the fries weren't burnt). Drinks were tasty had the My Fair Lady, Penicillin & Lolita. Had this ice cream and berries that was not on the menu for my birthday, that was other worldly. It was a great time.This is a must go place. Food is good the views are spectacular and it is well worth the pricey food and drinks to see the city look like that. I was very intoxicating. Don't skip the roof top. It is such a cool place to hang with friends.~ecmd92~Los Angeles, California
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I booked about a week before and requested a window view. The restaurant was packed and the meal was excellent explaining why this was the case. The staff were extremely accommodating as we had a 5th guest who came at the last minute. We started with a charcuterie and cheese plate, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.  The beef predominance of the cuisine was excellent. Our server, although not the sommelier recommended an excellent Pinot noir to go with the dinner.  Desserts were very satisfying.  The location of the restaurant on the 15th floor of his Pershing Square building afforded lovely night views of the city. ~elaine3Southport~Southport, CT
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I stayed across the street from Perch when visiting LA. Went to this place almost every night! It's the best place in the area, with great food and an awesome roof-top patio for drinks and conversation. Had a great time and would definitely go back! Only downside it that it's busy --- with a long line if you don't go early! It's also pricey, but you get what you pay for and the Perch is worth the spend!~Pro_CNDTraveler~London, ON
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited for evening drinks, it has a very NYC feel about it, which is fitting looking at the resurgence of DTLA. Great views, and live music on the outside terrace was cool. A bit of a throwback in terms of style and decor but a really cool places to go for drinks. We didn't have food, but this looked good from what we could see. The upstairs terrace was really cool, a fight for seats though so be prepared to act fast!~LWLW29~London, United Kingdom
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I went to dinner after a play in the city. Although we probably skewed the median age as we are both seniors the staff and fellow diners were very accepting and friendly. The food, vibe and drinks were great. We will define toy go back.~Traveler_406~Southern California
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in to see a friend. She wasn't there but the view was great. Spendy drinks but happened in during live music. Took my drink and strolled between the two floors, listening to music and enjoying the night view. If you want a meal, plan ahead as reservations are tough to get on short notice.~Katy P~Portland, Oregon
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The view from the rooftop bar is dazzling at night.  Friday night is popular and hard to find a seat but there's a line to get in at the rooftop bar (14th floor) after 7 PM.  Reservations for the restaurant (13th floor) are strongly advised.   Parking available at the corner lot (4th and Hill).  There are two separate elevators to the 13th floor (switching off on 10th floor, I think).  Definitely worth the view!  The weather was warm with a slight breeze.  No heater required so pleasant on this night.  (Presidential election protest started in Pershing Square this evening, 11/11/2016, so there was more than usual helicopter activity overhead).  The pork belly ($12)  and calamari appetizers were delicious.  Well-seasoned and served warm.  Calamari was a special so I'm not sure of the cost.  Our table ordered loup de mer ($29) and bouillabaisse ($34).  Skin on the loup de mer wasn't appetizing but the bouillabaisse was superb.  Plenty of shell fish, bite size salmon (farm raised), shrimp and tomatoes.  Heitz wine was a great selection.  We started with champagne.  The white chocolate bread pudding is THE best dessert on the menu ($10).  Latte, tea, coffee was served with dessert.  Perfect timing.  Server was pleasant, friendly and pretty busy since it was Friday night but we really were having such a great time looking over the city, enjoying our conversation, discussing business.  A little pricey but reasonable for Los Angeles.    Ambiance is trendy, lively, romantic.  Wonderful experience!~Peanut4Life~Monterey, California
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The views, the ambiance, the food and the libations were all wonderful looking 13 stories above Downtown LA! We actually got to sit outdoors by a fireplace as fantastic live music played. Can't miss!~skywalker4554~Rome, GA, USA
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This lively restaurant has a winning combination: sitting outside, eating very good food,walking around to check out the wonderful views of LA, all while listening to the wonderful band. You can eat outside or inside. The outside area is heated. The band that played on Wednesday night was excellent. There is seating for dinner near the band or in an outdoor area where the band becomes good background music and not overpowering. ~Travelmaven1~New York
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is all about the view, which is terrific.  And the ambiance of the terrace is great.  The food was definitely OK.  Hardly as good as Patch feels that it is, but is is quite good.  Overall, for the ambiance and the atmosphere, it's a great venue.  Also, the clientele are interesting -  those who live to "make the scene,"  in various ways, are there.  It's a people watching place.  There are a few issues.  Considering the cost, they could do a little better.  For example, I asked for some bread and butter, was told that there is a charge for the bread.  I asked to see where the bread was on the menu, and was told that it isn't on the menu. I asked how much they charged for bread and butter, and  - amazingly - our server didn't know this. Another annoyance was, being from San Diego, we were not "regulars," and, despite having reservations, were shown to the worst possible table.  When we refused it, we were shown to the second worst possible table.  When I finally pointed out a couple of tables that were OK, all of which had "reserved" cards on them, there was big discussions and negotiations among the senior staff.  Finally, we were seated  - none to gracefully - to a suitable table.  What they do, it seems to me, is hold desirable tables for their "regulars" or others who they deem to be worthy, and put the those who they deem to be of inferior breed anywhere. Tip to the restaurant:   It's not a great idea to irritate and treat diners in a way that gives them the message that they are perceived by the management as inferior beings.    The menu is limited, which may be a good thing, since it's better to do a few things right, than many things not-so-right. The food was good, the portions adequate. ~David B~Carlsbad, California
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to celebrate hubby's birthday on a Friday night. Reservation was easy with open table requested table with good view. From the reception to our waitress everyone acknowledged his birthday which brought a smile to our face. We had Martini, wine, cheese and charcuterie to start with entrees of bone out rib eye and bouillabaisse. Service was impeccable. Charcuterie came in a long plate with a verity of cheeses, salami, nuts, jam, dried fruits, and lightly toasted raisin bread- good but we'd prefer they could separate the nuts, jam...etc as they easily spill into one another. Rib eye and bouillabaisse were excellent. We were so stuffed that we passed dessert but waitress bought us some ice cream with berries to finish a perfect meal. Although seated at rooftop on a windy night with clear vinyl curtains and top cover we felt cozy and comfortable. We will definitely return. ~paulferny~Los Angeles, California
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well. Hate to be a bit rude. Overpriced popular restaurant - with excellent view - if you get to the terasse.  We got our reserved table in the plastic wrapped patio, sitting at a low table with high dinner chairs! Main course was a catastrophe: Steak frite with truffle fries - french classic turned into a steak with cold fries and cold cheesy sauce without truffles. Staff was nice. They did their best. We left when the place turned into a noisy bar-vibe and took coffee, dessert and drinks in an other place.~Kirsten D~Copenhagen, Denmark
Perch~2241406~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~very nice place, very classy, good view, good drinks, cool music, a great place to spend time with friends, didn't try the food, it is not cool that it close at 2 am.~Merounz~Beirut
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~ THE place to go for beef dip sandwiches.  Also super cool place downtown LA near train station, Chinatown and dodger stadium.  I recommend going there in the evening when it's less crowded.  It's informal sandwich, side salad, dessert, beer place for quick bite,  paper plates with stool seating and wooden benches.  Watch out for the hot mustard, use very little at a time!~Foodie_traveler305~Los Angeles, California
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~A part of history. The sandwiches are good but a little over priced but worth going at least once for the experience. Ordering a French dip and taking a seat at the long communal tables will give you the best experience. ~FredInCalifornia~California USA
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~Four of us for lunch on a weekday noon visit enjoyed the pastrami single dip, beef single dip, and a couple garden salads. So we ate the good stuff and enjoyed the ambiance. What we saw later was the "Train Room" which is the back room which includes a very interesting portrayal of the robust history of L.A. railway system. The room has "a 16-foot long display case filled with 14 archival pictures and 26 models of freight cars, passenger cars, street cars and locomotives" it is well worth a look for the railway aficionados.  Easy parking lot surrounding the building. Close to Chinatown too.~John G~Afton, Minnesota
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~I read about this place on TripAdvisor and, after a Rams game, decided to head over there for a bite to eat. They were just getting ready to close and I yelled and waved my arms and the nice man that was going to close up actually waited for us so we could go in. Boy, I'm so glad he did! The French dip was amazing, I had the beef, the potato salad and pickle were excellent also and I'm not a potato salad person  In addition to that, the beer was ice cold, cheaper and so much better then the beer we had at the game.  We were so impressed with the dinner that we went back the next morning for breakfast. Another great meal at a very reasonable price.  We will be back for sure!!~Jeralee S~Ventura, California
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~It is a sandwich consisting of bread and meat... not amazing..  BUT, the history of the place mandates a visit into what feels like 1930's LA.~Ed B~Laguna Beach
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~Located on a corner of chinatown , we recommended : > turkey dip > cheese sandwich  > soups of the day > macaroni salad  great sandwich original and tasty ! really delicious!~KatlynSanchez~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~This is the oldest restaurant in LA so it has that going for it. Saw dust on the floor. Beef dip is the big deal here, but I find it basic and actually abit dry. The place is always packed , but lines more pretty quick. Bathroom was very dirty.~Props555~Simi Valley, California
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~This restaurant is one of a kind. sawdust on the floor, lines form in front of old fashioned "meat counters"  and you give your orders to the sandwich makers behind the counters.  many of them have been there for years and they are quick and efficient.  order the sandwich "double-dipped, so the bread is wet and rich with the au jus - beef, lamb, or whatever, but i always order the beef, with potato salad and a dill pickle -   my mother took me to this place when i was a child, and then i continued the tradition with my kids.   it's always packed and you'll see judges, attorneys, celebrities, homeless and just plain folks.  it's a down-home kind of place so don't expect tablecloths.  oh, and try the mustard - it is like nothing you've tried before. buy a bottle to take home.~kmckee3730~Santa Barbara, California
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~Three us went , we had lamb, beef and turkey, French dipped , the lamb was the choice of the three but they all hit the spot.   The setup is similar to a fast food one with lines of people queuing to order at different tills , think Mac Donald's from the 30's. Its a unique experience and well worth the trouble if your in LA . ~teflontinker~Birmingham, United Kingdom
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~Try to stop here each time I visit LA. It is an Order at the Counter type place. There will be lines, but it moves, and your order is prepared on the spot. Sitting in three areas. Really delicious sandwiches...and I can not resist the pies. Hope this place never goes away. Located on a corner of Chinatown. Free parking.~Milliemarie46~Virginia
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~Very busy for lunch but the lines move pretty quick. Excellent French dip sandwiches. I had the beef and it was the best I've ever had. Great sides as well. Pickle and Mac salad were a great side addition. .89 for a lemonade is a steal as well.      I will re-visit for sure!~Keith L~Westlake Village, California
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~Visited while with locals who decided we couldn't miss the food and experience!  Great sandwiches and sides. A must!~MsLisaS~Franklin, Tennessee
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~We visited Philippe's after seeing it on man v food. I was a bit wary after having been seriously disappointed with Katz deli in NYC.. however, Philippe's restored our faith in Adam Richman's opinion!  We got a turkey & a beef double dipped, sides of coleslaw, pickles & macaroni salad and 2 soft drinks, it was just over $20! Amazing value. All the food was excellent and really tasty. The beef was nice and lean.  There is parking on site, the car park was full at first but by the time we drove around the block we managed to catch someone leaving so don't let this put you off if you can't get a space straight away. We had a car but there is also a train station in walking distance.  We will definitely be back!~Maleficent_7~Glasgow, United Kingdom
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~We were in the area for the Cubs playoff game and found this place online. It was great! Super crowded, there were tons of people in Cubs gear or Dodger shirts! They move you through pretty fast. You stand in line to order and pay and then search for a table. They are long tables and you may end up sharing a table with strangers, but everyone was nice and you can always talk baseball or the 'where are you from' convo. Good food! We got the French dip 'wet' and it was great. Good bread, nice amount of meat. We also tried the potato salad and Mac salad. There was a little too much celery in both. But they were fresh and cold! We will go here if ever in the area again!!~Shannon M~Tucson, Arizona, United States
Philippe the Original~364721~Los Angeles~California~Traveler's Choice~What started as a bucket list item will be a regular event when in LA. Great food, service, and old LA feel make this institution worth a stop for a quick lunch. ~ibnevrywrmn~Englewood, Colorado
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always fresh and healthy ingredients. Consistent and reasonably priced. Utica is blessed to have suck a restaurant.~Bob S~Utica, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been eating at Pho Mekong for 10 years now.  No questions asked, best authentic Asian cuisine in Utica.  Their soups are amazing and a super value.  A large variety of Vietnamese, Thai and Cambodian dishes.  Staff are always friendly and courteous.  There is simply not enough space to write about all the positives!~Mountain-Man-15~The Adriondacks, NY
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been here several times and I've either order the PHO or pad Thai..  The atmosphere is lacking but the food is sooo good. What I can order is limited because I am gluten free and cannot have soy sauce but there is a lot I can eat. No gluten free menu but if you know what you can have, the menu is easy to navigate. Fresh ingredients prepared well.~kjgardeski~Clinton, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten at the pho Mekong house of noodles many times in the past year. I have always had an excellent meal. My favorite dish is the seafood fried rice. The menu is quite extensive and the service is very good.~sunlover33855~Myrtle Beach
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I usually order the chicken and   noodle soup to go. It comes with sprouts and other herbs to put together when I get home. I have enjoyed the buffet and sir down meals as well. No frills, but delicious food.~Jazzijo56~South Trenton, NY
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was feeling under the weather so while my co workers went out to eat, I ordered take out and came here for the pho. It was surprising tasty and good. I also ordered the spring rolls and were given 2 summer rolls.  In NYC, spring rolls are the small ones that are fried, not the ones with the shrimp and vermicelli. When I bite into the first one, the shrimp tasted a little fishy, so I threw the order out because I didn't want to get sick.  Stick with the pho, you won't regret It.~Cindy2083~New York City, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If Vietnamese comfort food is what you're looking for, you'll find it here. Outstanding personable and prompt service. Quality noodle soups and dishes. Very relaxed atmosphere. Priced right for good value. In & out at lunch time in about a half hour. I will certainly return.~Travel_Sam_I_Am~New Hartford, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are local or in town cant go wrong with this place.  The building is not that appealing but please do not judge book by its cover, the food is phenomenal.~EnidSeh~Utica, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love the food and the service is great!  Food is super fresh, prepared only when you order it.  Spring rolls are the best ever.  HUGE vegetarian selection, equal in number to the meat choices!  I've been eating there for 7 years+, and I never get tired of the offerings!!  Can't say enough good things about the food.  You're crazy if you don't seek this place out.  It's worth the drive.~SoccerMomBossyPants~Remsen, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pho Mekong is an efficient and dependable place to meet friends and eat.   The service is matter-of-fact and cordial. The ambiance is basic. And, the food is very good.   First off, there is no (or little) obvious signage, so it isn't obvious to identify from the street. Parking is abundant.   Once inside, the staff is friendly and expeditious. Don't hesitate to ask for information or advice. Everyone is happy to share info on what is popular. And feel free to ask for a unique dish. They can do it.   Then, sit back and enjoy. It's good. That's why Uticans love going here. ~Rick S~Whitesboro, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Pho was pretty good.  The size was quite large comparing to other Pho restaurants.  The waitress was super friendly.  Will go back if go to Utica again.~Kathy C~Basking Ridge, New Jersey
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a regular lunch stop for me and I have never been disappointed.  Food is always fresh, hot and served quickly.  If you want to mess around with the ingredients they are more than willing to accommodate you, and for $8 the large pho is very filling.  Classic immigrant spot where little or nothing is spent on the decor (although they have improved the interior and have a TV now) and you can get a good meal at a great price.  Best Pho in town.  ~kmartin16~Clinton, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a very modest looking restaurant that has great Southeast Asian food.  I had a ginger stir fry that was done to perfection.  A very generous serving with loads of fresh veggies (red and yellow peppers, zucchini, onions, etc.)  I had chicken but there were options of pork, beef and shrimp. There is an extensive menu and I suspect all of the items are very good.~BobNepean~Ottawa, Canada
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is like the title suggests, a hidden gem. Like some of the best finds, you don't know what you are missing until you stumble upon it. There is nothing special about the exterior or the interior, for that matter... but this is a restaurant, so who cares what it looks like... The food is fresh and delicious, the variety of soups and as well as the other available choices mean that you can have something different every visit. I had the large noodle soup with eye of round and flank steak, it was seasoned great on arrival, next time I would go with the regular size, as I waddled uncomfortably out the door because I wanted to eat it all. I would easily recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Vietnamese food, you will find some of the best here.~wpgflyguy~Clinton, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant serves authentic and delicious Vietnamese food. Excellent for take out or to dine in. The atmosphere is very casual but also quiet, and the staff is friendly. Not a fancy place by any means, but the food is high quality.~Curators2~Utica, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have eaten here a number of times and the food, the service and the prices are all excellent.  My wife really enjoys their version of Pad Thai, and I recommend the Xau Lan; essentially a curry dish with choice of chicken, seafood or shrimp with vegetables.  The food always seems incredibly fresh and tasty, and the service is friendly yet professional.  The prices are unbeatable with entrees costing around $6 to $10.  They do not have a liquor license, but do not charge corkage so bring your own.  Highly recommended!~Trancedevo~Upstate New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here for dinner on a weeknight. Super fast seating and SUPER friendly & helpful staff.  The crispy tofu triangles with peanut sauce were perfectly crunchy & crispy, and I could easily have eaten the whole appetizer myself - SO good. My vegetarian drunken noodle entree was great - those 1.5" wide, flat noodles with beautiful Chinese broccoli, peppers, and onions with egg were great, and the portion was so generous that I could only manage to eat half of it. My dining partner ordered a broth with beef, sprouts, and noodles, and had the same experience: great flavors, and the "large" portion so large that half was packed for the road.  Our server was awesome - we didn't catch her name. She was very helpful with the menu and very personable - so pleasant.   It's a tiny spot, with seating for maybe 20 people, but if they were packed, I'd order takeout from them - great little place.~GBlue~Albany, New York
Pho Mekong House of Noodles~610588~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in for lunch, the restaurant is clean and attractive. Spring rolls and shrimp appetizers were sumptuous. Noodle soups--huge portions and delicious seafood. Very conveniently located to Thruway exit off Genesee street.  Well worth a 5 min detour. ~Peter B~Rochester, New York
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always have great meals here either with my date or family. Each meal is great. Service is good. There is a room available for reservation. I had joined the e-mail club so I received a free appetizer.~dbteacher02~Phoenix
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Has aways been one of my family's favorite places to eat.  Menu varied but with Southwest flavor to it.  Recommend reservations if larger group.  The parking right in front of this establishment is not the easiest to manage if lot is full, but there is additional parking available to north and south.  It is located at the east end of a fairly large outdoor shopping mall on busy corner where there is also a lot of bike traffic and smart drivers need to be aware and keep a sharp look out.  Trendy bar scene to your left as you walk in the door past outdoor seating with misters in the summer.  Drink offerings are wide and they include a few of the more original varieties with food bites available throughout the day.  The reception desk is straight across from the entrance and dinner seating is to the right on several levels.  Blackboard lists night's specials for the evening.  Might want to call if you have handicapped person with you to ensure seating on the lowest level.  Service friendly and they have always agreed to make some minor substitutions on the menu as requested.  There a chef's special, which usually ends up so popular it may no longer be available later in evening.  We find offerings to be on large size, and usually have plenty to bring home with us.  Pasta dishes usually catch my eye, but others are partial to the fish.  Areas of chicken, beef and pork are well represented as well. Desserts are simple as ice cream with fresh fruit or complex as major chocolate compote.  They have web page as most places do these days so you can check it out before you go.~Skicheese~Phoenix, Arizona
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Haven't beenn back for about 18 months. Was in town and wanted to go back. Still one of the best places I have eaten anywhere. Right in a strip mall, but don't be fooled. This is a well known locals place with just great food.~Courtney B~Park City, Utah
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had a business meeting in Glendale and wanted to get together with some old friends before I drove down to Tucson to visit with a new granddaughter. This was a great location with a very diverse menu. I appreciated a restaurant quiet enough to actually have a conversation with friends.~hcarnaby~Houston
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the full rack of ribs which were very good, especially since this is not a BBQ joint.  Served with fries, cole slaw and a piece of corn bread.  Sauce was good, and had a nice little zing.  Wife had the salmon, she said it too was tasty.  Portion a bit small, and it was pricier than the full rack.   On a crowded nite the noise level is a bit high with low ceilings and all for good conversation at the table. Overall a good meal.~Elgin1963~Phoenix, Arizona
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very glad we relied on TripAdvisor as this was a success all the way. We were staying at a hotel nearby and got tired of them recommending overpriced (and usually very average restaurants). While I was not familiar with this restaurant, I liked the reviews and decided to give it a shot. All of our meals were excellent...my son had a burger and fries, my wife had the black bean soup and I had the short ribs. Everyone was very happy. A nice relaxed atmosphere, just the right amount of room noise and very good service. We will definitely return the next time we are in town!~Gratefulrich~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a large group of folks go to dinner and everyone enjoyed their meals.  We started with the lamb meatballs and they were amazing, even those who turned up their noses at lamb loved them.  I had the fried eggplant sandwich and it was awesome.  The eggplant was fried to perfection and the toppings added to the taste, would order again.  Our server Ryan was terrific and made sure we had a great evening.  The biggest drawback is the parking,  it is crazy on a Friday night, but the food makes up for it.~Mimi7173~Phoenix, Arizona
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a little wait as we went on a Friday evening and didn't have reservations. The bar area was nice . We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here and the food was excellent. We shared the smoked pork tacos and the aside tacos as well as caesar salads.Service was good, location was nice. We will definitely return.  ~dnunnally2016~Canton, Georgia
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the special menu offfered for restaurant week and what a deal that was! The chicken with grits was just spicy enough and so tender with generous portions of chicken.  The appetizer was a special of albacore barely grilled in a delcious fruity salsa which probably was not called a salsa.  It was delicious.  The dessert of icecream and caramel with roasted pecans was fabulous and I have been raving about it for days.  the pecans tasted like they had just that minute been roasted.  the service was very good.  the decor is maybe a little dated but we always like the privacy of a booth so that was nice.~Cheryl C~Aurora, Ontario, Canada
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here for a lunch, my wife and two daughters. We made a reservation on OpenTable and got in right away. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere relaxing. Nice place to come watch a game, have a beer, and have some really good food. We had The Original Griddled Corn Cakes which were delicious!! We had Phoenix Cheese Steak with wagon beef really delicious!!!   ~Mahalo123~Chicago, Illinois
Phoenix City Grille~335393~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we had the stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon and broiled with a delicious dipping sauce plus the corn cakes stuffed with chunks of melt in your mouth pork cubes and cheese.  we also each had a split of Prosecco which went well with everything!  we didn't have to ask for lemon with our water.  they automatically brought it!  Too full for more food we sampled two desserts.  the outstanding fresh coconut cheesecake was to die for! and my friend raved about the buttermilk pie.  they also have a chocolate torte and bread pudding homemade!   although it had been two years since I was last there I won't wait that long again! ~marsmommus~Phoenix, Arizona
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great chowder and worth the wait however seating can be difficult.  Have a alternate place to enjoy your chowder just in case.~Glenn P~Seattle, Washington
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I did the 4-tasting (4 different chowders in smaller bowls) - all were awesome. I especially liked the one with dill. My wife had the vegetarian in a bread bowl and she thought it was pretty good.   The line-ups can be insane, so go as close to 11am as you can!~Jashas74~Calgary, Canada
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located on Post Alley in Pike Place, this is a small establishment, and the chowder is what people come for. Seating is limited and many take their chowder to go and sit in the nearby park. I ordered the Manhatten chowder which was a little spicy to my taste, but chock full of clams. You receive a slice of sourdough bread along with the chowder. Found a seat in side to eat and it was fun watching the pedestrians walking along the alley. Long lines but service is fast & efficient. Great price for a meal.~_mreneemcgarry~Grand Blanc, Michigan
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the clam chowder but my husband was especially taken with the salmon. Great for a cool afternoon. ~jmdouglas1965~Lindale, Texas
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~OMG, try the seared scallop chowder!  Just absolutely the most interesting chowder I have ever had! Next time I might avoid the bread bowl, only because it sops up too much of the chowder, and I wanted to savor every drop!  However the lines do get very long, so you must be willing to wait!~marphilk~Syosset, New York
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The chowder was amazing.  Quaint little spot.  Would go here again.  So many choices, we each had something different.~waltmona~Wayzata, Minnesota
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a must visit when you are in Seattle. You won't find a better chowder even in New England. Pike Place even won the Great Chowder Cook-Off in New England and inducted into the hall of fame.~liquidmj~Seattle, Washington
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was recommended to us by several people. We were lucky to snag a table as we were there early for lunch. Fifteen minutes later, we would have been standing in a long line in the rain with only outside seating. The original New England clam chowder was recommended to us by the order taker. It was very good, but a little rich for my taste. I couldn't finish my medium bowl because it tasted like pure cream with lots of yummy little clams in it. My spouse ordered a crab roll, which I don't recommend. The crab was still icy and the bread was dry and didn't taste very fresh. We'd like to go back and order something else to give this place a second chance as a lot of people really enjoy eating here.~SDnative5~San Diego, California
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came as a group.  We ordered clam chowder, oyster/crab chowder, lobster roll, salmon chowder, and crab roll.  All was great!~Tony D~Noblesville, Indiana
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here for lunch because my New York husband wanted to try their Manhattan chowder. The wait was very long but luckily it was not raining. I ordered the New England style and it was fine-nothing to jump up and down about but fine. The verdict on the Manhattan style was good but again, nothing to jump up and down about-guess we will stick to getting our chowder fix for when we in New England ~Kathy H~Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in for lunch while on vacation. The lobster roll was very good, especially for the price. We tried the clam chowder and the seafood chowder. They were both very rich but delicious! Would definitely reccomend to someone looking for a hearty lunch at a reasonable price.~rrenfro1~Tulsa, Oklahoma
Pike Place Chowder~944989~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wife and I had a nice lunch last Sunday.  We got the chowder sampler which comes with your choice of 4 5 oz chowders and a couple pieces of sourdough bread.  We also got the Dungeness crab roll.. The chowder was great.  The crab roll not so much.  Its nothing more than a crab salad scooped onto a piece of bread.~Jason R~Federal Way, Washington
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Flaky biscuits, rich and tasty gravy, crispy bacon and non-alcoholic cider: what more do you want of a cold and rainy Saturday? I came in the middle of the afternoon so there was no line and the staff was friendly and efficient.~Valvalette~Saint-Mande, France
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had to wait 20 minutes in line to order and then fried chicken amazingness! I would highly recommend this rich breakfast!~KsueP~San Francisco, California
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had just 2 biscuits and butter.  What a heavenly meal!  My companions enjoyed biscuits and gravy and The Reggie.  But with huge biscuits this great, I just wanted the basics and I wasn't disappointed!~Mystj~Glastonbury, Connecticut
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the biscuits and gravy and it was awesome....Fairly priced and friendly staff...I didn't try anything else on the menu, but I'm pretty sure it would be very good as well. Definitely would recommend this place for breakfast!~Andrew D~Pahoa, Hawaii
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've heard about this for quite some time and stopped in for a Reggie: fried chicken, bacon, cheddar on a biscuit topped with sausage gravy. A mouth full of goodness. The biscuits are great. I think the gravy lacks a bit of flavor but the combination of it all worked well. The cajun seasoned fries are fantastic and the ketsup with a bite to it was great. The pecan pie is also very good and the whipped cream makes it all the better. A must if you visit Portland. ~KendraDawnRN~Vancouver, Washington
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It doesn't matter what you get as long as it has a biscuit. Even a biscuit by itself will make you happy. Anyway you go you can't go wrong.~derrick31310~Phoenix, Arizona
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's so hard to choose what to get, but the Reggie Deluxe is the way to go! When you walk in you see a busy open kitchen with a window placed perfectly to see biscuits being handmade.  I was doubtful that the quality would be that great so far from the south but I am so glad I was wrong!  By far my favorite meal of the trip!~mdolphin91~Safety Harbor, Florida
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife wanted to eat here when we were in Portland, so here we were on Sunday morning standing in a line that went out the door and around the corner of this place. (You gotta figure that's a good sign.) As others noted, you go in, order your food, then when you get it, you seat yourself. So I'm worrying: 1) If the place is this busy, will there be anywhere to sit when we get our food? 2) Will one biscuit sandwich be enough, or will I be wishing I had ordered more food?  My concerns were for naught. The line moved more quickly than expected. We found a place to sit in the outdoor patio. (Noticed they had heaters in the patio, but I don't know how crowded it gets if it ever becomes too cold to sit out there.)   And one Reggie (fried chicken, egg, bacon, gravy on a large biscuit) was plenty of food for breakfast.  And very messy. It started out as a pick-up-and-take-a-bite sandwich, and eventually became eat it off the plate with knife and fork.  Someone in an earlier review raved about the coffee here. It actually was quite good, and came in large heavy mugs, a big selling point for my wife.  And if you don't need/want coffee (or juice or tea or some other interesting beverages), you can always do like the guy at the next table and order a microbrew draught beer with your breakfast.  There's enough interesting things on the menu that I'm disappointed we won't have the opportunity to go back anytime soon.~btindy~Indianapolis, Indiana
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Order the Reggie, you won't be disappointed.  The portions are huge.  It is a busy place, so you might have to wait.  (Sometimes out the door)~Dawnptba~Indianapolis, Indiana
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our last day in Portland and went here for breakfast. So glad we were able to try this place. Their biscuits are so light and flaky it did not dissappoint us . They have so many choices with their biscuit sandwiches , cant go wrong with any order.  Its a no fuss restaurant, serves stumptown coffee too.  Everyone is friendly and price does not break the bank. ~extrakimchi~Oakley, California
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our newly transplanted friends took us to Pine State and we are happy they did!  The wait wasn't too bad, maybe ten or 15 minutes?  They took our order at the counter, we went and found a table and then we got our food in maybe another 10 minutes.  A few of our party had the Reggie. Boy did it look good with all of that gravy!  I had the Wedgie.  Wow!  If you like fantastically creamy and delicious blue cheese, crisp iceberg lettuce and a piece of perfectly cooked fried chicken on a biscuit, I think you will enjoy this, I'm so glad we went and I think I would go back to try some of that hash. It sounds so good.~tschristie~Fort Lauderdale, Florida
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This remains one of my favorite meals I ever eaten. Maybe I am bias though because I have a  love for all things biscuit-related. The portions were extremely generous and the food was beyond delicious. I ordered a Reggie with a side of hashbrowns. I think these were my favorite hashbrowns I have ever eaten in a restaurant, and that's really saying a lot for me because I love hashbrowns and eat a lot of them. Definitely recommend and I look forward to returning the next time I am in Portland~Michelle L~Madison, Wisconsin
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived early, during the weekend of The International Women's Derby tournament at 11:15am sharp on a Sunday morning.  The place was swamped with a line out the door for brunch.  I had the signature Reggie biscuit that is life loaded with fried chicken, egg, and cheese drizzled with the milk sausage gravy.  OMG.  I don't think I will have to eat again for several days.  The biscuit alone is nice, warm, right out of the oven freshness.  Try the Reggie or your can build your own tasty.  Everyone was having a draft beer brewed in the premises so I did too.  Nice way to get that biscuit down!  Excellent.~Fabienne N~San Francisco, California
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We saw a review for this place, and my husband is a biscuit aficionado. We made the trek from our hotel to give it a try.    This place runs quite a bit like a lot of BBQ restaurants in Kansas City.  1) You stand in line. 2) You place your order 3) Only after you place your order do you sit down.   My husband got the biscuits and gravy with a sausage patty.  I had the shrimp and grits.   The biscuits and gravy were really amazing.  The gravy had a seasoning I couldn't pin down. Some kind of herb, and it was actually kind of sweet.  Very good and very different than some of the gravy that you get other places that basically tastes like wet flour with sausage.  The shrimp and grits were amazing.  In addition to the shrimp. there were mushrooms and bacon on the grits, and a seasoned oil that had a bit of a kick.  Really tasty, and a huge portion.  They ask that you bus your own table, which is no problem and I'm sure helps keep their staffing costs lower.    The place is charming with a nice patio.  Come early if you don't want to stand in line!~SusanJRandolph~Kansas City, Missouri
Pine State Biscuits~1017614~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were invited to have a laid back business meeting here for breakfast.  You really have to like biscuits and gravy if you want to eat breakfast here as that is the specialty.   I ended up with a piece of pecan pie that was average.  The others had biscuits and gravy and felt the food to be very heavy.  There is no table service.~Don C~Chicago, Illinois
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After reading about both Pips and VooDoo donuts, and seeing the huge line outside of VooDoo donuts, we decided to Uber it to Pips.  We were glad we did!  There was a small line outside, but it's in residential type area on the other side of Portland so doesn't get the volume VooDoo does.  The mini donuts are made to order.  You can buy in different numbers of batches and decide how many of each type you want. The place was clean and the staff was VERY friendly :)  It was well worth the trip and I will definitely make a stop here if I am ever in the Portland area again. YUM!~Valerie O~Sandwich, Massachusetts
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived there around noon and had very little wait. Was lucky enough to have my birthday dozen and selected two of each. Also ordered a smokey chai.   These mini donuts are made fresh so prepare to wait about 15-20 minutes. They are $6.25 / dozen.   Each variation is based on one donut type which are About golf ball Sized. These are not the yeasty kind. The base donuts are Slightly more cake like and crisp on the outside. The hole of some are filled with Things like Nutella or maple bacon or peach. My favorite was the dirty Wu. It's dredged in a sugar and drizzled with Nutella and very satisfying.   Afaik no other type of base donuts offered. No true cake donuts. No yeasty light fluffy donuts nor any cruller. No Boston cream or jelly filled.   Conclusion. These are well executed and fresh and tasty with interesting variety. Worth the visit and will return. ~joem32082~Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I cannot rave enough about Pip's!  The donuts were incredible--expertly crafted with flavor. The chai was magnificent, I went with the flight in order to taste the variety offered.  Absolutely magnificent!! The teas were made with in house spices and bursting personality and flavor. I recommend the Ginger Rodgers tea.  Enjoy!~melidot23~Cheney, Washington
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just went to Pip's for the first time.  I had seen the week before my birthday that they give a free dozen on your birthday or 7 days after.  When I looked them up they also do chai, which I love.  My friend and I went when they opened on a sunday.  We were 2nd in line and the line stretched at least 12 people long the whole time we were there.  They make everything fresh when you order so it does take a little while.  The donuts are cake like and delicious!  We had some with cinnamon and sugar, some with nutella drizzle and honey, and the seasonal which was passionfruit.  We also shared the flight of chai!  They give you a menu that tells you what each of the 5 different chai's are so you can figure it all out.  It was all delicious!!  The chai was not sweet so it went well with the donuts.  The different flavors of chai were all interesting.  I like the one with the coconut and also Ginger Rodgers.  Very fun place.  Felt like I was in an episode of Portlandia!  A dozen donuts is $6.75.  The flight of chai was around $13.~sarabeara~vancouver, wa
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love Pip's.  I wish I lived in NE Portland so I could go there more often.  If you have not been here before, these are not your ordinary donut.  They are small and cute and have the best flavors.~ClaudiaW504~Portland, Oregon
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'll start by saying I'm a fan of chai, coffee too but only tried the chai this time.  They offer a fantastic chai flight of 5 for around $12.  Two of us shared and it was more than a tasting and plenty to satisfy us.  My favorite was the one with Thai tea while my friend enjoyed the coconut one.  But even the herbal one was delightful.  And how about those mini donuts?  Perfect morsels and yumminess without being greasy or overly sweet.  We got there on Sunday morning at 8:10, they open at 8:00 am and there was already a line outside.  It moved fast but did take about 20 min.  Would totally do it again.~942adriannan~Norwalk, California
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One word - GO!  You will not be disappointed - we could not believe how mouth watering delicious these donuts were.  And, the lines are nowhere as long as the other Portland donut shop competitor. It's also a really good place to get a full experience of the Portland hipster scene. The Cinnamon and Honey donuts were out of this world!~thepratts2015~Chantilly, Virginia
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Soooo good!    Out of the three doughnut places we tried in Portland, this was hands down our favorite (cheapest, too!).  There aren't gazillion choices, there are no pretty display cases (because doughnuts are made after you order them), but when you get the doughnuts in your hands after waiting about 10-15 minutes, it is seriously the bomb!  We ordered 2 of everything, which meant 12 since there were 6 flavors.  I even like that they're mini doughnuts, since I can never finish a whole one anyways.  This way you don't feel as guilty and you get to try different kinds.  I loved them all, so I can't pick a favorite.  Hubby loved them too, it was just so crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, we gobbled them up as soon as we got them.    We went around 3:45 on a weekday and there was no wait.  They're only open til 4pm, so keep that in mind.  Cute interior and friendly staff.  A dozen is only $6.25.  Go get these for sure!!~Sushi888~Los Angeles
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~These little doughnuts were amazing. We tried them all and they were all great. My favorite was the Dirty Wu which has honey, Nutella and sea salt. We also tried the flight of chais, such an awesome idea. We got them iced and agreed some would be better hot (which the menu states but it was hot out lol). We're in town one more day and I plan on picking up another dozen or two for the road. ~Kat P~Denver, Colorado
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~These mini sized doughnuts are from heaven! You must try them all and don't miss the special. Small place with excellent service and expect a long line on the weekend. The coffee is divine as well. Well worth the wait.~Amy B~Austin, Texas
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was not one of the doughnut shops that appeared on every single Portland blog post but I am SO glad one of our friends told us about it! We had 2 of each kind offered and were blown away at the flavors, not to mention they were served HOT.   I only tried one of their unique chai teas but wish I had ordered the flight of 4 flavors. Will need to do that on our next trip ;)~Lylerrr~San Bruno, California, United States
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on a weekday so it was not busy which was nice. These may be the perfect doughnut. A bit crunch on the outside and soft inside and warm too.  The chai was amazing too. I wanted to try all of them but the sampler was a bit much, go with a few friends for that. I'd come back here in an instant.~Atalanta8~San Jose, California
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What an amazing treat Pip's is! The doughnuts are creative, light and perfect. The only problem is the line can be long and slow... really slow. I recommend timing your visit to non-peak hours.~millron~Portland, Oregon
Pip's Original~4826152~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~yum yum, far better than the voodoo place that has created a cult following..tourists with pink boxes look out for these donuts if you are wanting a piece of deep fried delish!~Shelby H~Kelowna, Canada
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing Sandwich,I ordered Montesarchio panini, with Prosciutto di Parma,Fresh Mozz,Roasted Peppers,Arugula and Balsamic Dressing,in focaccia bread.This sandwich is huge and delicious.This place is a MUST...They definitely brought Italy to New York.~sr4412125~New York City, New York
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came in for lunch full of meats and delicious.........inexpensive.......buy one for a few people or save some for the next meal!!!~jmfle~Brimfield, Massachusetts
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great, simple sandwiches made from high quality ingredients. But share or save one half for later unless you are very hungry!~Jette S~Odense, Denmark
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~How have we lived downtown for 25 years and not heard of this place?!?!?  If you're in the mood for an outstanding, classic Italian sub (about 25 variations available on the menu) - then this is your place.  Forget Eataly - this is the real thing!  The quality of the meats, cheeses and bread is excellent, and sandwiches are made on whole loaves of four different breads!  We had the Pisillo to start with, and the two of us had three meals apiece from one sandwich!  Don't be mistaken - it's not quantity over quality - this place has both.  And being run by a friendly, welcoming couple only adds to the experience. They seemed to know the locals immediately as they walked in.~mnbnyc~New York
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for a tasty lunch in the financial district not far from the 9/11 memorial then this is the place to visit. It's a small takeaway that doesn't look anything special but they serve great Italian sandwiches with fresh top quality imported ingredients at good value prices, especially when you bear in mind that one of their beasts is plenty for two to share. We split a smoked mozzarella and hot chilli sandwich. The chillis sure were hot but it made for a damn tasty lunch. Believe the hype!~eddymaya~York, United Kingdom
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love the pizza. It's real NY pizza. Thin sweet and cooked to a perfect slice. The seating is thight but the food is awesome. ~jmax21~Cincinnati, Ohio
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My sister isn't here,  we could've shared this enormous vegetarian sandwich.  I wish they could've toasted the bread. 4 tiny tables. Seats 8. Everyone else has to leave to eat elsewhere. The italian limonata was only ok in flavor.~Kelly J~Hernando, Mississippi, United States
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On a windy day in New York, my two friends and I decided to try Pisillo. For some reason we took our time and walked close to 4 miles in dress shoes, my feet were killing me when we got there. Was surprised when we entered to see the layout of the restaurant. Best way to describe it as my dad would say, a hole in the wall kinda joint, only thing is limited seating. This dose not a degrading discretion in any meaning, it was friendly, cozy and inviting. We were greeted by Antonio,a real Italian, and believe me when I tell you, the nicest person I have ever meet in my life in the food industry. We chatted for awhile as he explained the ingredients and recommendations. Was so happy that they had more can and flavors of Sanpellegrino at a very reasonable price. All of us decided to for the number 4 with the oven baked bread. Now before I describe my thought of the sandwich let me tell you what my style of "taste" is. I do not enjoy cold cut, or non toasted sandwiches, I am not a fan of tomato either, and last I am a bottomless pit when it comes to putting down the food. Now let me continue,as Antonio sliced the imported Italian meat, we didn't know when he would stop adding more and more to the sandwich. He brought out the cheese and tomatoes and added them as well, then took the sandwich and rapidly rolled it in foil, tossing it in a bag. As soon as he handed me the bag the weight was so surprising, honestly like a cinder block was in there. As the classic Italian music was playing through the speakers, I felt almost as I was being filmed for a commercial, or Indiana Jones uncovering the Ark of the Covenant. This thing was massive, but not just a large hump of meat, cheese and bread, this was a proper work of art. I can relive the moment of my first bite over in my head it was, Heaven on Earth, for that moment I was literally enjoy my life as I ate the sandwich, worries went away, hope was brought back. 3/4 of the way into the first half of the sandwich I was satisfied, but the desire of the meal made me continue until I finished the first half, there my body was telling me no, but my mind was telling me yes. It was so fulfilling. Most restaurants in New York empathize on the atmosphere and not the food, and don't get me wrong the Pisillo has a great atmosphere, but even without that it is all about the food, most say the use quality ingredients, but few use the best ingredients. Pisillo isn't a meal or place to eat but an enjoyment an a sliver of Heaven in a bag. Being in NYC for half a year, with my friends from Europe we have all ate at manny places, and let me tell this our experience was so good I seen the most stingy, cheap, Scottish man leave a tip. For the first time ever in his life and not only did he tip once but twice. He said for how amazing the food was and also how Antonio treated and took care of us during our time at Pisillo Italian Panini. Would recommend to anyone, 10/10 would not change one thing about this place. ~Robster117~Jasper, Missouri
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pisillo is a small Italian deli specialized in sandwiches. They offer almost 30 types of Italian sandwiches in four different kinds of bread.  The sandwiches are huge and delicious, they can serve 2 or 3 persons. The prizes are reasonable and the service is great. Recommended.~Gus M~Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~These guys are amazing, and so are their sandwiches.  This is absolutely Old School New York.  The shop has been here for decades.  Enormous meat and cheese filled sandwiches, with fresh bread made in Brooklyn.  Seriously though, Hubs and I each bought a sandwich, and I feel that I got three meals out of it.     Lots of choices, you won't be disappointed.~TummyIsADiva~New York City, New York
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took a different route to work one day from the train and walked by this place, and what a great find!!  Looking at the menu it might seem pricey, but I assure you it's not.  The sandwich was the size of my arm.  It could honestly feed two people.  Bread was fresh and delicious.  Great, friendly service and a good selection of sandwich's.  Go early or late, because the line at lunch time is pretty long, but they hustle.  The owner is really friendly and provides a great experience.  They just opened up a Juventus themed coffee shop next door.  I highly recommend the frozen espresso.  It's amazing.~kmcshane~New York City, New York
Pisillo Italian Panini~6486923~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~tried this place due to the reviews, i should have check their menu first. I agree that the sandwich are fine, but how can you really make a bad sandwich??  The ingredients are basically the same, the one you find in every deli in NYC, nothing makes this place unique. not even a DOP...   the mortadella was definitely not imported, and the semolina bread?? really??  for the price they should buy at sullivan bakery,  try adding cheese like, taleggio, robiola, scamorza, fontina, grana, fossa, asiago,   and coldcuts like, bresaola, cacciatore, culatello, salsiccia, cotechino,   i ca make my own sandwich, the point of eating out is that you get things that better that=n what you can do at home, unfortunately not the case here...~fedrighini~New York
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a short wait at the adjacent wine bar we had pizza and salads for an early dinner. The thin crust wood fired pizzas were fine, but not as good as ones I have had elsewhere. The salad, though fresh and locally sourced, had a bland dressing.  In short, given the reputation of this place, I was expecting much more. ~hkwAtlanta_Georgia~atlanta, georgia
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a New Yorker, I am very partial to NY Pizza which really can't be duplicated anywhere in Phoenix.  However, Pizzeria Bianco provides a pretty good substitute. It is not pizza with a Mexican flare which is what I find here.  If you can't be in NY and crave pizza, this is a good pie to eat.~brooklyn33NY~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best rated pizza around and it's true!  Go early, it's fills up fast, but worth the wait for sure!  Great place to hand out with friends!~Mirjam D~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was very good but the wait was ridiculous. 2 hrs before I got my pizza.  I think the place is way to small.~lizzi621~Sun City West, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great location. A little tight. We went with friends and their kids. They accommodated us perfectly. Nice attentive staff. Loved the pizzas! Kids loved it too!~degabrielavic~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great pizza but not up to all the hype. Good service, good food but not that much of amazing taste that everyone raves of.  Will return if in the area. ~Pumpkinlife~Glendale, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been wanting to go here for a long time. Had a 20 minute wait so we sat at the bar. Very friendly bartender. We had a great pizza. One of the best I ever had. The service was good. Great ambiance and reasonable prices. Will go again soon. Highly recommend.~Mark F~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have eaten pizza all over the world, Naples, NY, Chicago (not really pizza) and elsewhere and without a doubt the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is the best ever. And that goes for both locations, although I favor the downtown spot.  It's the dough that really is the standout here.  So much care goes into every step, it's evident in the final product.  Can't wait to try Chris' other concept Tratto at month end.~GianniB~Gilbert, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been wanting to eat at Pizzeria Bianco since I moved to Phoenix 7 years ago! Every person I talked to, as soon as they would find out I am from Italy (born and raised there) they would tell me I had to try it! To be honest I always got super discouraged by the insane wait and the fact that they don't take reservations... But I get it, that's part of the hype...if you have to wait for a long time and they only have a small amount of seating... It must be good right??? WRONG! I ended up passing by one Monday afternoon and it was not busy, so I said "Why not?" I could not wait to finally try it.  I liked the setting and atmosphere, was very disappointed on the menu, as I believe it had only 6 pizzas!!! Have you ever been to a pizzeria in Italy? The choices are endless and a lot more affordable. I ordered a Margherita for $15, I don't mind paying for good food, but this pizza was HORRIBLE!! Did not taste like Italian pizza, actually I compare it more to the pizza at Sauce.... Super crusty to the point that the roof of my mouth was gone! Painful and disappointing. I wanted to love it soooo bad! I actually asked the waitress if they had buffalo mozzarella and in a super snooty way she said "no we make our own mozzarella" . Well you shouldn't as it tastes nothing like mozzarella! Save your money, if you want closer to Italian pizza eat at Cibo or Pizzeria Pomo. Don't buy into the hype!!~Iloveitsoobad~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My sister, who lives in Phoenix, took me here because she said this was supposed to be rated the number one pizzaria in the USA. There are several locations: downtown and on E. Camelback Road, which is the one we went to. The atmosphere was ok - we sat outside, but the pizza was only average (for my palate). I realize that people have different tastes in pizza (remember the trouble John Steward got into on the Daily Show comparing New York pizza to Chicago pizza?), so I am not going to pretend to be an expert who has traveled the world and knows all there is to know about the subject (although I do travel all over the world and I have eaten pizza everywhere I can think of). It basically comes down to whether you like thin crust New York style pizza (which is crispy and brittle like a cracker) or not - which is what they serve here. The fact that it is baked in a wood fire oven is certainly a plus, but I have always preferred Chicago style  If I do get thin crust pizza, I prefer it not to be crispy. Having said that, I have had very good thin crust pizza at various places on the East Coast, so when I compare Pizzaria Bianco (isn't it supposed to be pizzaria bianca?) pizza with other pizza, I am am not thinking of the Chicago style, but of the East Coast pizza types I have had, or the pizza that they serve in Firenze, Italy. The other thing I thought was strange about this place was that you don't have much of a choice. I believe there were only four pizza types on the menu. Perhaps this is snob appeal, I don't know. If you are a thin crust foodie and don't care too much about the menu selection, then this place will probably suit you.~perryhs~Hornnes, Norway
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~People rave about Pizzeria Bianco all the time.  It's like an Italian shrine! My husband and I think the pizza is good, but nothing special. Lots of other places with excellent pizza and less of a frenetic situation. Waiting in line is crazy, when there are other choices.  The crust is not as crisp as I would like, and the fillings are not as plentiful as I would like. We have eaten here on several occasions. The reputation of Pizza Bianco has flourished, but for me, the hype is very inflated.~charlotte16bars~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best fire brick oven pizza! You could just eat the crust itself. The staff is VERY knowledgeable of the menu. The wine selections are great and the food is amazing! They have their own herb garden on the patio. It's full of many different herbs they use. ~myohmyitsrhy~Phoenix, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza here was the best my wife and I ever tasted. Great Neapolitan thin crust but the magic comes from the freshness of the ingredients. The basil on the Margharita was like nothing we have ever tasted. The Rosa had fresh red onion, freshly grated parmesan, rosemary fresh from the garden and very tasty Arizona pistachios. We'd heard they didn't allow boxes so you couldn't take any home as it wouldn't then be fresh enough but now they do and it is! Please move your pizzeria to our home town in Coronado - you'll like it here~howcrab~Coronado, California
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza was absolutely amazing and oh so satisfying. The atmosphere was nice and I got my pizza quick. The employees weren't the friendliest but I would still recommend this place because the food was awesome. ~Carly K~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza was good. Some other reviewers have commented that the crust was crunchier than true Neapolitan pizza. This is true, only needed a knife and fork for the first bite, but I actually enjoyed the well-done crust. It was a little bit expensive though for what you get. One of my favorite Neapolitan pizza restaurants in the Minneapolis area is less than 1/2 the cost for a similar (but more authentic) product. I am not sure whether being close to the convention center causes them to charge so much or what...~mplsfoodie~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is excellent pizza.  The only people that may disagree are from either New York or Chicago, but they will still appreciate the quality.  However, it is named the best Pizza in the US by many, many pizza critics.  Not to be missed!~GaryRealtor~Flagstaff, Arizona
Pizzeria Bianco~333166~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went here for lunch had salad, pizza & dessert it was all great including the staff! We also loved the atmosphere!~Tammy-L-0214~Whitecourt, Canada
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As an infrequent pizza eater, I may not be qualified to say this, but the pizza I had at Regina's was the best pizza I've ever had!! I had the St Anthony's, and simply devoured it. I understand this is a local Boston chain, we ate at the Thatcher St pizzeria. The ambiance is, as you'd expect, that of a bustling, busy pizza parlour and seating becomes a premium around lunch time. But the pizza here is definitely worth waiting for!!~Rickapoodlie~Canberra, Australia
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Discovered by accident while walking back from the USS Constitution. Extremely popular, even mid-week at 2pm. Great pizzas, friendly efficient service and good choice of reasonably priced beer. Hard to fault. Well worth a visit if you are in the area. ~Slitherin~United Kingdom
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been dining at Pizzeria Regina since I was a kid and now have turned our 5 yr old son onto the goodness that is Regina's~SueMay28~Shrewsbury, Massachusetts
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're looking for a genuine Italian place, hit up Pizzeria Regina.  It's worth the wait.  We were a party of 10 and had a great time while enjoying delicious pizza.  Great neighborhood restaurant.~Debbie S~Media, Pennsylvania
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved the pizza.  Value priced and too much to eat for two.  Enjoyed our waitress Patty.  Italian decor from the past.~BarclayB3~Wheeling, Illinois
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~OK, it was good pizza. Was it great pizza? Not at all. I'm not even a New Yorker, a Chicagoan or any other elitist pizza native. It was pizza. Crust was fine -- but not particularly great; sauce was tasty, but nothing to remember; toppings were pretty standard (could the mushrooms have been canned). In fact the pizza needed a little salt just to bring out the flavors.   I know that Pizzeria Regina gets great reviews, but there must be something I missed.~drosen85~Burlingame, California
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best. Very delicious food , good customer service and cozy place. I really enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Definitely I will visit it again~HMZainal~Manama, Bahrain
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Pizza is nice, but not something worth waiting in line for 25 minutes. I had the "everything" pie, and it was a bit too greasy.~gardenofwine~USA
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Pizza is really GREAT !!!! the place is a legitimate Boston landmark. The place keeps the old air at it's original place. They have a line outside of the restaurant ( i went sunday at 5:30pm and wait about 20 min, outside - look out when the rain ou cold is a trouble). they have anothes places in town but don't miss this place.~Leonardo_g_Rangel~Salvador, BA
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The crust, sauce, and cheese are all Grade A perfection!  There's lots of seating, and they have a bathroom too.  ~expat_mbk~USA
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The reviews led me here. On the street was a line a block long, suggesting I was onto something. A steady stream of to-go orders flowing out added a bit more validation. But then I sat at the bar, ordered a beer and a small pie, and there was no more doubt. Superb pie, impeccably crispy with fantastic cheeses, tomato beautifully seasoned. Don't miss this.~mervadrian~Pleasanton, California
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of the best pizza's we have ever eaten. The staff was friendly and the restaurant small and cozy. Loved the 80's music!  Great vibe. We can't wait to go back!~Bethyangelo~Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the best pizza I've had in a long time. The man who greeted us was a little gruff---he wants you to stand HERE while you wait for your table---but not in a bad way. With the amount of business they do, I think he was just trying to keep it organized. Our waitress was nice and there is a very authentic feel to the place. So glad we got to try it!~ILoveTexas~Argyle, Texas
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This little gem of a pizza place is well worth a visit. There will probably be people queueing to get in but the line moves fast and it's well worth a little wait.~Hannah T~Bury St. Edmunds, United Kingdom
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a great experience.  We stopped in for lunch based on reviews found on line.  Bustling little place that serves pizza and drinks.  The pizza was great, very traditional.  Fun to watch the staff who were like well-oiled machines doing their jobs.  It is clear that this place is a local gem.  Lots of uniformed officers stopping in for lunch or taking out.  It was also apparent that people order 3-8 large pizzas for the business lunches.  Amazing little find.  Loved the experience.  ~Nancy S~Denver, Colorado
Pizzeria Regina~322981~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were on a pizza tour when this pizza was brought to us. This was our second slice out of 3 and my absolute favorite. You gotta try it with the Louie sauce it is absolutely everything! Best pizza ever!!!~lilsnipper102~San Diego, California
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good chinese food with a very nicely decorated interior and exceptionally friendly staff.      Will definitely be back again.~BL_LI~LI, NY
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I will first say that the craftsmanship put into this place is outstanding... a work in progress on the outside BUT A Masterpiece on the Inside... VERY WELL DONE... which makes the dining experience very pleasant.. The service was great... had gotten the dim sum for an app and was delish. I have never had it served the way they do and certainly no complaints about the dish either.  I got the Pad Thai and my friend got the General Tso's chicken... I will say I've had better Pad Thai in other places... it wasn't bad I've just had better... now... the General Tso's chicken... OFF THE HOOK FANTASTIC!!! best I've ever tasted for real. Unbelievable... perfect because I can tell they make it different then anywhere else I've tried it. The only thing I can say disappointing about Plum Blossom is that they should really get a Saki menu. They only have one kind and they serve it hot. You can't get it cold... wait doesn't it come at room temp? Anyway, I love my Saki luckily I was in a warm Saki mood anyway. I would suggest going anyway!!! ENJOY!!!~William O~Albany, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved our lunch, staff very nice, however no one at the door so we stood there awhile until someone greeted us to take us to a table and we would return.~2013TravelinFool~Yuma, Arizona
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My daughter and I found this lovely Asian restaurant on route 7 going east out of Troy. The lo mein noodles were fabulous: tasty, complex, good portion size.  Many of the items were not quite like "every other Asian-American place;" the gyoza and the shumai dumplings had not-quite familiar fillings, but variety is nice!  The dining room is gorgeous; surfaces are ornate with varieties of artistic wood surfaces and sculptures and artwork. Go just to be impressed by the walls and ceiling!~Erica T~West Chester, United States
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My nephew, who attended RPI, told me about this place.  He said his parents would always book a reservation here when they came to visit him at school.  It's a big place, so they often have reservation slots available. But definitely make a reservation if it's a big weekend at RPI, you'll wait a long time if you just stop in.  Typical Chinese fare, nothing very special about the menu, but that makes is a good choice for a crowd.  Plenty to choose from.~12RAS302~Albany, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nothing much really from the outside, this is a wonderful place for Chinese food in Troy, NY.  The inside decor is very nice, the service is courteous and the food is delicious and well priced.  My adult kids and I have eaten here a half dozen times in the past 6 months and have never been disappointed.  We've also had a few to-go orders which were the best from the area.   Highly recommended.~agarneau~Albany, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Passed this place many times because of something I had to do in Albany, finally stopped there for lunch on the last day. Wish we had discovered it earlier. The food was excellent, and I mean really top-notch Chinese food. Had the General Tso's chicken and hot and sour soup - both great. My wife had a dish whose name I can't recall but it was basically shrimp over spinach noodles with a lemony-cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious. Portions were large enough that we each took some home and I think they were both priced at $8.95 for lunch. Only problem - we had to wait FOREVER for the check after we had finished eating, which is really a pet peeve of mine; otherwise I'd have given it a "5" rating (there were only 2 servers for what looked to be at least 12 tables worth of diners).~Bill S~Jacksonville, Vermont
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The first thing I noticed walking into the Plum Blossom was the very attractive ambience. Lots of woodwork. Very appealing. Although much of the Plum Blossom's menu is standard fare,  they also have items on it I haven't seen elsewhere. I had a beef dish that came with a fruity curry sauce. A friend had an item called Singapore Street Noodles(very tasty); and another friend had an appealing dish of shrimp and noodles in a coconut cream sauce. While I have been to better Chinese restaurants, I would certainly rate the Plum Blossom as a place worth repeated visits.~Beeper99_12~Hudson, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is delicious and made even better by the atmosphere! Friendly and prompt service. The prices are a little higher than your typical Chinese restaurant, but the portion sizes and flavor more than makes up for the increase. ~mynes001~Troy, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is great!  And the hand carved woodwork makes for a great atmosphere.  It is elegant but you don't have to dress elegant.  Cocktails available.  Ample parking.~Kathleen A H~Troy, United States
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The interior is beautiful and makes for a very elegant and pretty ambiance. The service is very slow. If we order three dishes we will get them at three different times, often served cold. Waiting times to get a table are long too. We used to go there often but hadly do so anymore because of the incredibly  slow service.~Nele73~New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a traditional Chinese restaurant beautifully decorated. Center of the main dining room has 2 exquisitely carved wooden vases & other Oriental accessories. Add white table cloths on tables & a pot of tea! Food is well prepared & delicious! Nice menu. Good for whole family & eat with chopsticks for fun!~cookiegran~North Naples, Florida
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Typical Chinese food, nothing special. The waitstaff were friendly but didn't check on us enough. I had egg foo young and they make it without bean sprouts and put a brown gravy on it. It seemed freshly prepared but not much flavor. The sweet and sour chicken was heavy breaded and deep fried too greasy for our taste. Anyway, not bad but nothing noteworthy either.~karen m~Desert Hot Springs, California
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very efficient service. Excellent food. Atmosphere inviting. Good place to bring family and friends for a special occasion.~Gail R~Troy, New York
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a wonderful dinner that was hot and fresh at the Plum Blossom. The menu has a wonderful variety and the atmosphere is soothing. Along with all of these attributes the interior is beautiful and comfortable.  A nice place for dinner!~Thea M~Cody, Wyoming, United States
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped to eat at Plum Blossom as we were driving through. We were expecting just a small little strip mall Chinese restaurant, and we're pleasantly surprised. When we arrived there were quite a bit of people waiting in the front entrance to be sat and to pick up to go orders, but we were brought to a table very quickly. The service wasn't the quickest, but when you are seated you are brought hot tea and fried wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard sauce for dipping. This helped hold us over, we were starving.  The menu offers a great variety of vegetarian options, as well as all the traditional items. The food was great, and the serving sizes are quite large. ~Kristen R~Denver, Colorado
Plum Blossom~420160~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited this restaurant with friends who live nearby and who have eaten here before. They suggested it for dinner. We shared. The pupu platter which had egg rolls, skewered chicken & pork, tempura shrimp, BBQ spare ribs. It was just ok nothing special. My combination platter of pepper steak, fried rice and egg roll was average. My husband enjoyed his shrimp Kung Pao spicy dish. Our friends said their food was very good. I found the prices to be high compared to the quality and size of the portions. The waitress was pleasant but not overly attentive. I thought that being a sit down Chinese restaurant we would be served ice cream or fruit for dessert but I was sadly disappointed. Oh, well I can tell you that the room is very pretty. ~veteran11~Delray Beach, Florida
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything was delicious. The service was great.  What else can you say.  I had the Calzone and loved every bite.  I cannot recommend Pomo's any higher.  A must stop when in Phoenix. ~Robert S~Mattoon, Illinois
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent, authentic Italian pizza!  All the ingredients are fresh and very tasty!!!  Very attentive and fast service!~Christy W~Phoenix, Arizona, United States
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great atmosphere. In the heart of the city. Parking is not as bad at it may seem. Great wine list. Attentive staff. Pizzas are great.~jyotsnadietrich~Phoenix, Arizona
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I go here and sit at the counter by where they prepare the pizza for the wood fired oven.  The pizza is innovative.  ~krwhite2016~Phoenix, Arizona
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I moved from Boston to Phoenix.  I sometimes feel I am on the eternal quest to find the best pizza.  I finally found it at Pomo.  Love the pizza, love the staff and love the atmosphere.  It is our go-to for a date night.~Jeanmarie J~Phoenix
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In town for business. Was looking for something not too fancy. Found this place and let me tell you this is the BEST PIZZA i have had in a LONG TIME. would highly recommend this place. Owner actually serves COMPLEMENTARY SHOTS at the end of your dinner. Awesome food and awesome service..!!~MikeP1982~Red River, New Mexico
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Let's face it, if you go to a pizzeria you're probably going to enjoy a pizza.  I've been to the Pomo in Scottsdale before and thoroughly enjoyed their pizza.  So i figured i would give a try to something new and picked the Lasagna.  The lasagna is not up to par with the pizzas served at Pomo.  It looked almost nuked with it's appearance, which it wasn't, but the flavors just weren't there for me....just get the pizza and make yourself happy :)  So why 4 stars??!!  Well i went here with my buddies and throughly enjoyed the cocktails and the atmosphere.  Love the red bricks all along the dining room area and just a great relaxed feel overall.  The highlight of the night was having the owner come and pour us a couple shots of the house made limoncello.  NOW THAT WAS AMAZING!!  The limoncello was so creamy and went down so easy, you could easily have 4 shots of those before debating having shot 5 and 6.  :)  There was no special occasion that we mentioned to the restaurant, just the owner coming to thank us for coming in and pouring us some delicious shots.  Definitely worth going back.~PhoenixRising7~Phoenix, Arizona, United States
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza and bruchetta were great. The tiramisu and cannolli were both yummy. We will definitely go back when we are through Phoenix again ~Leah F~Hillsboro, Texas
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is pizza the way it supposed to be made.  Crisp outer crust.  Soft inner dough Flavorful but not overpowering sauce.  Toppings that add to not bleach out other flavored.  All cooked in a pizza oven not only bought in Italy but assembled by an Italian.  Cooked over high heat (+1000 degrees) this pizza IS the real deal.  Try the caprese salad too. Fresh, delicate mozzarella with crisp tomato and basil.  Add great service and you will be delighted.  ~OrmondBeachFL~Florida
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is true Neapolitan pizza..the service is great and there is a large variety of pizza toppings..worth the trip~Rosepasco~USA
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was recommended by some friends.  Wow were they right on the food and the drinks! Not quite as good as we have had in Italy but the closest thing we have found so far in Phoenix. The Aperol spritz were on point, the Capricciosa pizza was just like the one I enjoyed so much in Roma, wood fire taste and all. Prices are reasonable, service is top notch, & the Creme Brule is to die for. At the end of your meal you get a special treat of a shot of creamy lemoncello. OMG I forgot how good that stuff is! If you're in the neighborhood you must stop by. I for one will definitely be a return customer. ~Wil L~Goodyear, Arizona
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came for lunch to this Italian restaurant downtown Phoenix.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  All food and drinks tasted excellent. Pizza, pasta and dessert which was offered even for free were outstanding and 100% authentic.  The owner himself offered two shots of Limoncello before we had to go.  If we would live here this place would be one of our favorites.~FrankGeisler~Zurich, Switzerland
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were staying with our so and he and his wife highly recommended we eat here and we are so glad we did. We actually ordered for take out but enjoyed an appetizer and drinks while we waited. We had a couple pizzas & appetizers and the wait was only about 15 minutes.   Our bartender was amazing and the staff all seemed to be having fun while working hard when ergot back to our sons, we all agreed the food was 5 stars!  We'll be back in October and this is one we will certainly return to. You can't go wrong!~Bonnie V~Poynette, Wisconsin
Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana - Phoenix~4308922~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went on my own and sat at the bar.  The food is incredible, every review is bang on.  I had a buffalo mozzarella salad and caprese (swapped the salami for a spicy one) and the espresso on ice cream.  All perfect.  The chap at the bar was nice company and very attentive too.  Great place.  Nice atmosphere too.  V relaxed. ~RKJP~England
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing margaritas...best in this Northwest town in my book!:)  the Sangria is amazing as well. This is a great place for a vegan... get the Bryans bowl vegan with tortillas and you will NOT be sorry! So fresh, so tasty, so filling! I love guacamole here as well... fresh and yummy!!~44bambi44~Portland, Oregon
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had fish tacos and enjoyed them. I just wasn't wowed. I did very much enjoy the ambience of the place. It was nice to be able to sit outside. For us, arriving 930 at night, there wasn't much of a wait at all. The service was very friendly.~Ellie B~Providence, Rhode Island
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've eaten here a couple times because it is close to my house and decent Mexican food.  However, it does not live up to its hype and is not worth the wait unless you really have nothing better to do than stand in a queue for an hour on a sidewalk. Some people seem to believe that the line up is proof that they must have excellent food. However, just because more people eat at McDonalds than any other burger place in the world doesn't mean they have the best burgers. PQN is a bit of a Portland institution so if you want to do all the things that most tourists to SE Portland do, then by all means come here, wait in line and convince yourself that it was worth it. For some people it probably is. The point is that there are little known Mexican places with food and/or margaritas just as good and better that are waiting to be discovered. So be bold. Buck the trend. Go where no hipster has gone before. Seek out the next great little Mexican place and then tell your friends about it. Por que no?~Portlandio~Portland, Oregon
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It might be a bit hyped but it's really really good. Everything I tried was phenomenal and I left very happy. From the guacamole and pico de gallo to tacos to tortillas to sangrias were all very good. Keep up the good work. ~Anne T~Vancouver, Canada
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My first visit to Porque No. The gazpacho soup special was a dark peppery broth, flavorless, sprinkled with chopped cabbage, peppers and other ill-defined veggies. NOT what I call gazpacho! Not knowing the size of their Tacos, I ordered one Carnitas taco. Out came a soft palm-sized Taco with a sprinkle of pork, salsa Verde, onions, cilantro & queso fresco. Basically one mouthful bite. NOT the taco I had visualized. No Dos Equis, so I ordered their Michelada of Tecate, lime juice & Worcestershire sauce. Tasted like lemon juice, and I don't mean lemonade.  All in all not a great first visit. I will order differently next time. ~DrT4709~Atlanta, Georgia
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Por Que Non? has 3 outlets in Portland. How lucky can one Pacific Northwest town be? Simply, this tacoria is really good. Por Que No? is well run, the food is really tasty w/ good portions and if you can avoid the lines, you'll get a choice table.  Also, as a pescatarian, I have never seen 3 seafood tacos on any menu - fish, calamari and prawn -- usually it's one of the three. Plus, you can taste the frescas if you cannot make up your mind. This is one customer focused Mexican eatery.~HaljoHal~San Francisco, California, USA
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tempted by good TripAdvisor rating we took off to East Portland on 14 bus from  city centre (it goes up Main to Broadway then back down Madison) and great to see this buzzing part of Portland and to taste brilliant inexpensive tacos with excellent margarita and draft beers in chilled atmosphere with efficient friendly service.Highly recommended.~zztupper~oxford
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The line looks long but its worth the wait (the line moves quickly). I got two tacos as well as chips and guac and it was all very tasty! Definitely worth the stop.~Kathleen W~Cambridge, Massachusetts
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is in a fun district to visit. Lots of shopping and other restaurants to try. Food was good. Shrimp taco and pollo verde taco were flavorful. Fish  taco was relatively bland in my opinion but husband liked it. Steak tacos were tasty. Sangria was average and margarita was less than average. ~repke95~Seattle, Washington
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unless you arrive at a weird time, you will absolutely have to wait. However, you won't be disappointed. For a city with, overall, middling Mexican options, this place is excellent. The tacos are cheap, delicious, and reasonably sized. It's a great location, although a little hole-in-the-wall-y.~Nick W~Portland, Oregon
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went ealry for dinner and just beat the line of customers. You have to order first before getting a table. I had the Carnitas Flautas which were fantastic. Great selection of hot sauces and great Margaritas. Good selection of beers. friendly staff. Parking is on the street and can be hard to get close. to the taquiaria.~sushiboy202~Palm Desert, California
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You will stand in line at this small open front restaurant but there's sidewalk chalk to help you pass the time.  The decor is very klitsy Latin but very fun!  You order at the counter and there is seating both inside and outside in the back.  A rainbow of large glass jars with Sangria and other fresh made delicious drinks line the counter and are ladled into glasses upon ordering.  The Sangria comes beautifully full of fruit and has quite a "punch". The tacos are fresh, the meat tender and spicy, the guacamole smooth and the home made chips crispy. Would definitely eat here more often if we lived in Portland!~Trave2leverywhere~Raleigh, North Carolina
Por Que No~1155617~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~sooooo worth the effort if you like good Mexican tacos.  Yes there was a line but it moved quickly.  There were five adults in our party.  We each had something different and each raved about how good our tacos were.  We also had marguaritas and they were good too!!~JRottie~Bend, Oregon
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A great restaurant that is looking a little ragged. The food is still great, but when you pay $$$ for a fancy buffet and they don't provide spoons, you gotta start wondering. The tables were packed so closely you had to fight your way thru to the food line is a joke. Too bad it looks like the are scrimping to me.~ebcnaz~Seattle, Washington
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best view in Portland! We picked a seat right by the window and had a gorgeous view of downtown and all the bridges that cross into the city. Food was amazing and at a super good price. We went for happy hour and we got a few appetizers for an amazing deal. I expected this place to be super pricey and upscale since it is located in downtown and at the top of a building; but I was surprised that everything was super affordable.  ***Tip: They validate parking, so make sure you bring your ticket! And go early for happy hour. Seating is first come, first serve so you might have to wait for an open table. But in the meantime you're welcome to grab drinks at the bar while you wait! :)~Christine N~Ubud, Indonesia
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Got a tip about this place from a friendly local. The views were great. On the expensive side but a delicious meal. Service was top notch.  You'll definitely need reservations for a window spot. ~ceceliainDC~Washington DC
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Got there around 4:20 PM, just opened, the place and open seating was packed. It explained why we had to wait a while befor our appetizers arrived. They were so delicious and simply so tasty that we ordered even more.~Hossien E~Corvallis, Oregon
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place, great view, great food! It is really expensive but it is worth paying for it. Would go back again.~Franfort~Namur, Belgium
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the NY strip loin dip that was just ok for me, this seems like an overall average place for lunch and I probably wouldn't chose to eat here again as there are so many other places surrounding the area that I would rather try:) The views though are amazing, so if that's important you should definitely check this place out. We also came here for happy hour and I have to say I was happier with that experience. We had multiple appetizers: Kung Pao Calimari - very tasty but also very chewy, crab and Avocado Roll - my co-worker inhaled these so we had to order a second plate, Poblano Mac & Cheese - I loved this, Asian Spring Rolls - This was not a hit at all, the peanut sauce was very tasty but the rolls were not~annathorell~San Jose, CA
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you have anyone coming out of town for a visit and they want to see Portland, this is the place to take them!  The restaurant sits high above the US Bank tower and the views are breath-taking.  I've only been to the bar side because they have one of the best happy hours in my opinion.   Happy hour runs Monday thru Saturday from 4pm to 7pm and then again 9pm to close.  Sundays it's noon to close. You can choose from a mix of American or Asian cuisine.  Some of my favorites are the Poblano Mac & Cheese, Kung Pao Calamari, Spicy Chili-garlic Pork Riblets and Grilled Steak House Cheeseburger.  Prices for food range from $4.95 to $10.95.  They also have drink specials as well.  Sometimes they have a piano player which adds to the atomophere.  For those who go frequent they now offer a rewards card where you recieved points for dining there and then can be easily redeemed towards food.  They do have parking in the building and will validate your parking for you making it free.  The wait staff is a little slow at times and the place can get very crowded.  Seating in the bar is first come first serve and the place does get busy.  There are booths all along the perimeter, but the coveted spots are the ones right by the big windows with city views.  There is also seating around the piano as well as at the bar in the middle of the room.  Of course you can always make reservations in the dining room as well, however prices are a little more.~Mia P~Vancouver, Washington
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recommended by our hotel receptionist, the Portland City Grill gave us one of the most memorable evenings of our three week holiday on the West Coast. It was not just the unique cocktails on arrival or the wonderful food but also the view that transformed as day gave way to dusk.  I am delighted that my request for a window table could be accommodated but with hindsight I should have booked in advance. Being located on the 30th. floor guarantees that the window tables are the most popular but the layout of the restaurant means that everybody can experience the view.~PaPopHall~Faversham, United Kingdom
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a very nice steak-house located on the 30th floor with good views of Portland. Service is very good & knowledgeable. Good menu and excellent quality of food. Quite expensive but worth it. You can not book the tables by the window but request/wait upon arrival.~saltacity~Weinheim, Germany
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This spot is quite the spot.  Bar was noisy when we popped in after theater performance (around 10:30 pm) so we opted for the restaurant.  They still seated us right next to the bar, but we were shielded by some furniture so it worked out OK. The view is amazing... all the bridges and waterways stretch out before you.  Service was top notch.  Food matched the waiter's care & enthusiasm.  We ordered some Asian veggie rolls & a chicken dish (can't remember it's name).  Both were EXCELLENT.  Then we shared a dessert ~ chocolate type cake which was incredible.  We WILL be back.  Next time I think we'll try their Sunday brunch.   Highly recommend... just be aware it could be noisy just about anytime you show up. Oh, and remember there IS PARKING IN THE BUILDING below their 30th floor 'nest.'  Very handy- and they validate parking fee.~Gloria L~Washougal, Washington
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited the Bar at Portland City Grill. Most people will make reservations for dinner or try to get in early for a seat at the Bar.  We were fortunate we got a window seat in the Bar area.  Our waitress was very attentive and took care of us immediately.  The martini's were fantastic, bar tender was super.   We shared some appetizer's and split a meal. The Crab Cakes are the best ever here. Will get those always from now on. The view is one of best in the City especially at night. You see all the lights of the city, along with the bridges in the area. Superb place to bring friends or meet colleagues. Priced at the higher end. You can get away with ordering one dinner for 2 as the meals are large here.  Great bar with live piano music!! Will make it a go to from now on!~Yolanda999~Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wanting a quiet evening with great food, good conversation, and a magnificent view of the city of Portland, OR we chose the Portland City Grill.  The restaurant is on the 30th floor of the Bancorp Building and has a birds eye view of the Willamette River and surrounding downtown Portland area.  We arrived and ordered drinks from a more than abundant wine and liquor menu.  Customer service was excellent and friendly from the moment we arrived throughout the evening.  Food was chef prepared and mouth watering.  Steaks are top notch with seafood also in rare form.  The price was on the moderate plus side and worth the expense.    Please visit and enjoy the view, food, company, and atmosphere.  You will not regret it.  ~oregonwanderers2016~Canyon City, Oregon
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on a beautiful weekday evening and had a very good time. The rice roll appetizer was awesome. My steak was not cooked right, and we did feel a little rushed. However, a positive experience. ~Uccman39~Howell, New Jersey
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to grill for birthday lunch. A beautiful table by the window on a crystal clear day.  Waiter walked over and sprinkled Happy Birthday all over the table. Bloody Mary was prefect and remembered the green olives. Lamb burger cooked perfectly! French fries could have been hotter but I am kind weird about that.  My friends had clam chowder and steak sandwiches which said they were to good they couldn't share. Really enjoyed out lunch!~dancingsoccermom~Mountain Home, Idaho
Portland City Grill~487540~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a treat to have happy hour from this view.  We were lucky to find seating right next to the window and the view was incredible.  Enjoyed the macaroni and cheese, caesar salad and oven roasted salmon cakes with a Perfect Pink Margarita.~gardenrose15~Glastonbury, Connecticut
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beautiful restaurant, nice crowd.  We picked this out of zagat.  The decor is beautiful, the service excellent, and the food was just perfect.  We will be back. I have to say this place is perfect!! The only thing they can do to make this better, is to have a singer or a piano player.  We go out a lot, this was a true gem!~makeup1031~Staten Island, New York
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came upon the place after a dead car battery caused us to miss our dinner reservation in Manhattan. In Jersey City for a show we came in for dinner. Sat at the bar, great martini (Gibson) to start! Lamb chops were delicious and the Nebbiolo was perfect alongside. Even treated ourselves to dessert & a Tawny port, we'd definitely go back if we're in Jersey City again!~rapskp~Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Elegant ambience.  Well-trained servers.  Beautifully-presented meals.  A class establishment !  Conveniently located downtown.~Hope Susan B~Jersey City, NJ, USA
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a business lunch, the food and service was great.  Fresh food, with a nice ambiance.  Would recommend for power lunch or romantic dinner. Service was outstanding.  Will be visiting on a regular basis.~NJTraveler35_9~Franklin Lakes NJ
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have had dinner here 5 or 6 times and the pasta and fish are perfectly turned out; the wait staff are attentive without hovering and dinner is a positive pleasure.~scfernandez~North Saanich, Canada
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been here with friends and also to host a business guest - I have ordered Halibut every time and I crave for that taste. It is simply amazing - highly recommend the place.~gsaurabh84~Jersey Shore, New Jersey
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten here several times, and allways been satisfied, last night was no exception. Portobello Mushrooms stuffed with Italian Sausage was just heavenly, so was the vealfilled pasta with a thick tomato reduction I had as a second serving. The staff is allways friendly. And the price is great for a restaurant of this quality~Jarle R C~Oslo, Norway
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I made a reservation for my husband's business dinner.  I requested a table a bit off to the side and mentioned that his group was having a celebratory dinner.  When he arrived with his group, they were seated at a perfect table in the corner, but with all the ambience of the restaurant before them.  The service was impressive and apparently the Scallops were amazing, as I am still hearing about both!  One of the guys in the group cancelled his reservation at another restaurant in Jersey City for the following night in order to celebrate his girlfriend's birthday at Porto Legerro.~Kate F~westfield, United States
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family loves this place, and every time we're in the area we stop by.    The place is nice, old-school Italian with a nice extensive menu.   Their 'specialty' is that they have 2 sides of the menu, preparing essentially the same dish in Northern and Southern Italian style.~ddiddo~Nairobi, Kenya
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Outstanding wine, calamari was superb and swordfish exceeded expectations. The service was outstanding, don't miss this restaurant for business dining and special occasions~sib715~University Park, Florida
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There  wasn't one aspect of this dinner that wasn't perfect.  Ok, there was one.....I was not given the dish that I ordered.  HOWEVER, they were right on top of it immediately and remedy the issue with grace and apologies. Every morsel of food was just delicious. The maitre D'  could not have be more attentive to every facet of every patron. He was right on top of everything.  They did not bother us when we were there for 3 hours.  We were neither rushed nor made to feel we needed to vacate the table.  This is not an inexpensive dinner, but so worth every penny!!~PerfectIslands~New York
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There wasn't a spot left on our dishes, amazing cuisine!  Chef Angelo is truly gifted in his creations!~1Danya~Jersey City, New Jersey
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Three of us had dinner here recently for the first time and the experience was excellent.  The greeting was quick and warm and we were taken to our table right away, although we were a bit early for our reservation. The menu is mostly northern Italian/Mediterranean with a good selection and many specials offered and the food was very good--equal to many Manhattan restaurants. The wine list is comprehensive with wines from many regions and moderate prices.  Service was top notch and the pace of the meal was just right.  The restaurant also has very nice decor and we were able to carry on a normal conversation which was another plus. Parking is available on the street right in front of the restaurant which is very convenient and free--not even meters to feed.~JohnTampaBay~St. Petersburg, Florida
Porto Leggero~1119688~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to Porto Leggero last for dinner.  Spectacular!  What a wine list and Elliot really knows his Italian wines.  Not many places have the 2006 Bertani Amarone around here, but Porto Leggero did.  And the food was phenomenal.   Haven't had Italian food like that for a long time.  Coupled with the service and great friends, it was a perfect evening.   Elliot:  we'll be back! Ray G~raygogel~Toronto, Canada
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As with some of these restaurants the music was to loud.  The food was good but a bit pricey. We had a Cheese Board starter and that was good.  The bruschetta was excellent. The self parking was a nightmare, but they do offer valet parking.~happyholiday347~Phoenix, Arizona
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great selection of wines and beers!  Went with friends for a drink and appetizers.  The bruschetta was incredible!!!  There is valet parking and while the place seems small there was plenty of seating.~Hilary G~Tucson, Arizona
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had appetizers and tea here one day in the early afternoon, after the lunch rush. Appetizers were great, service was good outdoor dining was lovely. Parking was a bit funky with a sign out front that says not to enter but you have to drive past it to get to the self parking area. My friend mistook it to mean no entry at all and had to use valet as a result. Not a big deal though. Overall, it was a lovely stop.~Mia H~Gilbert, Arizona
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had lunch. service was outstanding. Our waiter took the time to explain the menu and make suggestions. I started with a leak soup. We then each got the bruschetta. The dish allows for four choices. So we had eight selections. Each is cut into four. So we tasted many on the list. All were very good. Favorite was Brie with apples and fig. ~Phil G~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited Postino's in Scottsdale last Friday night for wine and a sandwich.  I ordered a panini so big I had to take half home.  It was delicious.  They have a very nice wine menu including an Arizona white wine which I enjoyed.  Meals were priced reasonable.  Wine was a bit on the high priced side for a glass.  ~icegrams~Scottsdale
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It has to have a great wine list (and craft beer draft list) and plates of cheese, olives and deli meats. The butchers block (no explanation needed) fills my wants. The bruschetta plates (choice of 4 from a long list) for about $14 fills the wants of the non butcher block guests. Other items on the menu helps the others. Very high on my list of choices. Hits the spot for me. ~themccullochclan~Indio, California
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love the gluten-free bread. My husband who is not GF also thought it was delicious. We had 8 selections of bruschetta to split and each one was outstanding. Before 5 pm, all wines or a pitcher of any beer are only $5 each. We ate at the Scottsdale location for lunch on Sunday and then at the Phoenix central location on Tuesday night -- it was that good. At the central location, we had the butcher board and the vegetable board. They were also good, but the bruschetta is what would have me coming back. Service is also friendly and attentive. If you ever expand out of AZ, come to Austin, TX!! ~texasgal1010~Corpus Christi, Texas
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband, sister and I recently tried Postino Winebar on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was busy, but we were readily seated.  They have special on Mimosa or Bellini for $5, so I tried a Mimosa with fresh squeezed AZ orange juice. It was refreshing.  We started with the Cheese Board which is an assortment of cheeses, fruits and toasted bread, all which was tasty.  They have many Gluten Free Options, which I enjoyed.  My sister and I enjoyed the half of Panini (available on GF Bread for $2 more) and 1/2 a salad.  I had the chicken & Mozzarella Panini which was delightful, and the Brussel Sprout s Salad which was fresh and full of delightful tastes.  My sister and husband also enjoyed their selections.  Believe that we will definitely be back!~SueTurf~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I stopped in one afternoon after shopping and sightseeing. We love it if we can find a wine bar when traveling. we had a couple of glasses of wine each - very nice variety and our server was helpful with selections. We also had two appetizers - the Butcher Block which had a nice variety of meats and cheeses, and the Pub Board which contained soft pretzels that were warm and so good.~SmokiesJunkie~Fishers, Indiana
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Postino has a good selection of appetizers, soups, salads and paninis.  I've had the Tuscan Tuna panini which was very good.  But, honestly, I usually don't get past the bruschetta on their menu.  That's the reason I go there.  They serve a board with 4 large bruschetta.  Believe me, they are so big that you will need to share.  I've tried all of them.  My favorites are the smoked salmon with pesto, the goat cheese with spicy jam, the brie and apple, the artichoke spread and the bacon, burrata, arugula and tomato.  They have good wines that pair well with the food on their menu, so they have everything I need for a good lunch or dinner with my husband or one of my friends.  The atmosphere is relaxed but can be a little noisy and the service a little slow when they are crowded, which is most of the time. I come to relax, so the slow service doesn't usually bother me if I have my glass of wine and good conversation.  This is one of my go to places when I'm in the Arcadia area.~Andrea B~Mesa, Arizona
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Started with the bruschetta my favorite was the apple, Brie, and fig. We also tried the soft pretzel board another good choice. Food was well prepared and excellent.~Dave R~Clayotn, OH
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in with several relatives and we were seated quickly and treated pleasantly. My "9 Iron" focaccia was very tasty. ~Scuffy13~Indianapolis, Indiana
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a cool and hip place to meet friends and chill. Not to mention drink wine and have a laugh.  .Outside seating is always comfortable, climate enhanced year round with heaters or misters and the Original music mix keeps the mood just right. Postino has several locations around the Valley. They all boast the same menu so you'll never be disappointed or left missing your favorite. No real "MEALS" here, mostly nosh to enjoy with your wine. That's usually plenty too! Every day they offer $5 for any glass of wine and the Monday Tuesday night "Wine & Board" special is not to be missed! $20 for any bottle off their generous wine list and a wooden board covered by four bruschetta, your choice of 12 toppings...mix n match.  Friendly service and attention to detail make this a hit every time! ~Kittie K~Phoenix, Arizona
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is an old post office made into a cozy wine bar and restaurant. The patio is wonderful most of the year. The wine is only $5 a glass until 5pm. Bruschetta is delicious & you have a choice of 4 which is enough for 2 to 4 people. The shopping across the parking lot is great!~DESUL~Gold Canyon, Arizona
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a oasis from the soulless, franchises you find in the malls.   Postino has real personality, great food and a good drink selection.   Grab a seat outside, chillout and soak up the casual ambience.~Mich G~Melbourne Australia
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wonderful outdoor atmosphere, went to grab a quick bite after a flight. Great wine and beer selection. Delicious bruschetta, great cheese board. Attentive staff. Would definitely go again and will recommend! ~ash6272~Bryant, Arkansas
Postino Winebar~338188~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You just have to come to a Postino location for the bruschetta!  This location was beautiful as we sat outside on the covered patio one evening for dinner.  We shared the bruschetta, which is 4 different slices of bread, each with different toppings.  Each piece is cut into 4 slices.  The 4 flavors we chose were brie, apples and fig spread.  Fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil.  Then sweet and spicy pepper jam with goat cheese and finally ricotta with dates and pistachios.  All of them were wonderful.  My husband also ordered the olive appetizer for $6.75.  And we also split a tasty salad that included quinoa.  Service was great and we definitely will return.  The only problem at this location is the parking.~dshendri~Indianapolis, Indiana
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A review of an upper tier restaurant dining experience is best considered in its parts- and each should be exceptional to attain a 5 star rating. After all, you will be parting with quite a bit of your hard earned cash, and it seems only reasonable to give the dining experience as much consideration as you might use for other purchases.   Lets dispense with price at the outset. The eatery is expensive. You are paying for a breadth of esoteric ingredients artfully arranged in edible form with some imagination and presentation. You are embarking on an entertainment experience for your mind and taste buds. So this does not come cheap. But is it worth it you may ask- well the honest answer is yes and no. Was I blown away by a meal that (without wine pairings) will run about $300 a head? No. Did I appreciate the culinary experience - yes.   In fact there were some hits and misses in the Chefs Tasting menu. I guess that's to be expected as not all perceive each dish the same. There were some standouts, but frankly not enough to give a raving review.   One thing was apparent. The service was professional, but cold. The best word to describe it is "efficient". All performed their roles in an automaton kind of way. No excitement or energy. A description of each dish was as if read from a scorecard without inflection, information, excitement or range. There was nothing wrong about it , but nothing right about it either. Some explanation and insight into the sourcing of ingredients, reason for their selection, etc etc seems warranted in a meal of such expense and calibre but this was entirely lacking. One could not help but notice that the restaurant was a special occasion destination for those celebrating a birthday, anniversary, and the like. These are "warm" events which seemed to contrast greatly with the steel-like coldness of the surround. Just an observation I guess.   When all is taken into consideration I am not at all unhappy I went, and appreciated the chefs efforts. For me it was a 4/5.   ~Gizm0guy~north carolina
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After hearing for ages that this is the #1 spot in LA for fine dining, I finally made it on 9/16/16 for lunch.  They have a lunch offering right now only on Fridays, and you can do a la carte or a tasting menu.   I choose the a la carte.   What the menu doesn't reveal and to my delight, they have several special treats they bring out before your actual meal.  My guess is that this changes over time, but here is what they served (will describe to the best of my memory).   PS - don't read further if you want to be surprised.   I personally loved the surprise of it! ______________________________________________  1. a single frozen red grape infused with liquor on a small bed of ice.   DIVINE     2. passionfruit jelly (looked like an egg yolk)  with seeds that you sip  DIVINE 3. scallop taco.  Tiny scallop and seasonings put into lettuce the shape of a mini taco and then fit into what looked like a napkin holder to keep it all together  DIVINE 4.oyster cracker stuffed with salmon DIVINE 5. melon soup in a shot glass   DIVINE 6. choice of breads (seaweed foccacia, popper loaf, white roll) served with homemade butter and sea salt (and a tiny hockey stick to scoop the salt).  The seaweed one was my favorite  For my meal, I went with the wagyu.  There is a 3 oz minimum ($30/oz), and I found 4 oz to be perfect.  My meat was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I ate it how the chef recommended it be cooked (which I think was medium).  I added a bibb salad (lettuce mixed with vinagrette, shaved carrots and radishes) and a side of vegetables as the meat comes with some vegetables but not a lot.  While I have had wagyu before, this was the best ever.     I was going to get the Japanese dessert on their menu which I was told is their most popular; however, they didn't have it so I went with the chocolate panna cotta which had figs that are grown on the exterior of their building.   It was delicious.  Then they brought out more treats - a dish with a macaroon, lychee jelly and some chocolate.  Finally as a farewell, they give a bag with a pecan roll wrapped up.  The service was the right balance of friendly, helpful and attentive.     NOTE: if you come for dinner, a la carte is only available at the bar.~Dlbos~Boston, Massachusetts
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a reservation, however my friend and I arrived here about 20 minutes late and sadly we where sat at the bar. Since according we lost our "reservation" nonetheless, one of the staff members went all the way and got us a table within 10 minutes after our first course was served.   The location is a bit far away from all the WeHo scene. small location, nice sea decoration, intimate quiet and cozy. My friend and I decided to do the 10 course tasting of which it's more then 10 after all the freebies you get before, mid and after your main courses.  This place mostly serves seafood, the food is good and the presentation is memorable.  the Overall experience  was great and the service was up to par, the food as mentioned is good but nothing mind-blowing that makes me want to go back for more and more. aside from that the price tag can be heavy after drinks and stuff.  haha~sam2066~Los Angeles, California
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love everything and I enjoy.Vey good food. small dishes but worth it.Service fast and knd. the quality of food. very good specially the Lobster.~Jenstebbs~Canada
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My Partner and I love to come to Providence at Least once a year. It's amazing! The food is so special, I mean, a surprise appetizer which is a tiny little peachy colored ball, that u pop in your mouth and it bursts with indescribable yummy flavor?? So unique and wonderful. It's pricey, so it's a treat for us as I mentioned, but we are never disappointed!~kateycat2016~Los Angeles, California
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The first thing i asked when we entered the resto was : does Providence belong to the same restaurant group as The Greenhouse in Mayfair, London?  The nice, cozy & intimate ambience plus the menu were similar. Even the style of serving, wherein the waiters intricately & expertly describe each dish ( ex: the butter is from Normandy. And the ingredients are so fresh- organic, from non-commercial, sustainable sources. ) Really reminded me of The Greenhouse.   This place is a must try. The menu is pricey at around $500 for two people ( we had wine too ) but it's a great place to celebrate special occasions like a special date, an important meeting, negotiations that have to be sealed or celebrated, a marriage proposal , and in my case, it was a dinnerdate to celebrate my bday. The menu, the impeccable service, high standards and all, make the price worth it.   A special nite calls for this special dinner menu choice. Everything came in small portions, but so many amuse-bouche that we were so full at the end of my birthday meal. Loved it ! #Providence is owned by Chef Michael Cimarusti. Everything here is sustainable. No commercially farmed meats or veggies, nothing overfished or overharvested. It's a spectacular, gastronomic experience. #happytummies   Book in advance.   ~Christine B~Quezon City, Quezon City, Philippines
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant is full of Asian foreigners who don't know better.  The bill is too expensive, the food is too ordinary, the ambiance is too ugly.  Do I need to say more??~Mary C~California
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of the premiere restaurants in Los Angeles - period.  It is THE seafood restaurant and the other offerings are also as good as it gets.  This is a first class, high end "big city" restaurant the kind you'd expect in the best of New York, Paris, Rome, etc.  You get the picture.  Service staff is the best in town and Denato (co-owner with chef) is the quintessential front man.  He' always smiling, always has a story, makes you feel like his best friend and will always make sure that you're happy.  There's no "get this dish" at Providence.  EVERY DISH is a winner.  Go; spend the money; you won't be sorry.~Richard G~Los Angeles
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a memorable dinner at Providence. We chose the most expensive menu, and even if it was probably the most expensive dinner of my life, I do not regret it! It was simply unbelievable!~jamesgoren~New York NY
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went with a large group, and we had the tasting menu with wine pairing. Alex was really nice in his emails and guaranteed that our night was good. The service was a bit slow at first, but super professional and polite. The food was awesome and the wine pairing was superb. I mean, it was really good wine and it matched really good with all that food. We were all really happy. This restaurant is excellent, especially if you are in the mood for some tasting menu with wine pairing. It is a bit pricy, but it's worth it.~Patynady~Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wife brought me for my birthday and Providence crushed it. We had cocktails from the bar with the chef's tasting menu. Easily in the top 5 meals of my life.~James M~Los Angeles, California
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow... was really impressed! Great ambiance, great food and excellent service! We went for the Chefs Tastig menu and while it was expensive the experience is worth every penny! Recommend especially for a special occasion of sorts! Great experience overall! ~Es25~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Providence~594024~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You are limited to the tasting menus but can embellish them. Our dinner was excellent and innovative. The crab stuffed radish slices were incredibel as was every morsel of our dinners.  Expensive.~traveledfar~Los Angeles, Ca
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Apparently this restaurant books up days in advance so we were delighted to be able to obtain a table for 4 on a recent weeknight without a reservation; they had a no-show. This is a beautiful restaurant and feels very homey and festive. We had a variety or appetizers to share as well as 5 main course dishes to share for the four of us and that was sufficient. Everything was delicious! The sommelier was knowledgeable about the wine list and recommended some wonderful wine to go along with our dinner. The service was excellent although not in your face. We will be back!~ConnoisseurCharlotte~Charlotte
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Back in DC, I was now able to take my wife to Rasika. It's not just the fantastic food (the crispy spinach is not to be missed and the sweet potato samosas are a real treat), I've always been impressed by the service. Everyone I've encountered there has been helpful and made me feel as though they are really pleased that I've come to their restaurant. While it is almost impossible to get a reservation, it's first come, first served for the tables in the bar and outside. It's now getting a little cool for outdoors, but those tables provide great people watching.~david43501~Saint Paul, Minnesota
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fabulous, inventive Indian food in a fun setting.  This restaurant is great for any meal -- but has become my go to for Sunday brunch, when the restaurant is less crowded.  I'm often alone, and find a happy place at the bar, with an attentive bartender who has a great memory.  The mocktails are really tasty.  The menu is really great -- interesting twists on traditional dishes.  While you can find a standard curry, I would encourage branching out -- this is really creative cooking!  Also love the decor -- the wall of spices is a fantastic touch.~aeflow~Washington, DC
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good range of Indian dishes. I was dining alone, so I sat at the bar - very nice modern style. I love Indian food, and this restaurant does it perfectly. Highly recommend them!~WVMargarita~WV
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great restaurant with amazing food.  The palak chaat is so yummy.  I had the lamb kashmiri and my husband had lamb biryani - both were excellent!~via-vacca~Sedgwick, Maine
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was invited to this famous restaurant by serious foodies.  They ordered a series of little plates, which had wonderful unfamiliar flavors.  At Rasika, whatever you order will be a treat to the palate, so don't hesitate to order something unfamiliar.. The food and service were impeccable.  There was enough left over for dinner for two persons.  On the down side, it is difficult to park there at lunchtime.  I would have paid for valet service. The restaurant is also noisy.  It is best to book a booth, if you come with a small group..~lisafrique~Rockville, Maryland
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was very pleased with the apps that we ordered. All were wonderful and the cocktails were also great. A safe place to take a client. ~Ken D~Akron, Ohio
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to the Rasika West End after a show at the Kennedy Center. There were three of us, and while we did have reservations, we opted to forgo those to take three seats at the bar. I like the modern look of the bar, and really enjoyed the energy and advice of the bartender.  I tried a couple of cocktails and enjoyed them all.  What was most memorable for me was the palak chaat. I had never had this dish before; it's made with crispy baby spinach, yogurt, tamarind, and date. For me, it's a craveable--something I definitely want to eat again.  My son tried the Hyderabadi lamb biryani, and it is the benchmark for him now. He's tried many other lamb dishes at other Indian restaurants, and this is definitely the best. My friend, who is vegetarian, had several yummy dishes; and this is one of his favorite restaurants.  You cannot go wrong with any dish on the menu. The two listed above happen to be our favorites.  As for getting to the restaurant, we used the valet parking. I was very thankful for that since it was a rainy summer night in DC.~SCLinSTL~STL
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just fantastic.  I am not a huge Indian food fan. I generally tolerate it rather than enjoy it. Mostly because it is hard to find a quality Indian restaurant. Rasika blew me away. We tried fried spinach as an appetizer. FRIED SPINACH. It was fantastic. The entrees just burst with spice and flavor.   When you first enter, the smells make your stomach growl and you can hardly wait. The staff was great and the food comes quickly. Many times food can be of poor quality when prepared fast, but this is not. It seems as if a genie is waiting for your order so he can prepare the perfect dish in seconds.  I have eaten at many high caliber restaurants and this is easily in my top 5.  It is very popular and reservations are suggested two weeks in advance. We went on a Thursday evening and couldn't get a table for two until 9:00 p.m.~CarolinaDiver~Charleston, SC
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Large space on New Hampshire near DuPont Circle, GW Med Center and Georgetown. Staff well trained and managed. Open design makes for background noise enough to make conversation challenging. Excellent sweet or salt lassi. Extensive menu with lots of fried items. Sister restaurant across town also gets thumbs up for fresh savory food and healthier cuisine.~RMJ11~Rottach-Egern, Germany
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love, love, love this restaurant.  Enjoyed my craft cocktail, palak chaat,  tandoori lamb chops and chili okra. Service was less than attentive, but the managerial staff is always top notch.~Marion S~Cleveland Heights, Ohio, United States
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Rasika came highly recommended. We chose their West End location because the other one had an hour and a half wait at the bar. We could not get a reservation.but got there by 6:30pm to get a seat at the bar. There is also a lovely lounge. The food was great as promised. Everyone had the crispy fried spinach which was a stand out. All our dishes were sensational.~BarbNY~Scarsdale, NY
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The famous palak chaat is delicious and very popular. The side of vegetable korma was bland as well as tiny. Sea bass entree was only so-so, not complex. Garlic Naan very small and airy. Service was only adequate, bussers attentive. A woman came around to check on us but since our food had just arrived, we couldn't report. She didn't return. Tables for two are small for several dishes and very close. The woman at the next table talked loudly and incessantly. In all, our experience was disappointing considering all the great reviews.~Alicehrh~Sarasota, Florida
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is truly one of the finest restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. And that is in this country or any other!  Their attention to  food quality, wine selection and superior service is rare to find in the food industry .~Realtor28739~Hendersonville, North Carolina
Rasika West End~3521874~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Three of us dined at Rasika recently and were blown away by the experience.  Such great food!  That's what I'd heard, and it is certainly true.  The food is contemporary rather than Colonial Indian, with a nice freshness.  The fried spinach had been highly recommended, and it was so good that we ordered a second bowl.  Other dishes were excellent, but that one stood out as something exceptional.  Our go-to dessert at an Indian restaurant is always ras malai, but it was not on the menu.  However, we asked the rather aloof waiter and were rewarded with something entirely new, a strawberry ras malai.  Delectable!~Catullus~California
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~ I was taking to dinner my friend who merely said we were going to an Indian restaurant. Little did I know it would be among the most popular places in Washington. We needed to be there by 530  what were some of the first there.    We have the tasting menu which is remarkably reasonably priced. With the exception of the tuna, which did not  taste totally fresh, all of the dishes were outstanding. The salad particularly was great.    Their chicken Tikka Masala was the best I've ever tasted.~chinadochill~san francisco, CA
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Do high-end dining only few times a year. This is a favorite when I have guests who are not going to worry about the dinner bill. Not an extensive menu but everything is excellent. Fried spinach is a must, though it has been a bit too greasy a few times.~worms2u~Washington DC
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Everything here is amazing and full of flavor.  The combinations of different ingredients and flavors are truly unique.  Can't miss.~Lexington44~Lexington, Massachusetts
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~I actually made my lunch reservation before hearing the announcement Rasika made the top 25 list for best in the US. It didn't meet that bar in my strong opinion. Ordered the mango shrimp which was amazing. However, my main dish - tikka masala chicken was extremely overcooked. The spices were amazing.  Service was a 10+. A bit uppity but that never bothers me. Would give it a 7 on a 10 scale. ~cylandrum~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~I took a group of colleagues here who had never been and they are huge fans now! Service was wonderful and the food was outstanding. Definitely get the friend spinach. That's the one thing to never miss! Can't wait to go back! ~theladyknownascady~Tulsa, Oklahoma
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~In a world where it's tough to keep up the good work in a consistent manner, Rasika continues to delight with everything from its signature fried spinach starter (must get) to the lobster main, the lamb chops and the cod, all favorites, and all excellent. Wonderful service with knowledgeable and helpful staff. Deserves its high rating.~PlatinumHoney~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Nice ambience and service but I never had tandoori chicken, which is supposed to be dry and served as pieces of breast or legs,presented in chunks of meat infused with some type of fat or oil. Also no Chana masala!~DoualaE~Pennsylvania
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Our party of 8 had a great experience in this restaurant. We couldn't get a table before 9pm as it was very busy. When we got there the owner himself was treating us and making sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. We ate Chicken Masala, Chicken Tandoori with Naan bread. Food was excellent and service extremely attentive and friendly. The final check was moderate and we would go back there every time we are in Washington!  Thanks!~pbalmer~Switzerland
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Shortly after arriving in the city I was taken to Rasika for our evening meal and I was blown away by the quality of the food and service they provided. Their beautiful vegetarian korma wasn't too sweet and had so much flavour.  Rasika set the bar high for the rest of my dining experiences while visiting DC~hmg28~Middlesbrough, United Kingdom
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~This is my 3rd or 4th time at Rasika.  This time we had a group of 16 people and enjoyed a family style dinner.  As always the food was excellent, since we were such a large group,  we had a set menu with variety of food.  Every thing was excellent, the 4 Stars because I felt the service was not up to par.  It was very slow and they were not very attentive. I think it is area the management should pay attention to. ~Lovetravelall~Fairfax, Virginia
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Title is a quote from my husband and I agree! From the marvelous aroma of spices to the creative food to the attentive service, Rasika is a delightful experience. Had been on my "must" list for a while and it did not disappoint. Now on my "must go back" list.~carsprin~Keswick, Virginia
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~Unless you particularly don't care for Indian food, this is one restaurant you should not miss when visiting DC. But be advised and book well in advance. It is a very popular spot and after enjoying lunch here it is not difficult to understand why. Rasika offers a tour of Indian cuisine rather than specializing in one particular region. That it can achieve consistency across its menu reflects well on its kitchen staff. And don't just depend on my western judgment. My lunching companion comes from Southeast Asia and he was equally impressed. I would suggest getting several of the smaller dishes and sharing. Many of the main dishes offer half portions. This way you will have the pleasure of sampling a variety of dishes from different sections of India.The sea bass dish as well as the spinach offering were particularly remarkable.  Prices are moderate and this really is value for money. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the helpful and excellent service offered by all the staff. We went to the Penn Quarter branch which is ideally located near most of the major tourist stops. So plan to include Rasika for lunch or dinner during your DC visit. But again, make reservations well in advance.~cfreedma~Sydney, Australia
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~We visited Rasika based on the rating. The quality of food served here was below average, too salty and quantity was very less to the rates that they charge.   Definitely not worth visiting for Indian food~Pratibha G~Z
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~We went here for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon.  It was excellent food, though it isn't cheap.  We spent about $100 for lunch including tip, without alcohol.  We ordered the Tandoori Chicken Tikka, which was amazing.  The chicken was large pieces of white meat expertly cooked.  It was so tender and succulent.  We also ordered the Malai Palak (entree size) and a side of the Paneer Tamatar Kofta.  Both were excellent and not overly spiced.  Rice is a la carte so we ordered an order of basmati rice and a few orders of naan.  There is a nice variety of menu options for both meat eaters and vegetarians and all the vegetable items are offered as either an entree or side dish size.  It is a great way to get a variety of food for you meal.  I finished up with the gulab jamun with cardamom ice cream (the ice cream was delicious-lightly flavored with cardamom so as not to be too overpowering) and my friend had 3 scoops of their mint chocolate ice cream (real mint in the ice cream).  This was an excellent meal and I thoroughly enjoyed myself though the price will keep it as a special occasion dining spot.~Patrick H~Birmingham, Alabama, United States
Rasika~668468~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Traveler's Choice~let's face it : DC is not the capital of food for sure.  but this restaurant is definitely worth trying if you like Indian food.  it is a bit on the "fancy" end for Indian food, but the quality of the food and the service are definitely impressive. We like the nann with garlic (I believe) very much, and we really like the chicken tikka masala the most! I think this place is probably one of the best restaurants in DC.~sandy x~san francisco
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As someone who recently move to Jersey City, I am trying a variety of restaurants. Tried Razza for the first time and really enjoyed it.  The food is very good.  Meatballs as an App, then pizza.  Very good.  I will be back!~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Being quite the pizza snob I was not expecting the terrific wood burning oven pizza served here.  I have to admit the pizza could almost rival Napoli which I consider the best in the world.  Great pizza , friendly service and convenient neighborhood restaurant.  Excellent sheet, radish, almond salad too.  ~billcarroll289~Narragansett, Rhode Island
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best pizza! with the family. Service was awesome. Attend the family quickly. Waitress was really respectful and niceWaitressWaitress Waitress was really respectful and nice~laruengarden4563~New Jersey
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First of all, I'm not a fan of these newer pizza places popping up that will not allow you to substitute or alter a pizza. Are you not making individually where you can leave one item out or charge extra for adding something on should I ask?? Secondly, I was not impressed with the drinks. $10 for a drink that was finished in two drinks. With its proximity to Manhattan I'm used to paying higher prices for drinks but this is not worthy of it. Finally, the service, maybe it was just a bad night. Our server kept mixing our food with the table next to us. I'm human and understand mistakes but never any recovery. Had she come by to check up on us she would realize but we could never get her attention. We ended up taking our pizza home since we were not able to eat with friends(pizzas come out as they are ready no matter if you are sitting together). My pizza at home (panna) was not good. Wilted arugula(the item I asked to be left off) was just simply gross. On the positive the 1 salad we split (2nd one never arrived) was delicious. The restaurant is a very trendy cool looking place. I think if you are dinning alone this place is perfect.~travelsinger97~New York City
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having seen the YouTube video about the delicious home made bread and butter served here, we had to go. My mouth waters just writing this review ....  Razza was fantastic in every way. The friendly bartender gave us great beer suggestions and we dived into the bread and butter at the bar. OMG deeeelicious! We had two different pizzas and salads. Everything was over the top yummy.   Cannot wait to come back here someday when we return to NYC. ~M J B~Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I ate at Razza end of August 2016, the food was very tasty and the bread was simply excellent. The service was fast and very professional.~Stephane Q~New York City, New York
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I loved the cozy interiors. Staff was friendly. Food- well stick to the pizza and you wont be sorry. We also tried a few small plates of bread and butter [the reviews raved about it] but we found the crust HARD AND Chewy. Also Ceci which is made of chickpeas was bland and well - we just left it. I might go again if I am craving delicious food fired pizza.~sikhasingh~Gandhinagar, India
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to Razza for the first time because of an online video called about their bread and butter. I had just moved to the neighborhood with my then boyfriend (now fiance) and was looking to scope out restaurants. After that first visit, the problem became that I never wanted to go anywhere else.   Razza defines artisinal pizza. The ingredients are hyper local, there's a map on the wall telling you where everything is grown, and there is extreme attention to detail with every dish.   The tomatoes in the sauce with the meatballs al forno taste like they were picked that morning. The burrata they serve on salads is creamy and smooth. And the pizza dough, that crisp, light, then pizza dough, is something I dream about and can never quite replicate at home. The only thing missing these days is the ricotta gnocchi, an old favorite they removed from the menu a few years ago that I hope will make a come back (?).   Razza's service is great, too. The owner is there most nights and the waitstaff is friendly and helpful. Most weekend nights they're packed so expect a wait, but isn't that usually a good sign? Besides, they have a side bar you can order drinks from while you wait.   We recently moved to Long Island City recently for a better work commute and this was the last place we visited before leaving. Razza is probably the only place I would trek back to Jersey City for (sorry, Torrico's. We still love you, too). When I go, I'll order the bread and butter, popette al forno, whatever the market salad is that day, the maple bacon or margherita pizza, and a glass or red.   Until next time, Razza.~Alec W~New York City, New York
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are a fan of Neapolitan style pizza this is not only the best example in Jersey City but it compares favorably to the best in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Only downside is that it's usually crowded and they don't take reservations.~Jay M~Jersey City, New Jersey
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you can't have NY pizza this may be the next best thing. Fresh, light and delicious. It sounds crazy but you have to order the bread and butter - have it with the meatballs as a starter. Meatballs are more like steak than ground beef - not an Italian meatball but very good. The butter is made on site and is awesome! Bread is delicious. ~mermaid939~Sunny Isles Beach, Florida
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Perfect thin crust with that coal fired taste.  Loved the pizza.  Staff are friendly and make you feel at home.~Susan C~Wilmington, Delaware
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service was very friendly & attentive.  Pizzas were light and tasty.  Place is a little crowded & noisy, but that's because it's popular !  Iced tea refills are on-the-house.~Hope Susan B~Jersey City, NJ, USA
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Such a perfect delivery of food!!! I look forward to the addition of a whole grain crust! Nice service and tasty spirits! Treat yourself to quality!!!~Shannonine C~New York, New York, United States
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is amazing. The pizza is to die for and the bread and butter just makes it even better. Honestly everything is very good and the service is great. You can't go wrong with anything that you order.~nycnrf00~New York
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here with friends while visiting on a trip from California and had an outstanding meal!  Staff was courteous and attentive.  The restaurant itself is nice, clean and well laid out.  Quite comfortable.  We ordered the homemade leavened bread and handmade cultured butter to start and it was delicious!  We shared the market plate salad that had really wonderful seasonal vegetables and heirloom tomatoes.  We split a couple of pizzas.  The Guancia and the Panna.  Both very tasty on really great thin wood fired crust.  We really enjoyed Razza and would go back.~Markculk~Oakland, California
Razza Pizza Artigianale~4062186~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~wonderful spot in downtop jersey city. pizza is very good. meatballs are awesome. friendly staff. whats not to like?~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A Farmer's Market on steroids! Great place for lunch and browsing the various stations selling food, meats, seafood, fresh vegetables, sweets, wines, olive oil, pastries, deli products and more. Located in the heart of downtown Philly. Wonderful smells fill the area. We spent a couple of hours browsing and munching.~Steve B~Lancaster, Pennsylvania
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A very busy place with a great variety of food. Got a great pork and some candies. The fresh made donuts look great but line was long.~phiddy~Washington DC
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great market with a bunch of smaller restaurants to grab something to eat. Great variety of different foods. This is very much a working market where you can buy meat, seafood, veggies and fruit, if you care to cook the food yourself instead.~Reslimpan~Providence, Rhode Island
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place to sample the best food market. Everything from fresh fish and meats to lovely cakes and cookies. There is a middle eastern sandwich place that I love  to go to for lunch. Really authentic. They have a counter you can sit at. Bring your appetite!~Marywilhelm~Locust Valley, New York
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been there eraly mirning and it has been a great surprise. Didn't really know about this market and got in just because I was passing by. You can find food of all sorts and apparently good quality as well. You can find a great variety, from meat to olive oil to candies, and also several cafes and places for lunch where you can stop for a quick one. ~Giorgiaef~London, United Kingdom
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was in center city for 5 days of business and are at reading terminal Everyday!!!! I was familiar with the area and show my  friends around the terminal. It was some first timers and the others had been a long time ago. I was 8 of us. I had breakfast 2 days and lunch every day for a week. We went different places. Never had a bad meal.  And the staff was good !~Debra R~Philadelphia
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Saturday at noon is probably not the best time to visit, but the lines move quickly or your move to Plan B.  There is an abundance of riches to eat on premise or take away.  We had souvlaki & a gyros at the Greek spot, there since 1982. Good size portion & VERY delicious! Highly recommend!~anniesullivan714~Boston, Massachusetts
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The market is superb for food to eat in or take away but be warned it gets very busy. You could spend a good hour looking around. A great place to visit.  ~FansofGreece~Cheshire
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES! There's so many options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! I highly recommend this place for... anytime!~Jewelssssssssss~Bay Harbor Islands, Florida
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a fun place to stop for an early lunch.  The crowds were there early, but it was a Saturday. There are so many food stands, it is a bit overwhelming.  Huge long line for the Amish donuts, so we decided to buy some cake for later and it was tasty.  We had the pork, broccolini sandwiches at Dinics Beef and Pork - very delicious and the boys were sweet that took your  order. It's a fun place to visit.~Cruisers58~Bend, Oregon
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thus is a really great place to visit at any time of the day, as soon as you walk in your taste buds will go crazy!  So many fantastic food options you really should visit several times during your stay.  Just a short 5 minute walk from the centre of town - highly recommend the Philly Cheese steak sandwich!~PhilLDarwen~Darwen, United Kingdom
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wander the aisles of Reading TermMarket and absorb the atmosphere of this 150 year building. Meet the Amish who bring in fresh food from their Lancaster farms~Lsbtravel1~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We loved this place.  It can easily be overwhelming, but it is great.  We are in Philly for four days and came here three. We shopped for fresh produce, meat and fish, to cook.  We also had Soul Food at Kevins, a philly cheese steak, a pecan bar from one of the bakeries.  It is amazing.  Can't wait to get back there.~TravelingTre~Chicago, Illinois
Reading Terminal Market~484853~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We spent over an hour wandering around the market it is such a busy spot with excellent people watching. We settled on a cheesesteak each and wete not dissapointed so delish! We were there at lunch time and waited around 15 minutes to be served. It wad tough to get a table but persevere everyone is in the same situation so people eat and run.~kjr2013~Ballarat, Australia
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After reading the reviews, of which some were less favorable, and the first place status on T/A, I was anticipating our visit to Pesto. Cancetta met us at the front, and was very nice. Before we sat down, she recommended the eggplant appetizer and the Canneloni seafood pasta, which other reviewers have also mentioned.  The only wines by the glass were Gallo brand. As expected my chianti was not very good. We ordered the eggplant appetizer. It had a pink sauce smothered over it. It was good, but not great, and the presentation was nonexistent.  For the main course, my wife had the recommended cannelloni and seafood, while I ordered veal marsala.They brought her a large bowl of pasta with some small shrimp in it, and pieces of what they said were lobster. Again, the bowl was smothered with the pink sauce. Not very good. The one wonderful dish was my veal marsala. The veal was not tough, and the marsala sauce was perfect. I could have licked the plate.  To sum up, there are obviously reasons why this restaurant has been the number one TripAdvisor restaurant in Phlly. Maybe success has caused a change in the experience at Pesto. I would not return, even though the veal was really good.~PAWMAW1983~Sandy Springs, Georgia
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been on a new diet and we were dying for some delicious Italian food.  We were not disappointed!  Marie, are waitperson, was a prize.  Started with the eggplant rollatine, excellent.  Moved on to the special Bronzino and the home made cavatelli with seafood.  Also, both excellent.  The pasta dish had more seafood than pasta. The restaurant is a gem, close to the airport and the stadiums. Will be making the trip back from central NJ.~jjmad2016~Somerville, New Jersey
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I chose Ristorante Pesto for dinner because of its number one rating on TripAdvisor, and I was not disappointed.  When my wife and I arrived we were warmly greeted by the lovely hostess and co-owner Concetta Varallo.  Concetta also checked on us during dinner and as we departed to insure that we were satisfied.  The menu has a number of very nice options, but there were also a large number of appetizer and entree specials.  Our appetizers and entrees were all excellent.  We also received complementary eggplant rollatini, which may be why we didn't make it to desert.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Drink orders, which seem to lag in some restaurants, were filled promptly.  Ristorante Pesto is Italian dining at its best.~LMink~Philadelphia
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I chose Ristorante Pesto for our anniversary dinner based on Trip Advisor reviews.  The place exceeded my expectations.  First of all, Concetta, who owns the restaurant with her husband, greeted us warmly with Happy Anniversary wishes.  Immediately, we were served balsamic carrots which were delicious.  Concetta then brought us over Brushetta and mozzarella and red peppers because it was our first time at the restaurant.  We ordered the crabmeat and avocado salad which was light and flavorful.  We did not order the recommended eggplant rollatine appetizer because I am not a huge fan of eggplant.  Next thing we knew, Concetta was bringing over a plate with that appetizer so we could try it.  Delicious!  Next visit, I'm definitely ordering it.  My husband had the seafood pasta entree (he loved it) and I had the veal "third one down."  The veal was very tender and the sauce was delicious.  The portions were large so I just enjoyed my leftovers for lunch today.  Because my husband and I were full, we declined dessert.  Concetta then brought over a piece of cheesecake anyway.  Unbelievable - we finished every last crumb.  The cheesecake was very light and the cinnamon on top gave it great flavor.  Concetta and our waiter checked on us several times during the meal.  I admire how Concetta was able to deal with the busy Saturday night crowd and still pay attention to each table. We brought our own wine which made the delightful meal very reasonably priced.  Last week, my daughter ,who is away at school, said that she missed good Italian food.  I know where we are taking her!!!!!  I can't wait to tell my friends about this jewel.~tipperary4~Philadelphia, PA
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My boyfriend was suggested by a co-worker to bring me here on a date. His coworker happened to know the owner and they promised us a great visit, this was an understatement.   When we first arrived we were standing around a little beyond our reservation time, Concetta, the owner, offered us and the other couple waiting a drink on the house. She was so warm and welcoming.   Once seated, we were served not only the appetizer we ordered, but multiple on the house to try. My boyfriend and I both mentioned that we have never just felt so comfortable at a restaurant.   The food and our server were incredible. His suggestions were great and he was very knowledgeable of the menu. The pasta had that nice bite if homemade pasta. I don't even like tomatoes or eggplant, but I ate it up, the dishes were impeccable.   I lived in Italy for 6 months and I can honestly say the food took me back. It was incredible, the service was incredible, and Concetta was superb. I cannot wait for the next visit, and the ones following.   ~jennygrim~McLean, Virginia
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I had dinner at Pesto on Saturday, November 5, 2016. Our meal was absolutely delicious, service was beyond attentive, and Concetta, the lovely owner/hostess, was very hospitable. The decor and ambience was warm and inviting too. Can't wait to return!~Mariadell6~Glenside, Pennsylvania
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I eat out constantly. We really enjoy trying new restaurants. Tonight we tried Pesto for the first time and it was fantastic. They serve wine but it can also be a byob which makes a huge difference in your bill. The appetizers we ordered were full of flavor and really good. We ordered two of the specials. My husband ordered the veal with brown Demi glaze sauce and it was extremely tender. I ordered the pasta special with seafood. Portion was very generous and the sauce was really good. It was a wonderful experience and we already booked another night in the future. The owner checked on us several times and she could not have been more gracious. Highly recommend! ~5MuskateersNj~NJ
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I drove to Philly to take our son who is studying a Jefferson, to take him out for a good dinner.  We found Ristorante Pesto on Trip Advisor and made a reservation based on the reviews.  This place is truly a gem.  We were greeted at the door by the friendliest co-owner (wife/husband owners).  I apologize that I neglected to ask her name.  She was engaging and sat us as soon as possible (we were early for our reservation).    We were then greeted by our waitress Marie who also was extremely friendly.  She recited at least a dozen and a half specials (appetizers and entrees) and gave us ample time to digest that and the menu.  Our hostess stopped by again to offer us a complementary appetizer.  It was a delightful surprise and was absolutely delicious (a cheese/spinach rollatini).  The pink cream sauce was phenomenal.  My wife had the pear salad special.  It was refreshing and delicious.  My son and I shared a shrimp rapped in bacon and pastry with a great light mustard sauce.  It too was perfect.  Next we had a pasta in a mildly spicy marinara sauce then followed by our entrees of salmon and two orders of veal piccata.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  The salmon was delicious and the veal melted in your mouth.  Our hostess and waitress checked on us regularly but not overbearingly.  It was a pleasure to eat here and feel like being part of the local family.    Will definitely will return and highly recommend Ristorante Pesto to Trip Advisor readers.~RalphmL~East Brunswick, New Jersey
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the Italian food you dream of. No other restaurant compares to this one....simply Delish! Have gone with family for different occasions as well as taken co workers from out of town....everyone leave beyond happy with their dinner experience.~sil1232016~Blue Bell, Pennsylvania
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited Philadelphia last week with a dear friend who is a foodie and she had already researched restaurants on Trip Advisor!  Our first night was at Ristorante Pesto and I could have ate there every night!  The food, the service and the atmosphere was incredible!  I felt like I was eating in my family's dining room in Sicily!  Loved the eggplant appetizer you can also eat for an entree!  We also had a shrimp appetizer and both ordered a chicken dish!  It was all delicious, fresh and tasty!  The waitstaff is courteous, knowledgable, friendly and extremely pleasant!   It was a great dining experience!  I would definitely go back in a heart beat!   If you are planning on visiting Philadelphia Ristorante Pesto is a must!  ~Johnnye Faye S S~Houston, Texas
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We attended the National Society of Women Engineers conference in Philly last week and called this lovely ristorante to see if they could accommodate 23 of us on a Friday evening; to my surprise they could and we couldn't have been more satisfied! I got to pick out appetizers not on the menu, everyone got to order what they wanted off the menu, and they even through in extra sides; to say everyone left full would be an understatement. It's the little things they did that made this such a great night though, I called the day of dinner to see if we could get a cake to celebrate the handing off of hands as our SWE leader and Concetta handled like a boss; she got chocolate on chocolate made fresh from ACME bakery near them, picked it up for me, and even delivered it with a sparkler to our retiring president. The waitstaff couldn't have been more accommodating and on top of things and they were even so kind as to box everything we didn't eat so that we could take it with us. For the cherry on top, the food was just delicious. Thank You Ristorante Pesto and Concetta for such a wonderful night!~Chelsea B~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had such a pleasant experience from the moment we walked in the door when we were greeted by Concetta the owner who treated us like family from the moment we met her. She was so warm and accommodating finding us a table in the already very packed restaurant.  The service was excellent, the drinks were made perfectly, the food was SO delicious and the ample portions made for a great value.  Next time we visit again from Massachusetts to visit our son who is attending college in Philadelphia we will definitely go back!!~hgput17~Wilbraham, Massachusetts
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were almost an hour late for our reservation but they held our table for us - that in and of itself makes me want to come back over and over!  The food was amazing!  We had the Eggplant Rolatini, Braciole, Bruscetta, balsamic carrots, gnocci in gorgonzola sauce, chicken parm and pollo alla carfiofi and everything was delicious.  For dessert we shared the best Banana Cream Pie ever!  We will definitely be back - the great reviews are true!~Wintertraveler~CT
Ristorante Pesto~433599~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were greeted at the door by Concetta, the owner (and her husband is in the kitchen cooking the amazing food) who was so welcoming to my husband and myself.  We mentioned we were starving and saving up for dinner and she proceeded to tell us a few recommendations that had our mouthes watering before we even sat down.  Right away we received some balsamic carrots "because she knew we were hungry".  Honestly, we didn't even open the menu before ordering because Maria came by and told us the extensive list of specials and we had already heard too many great options.  We ordered the eggplant appetizer (amazing) and I ordered the "Rachel Ray" pasta (contest winner) with shrimp, lobster and crab in a rose sauce while my husband ordered the veal that was the 3rd down on the menu.  The food was delicious.  Since this was was our first time, Maria explained, we also received another appetizer, pounded steak lightly fried and rolled with a filling of mozzarella.  We were stuffed from the wonderful meal and had our leftovers doggy bagged but still, Concetta brought us over a piece of cheesecake that is her mother's recipe.  It was so delicious that I ate the entire thing.  So the meal was wonderful, but, the feeling of being at home is the icing on the cake at this restaurant.  You feel special and it is genuine!  At the end of our evening we happened to see Maria and her sister outside the restaurant getting ready to return home.  We stayed another 10 minutes talking to them (and hearing about the new grandson) as sister even whistled a cab for us.  We can't wait to return again but with our 2 teenagers so we can share and taste more things on the menu.  Visiting this restaurant will make your evening!~ljbeller~Raleigh, North Carolina
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Following a day-trip to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, we drove into Jersey City to find a place to eat before making the trip home.  We happened upon the Newark St pedestrian mall, which had the character we were looking for.  The Roman Nose appealed with its plant-lined sidewalk seating, and we ducked in to look at the menu.  The selection of pizzas, panini, and past was attractively priced, and we chose to sit inside because of the summer heat.  Clean lines, lack of clutter, and white lights laid a modern patina on the brick-walled space and church pew anchored banquets.  A tiny bar graced the front corner.  The staff was the perfect combination of professional and personable.  It was around 4 pm, so there were only a few other patrons.  We each ordered a piccolo  pizza.  My companion ordered margarita and I ordered pesto.  The crust was thin and crispy, and the ingredients flavorful and fresh.  While it did not qualify as "real pizza" by the greasy, cheesy, fold-it-in-half-and-eat-it-with-your-hands definition, it was perfectly delightful "gourmet" pizza.  The portions were enormous for the price - we could easily have shared the personal size pizza, had we been able to agree upon a flavor.  We drank only water, which was served in a glass stopper topped bottle, but were offered an extensive wine and beverage menu.  This may seem trivial, but I liked the heavy white napkins that put me in mind of dishtowels at my Grandmother's, fifty years ago, when dish towels were white, with a stripe at each end.  The napkins may in fact have been dish towels.  Big and heavy, they stayed put on one's lap.  The flatware had heft, and upgraded the dining experience.  Upon our departure, the bartender gave us a farewell that made us feel like very appreciated regulars.  Kudos to the staff for setting just the right tone.~KLMcNeil~Ocean City, New Jersey
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great bruschetta and Cacio e Pepe!  Wait staff was friendly. Ambiance great. Authentic Roman cuisine! Owner was warm and attentive. We cannot wait to return! ~MGP521~Old Saybrook, Connecticut
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had a free night on a business trip to Jersey City so I reached out to an Italian friend who grew up in NYC and asked him for a recommendation . He suggested Roman Nose. It was authentic Italian and terrific! I had the meatballs and Insalata Caprese to start, followed by Fusilli al Pesto. If If had more free time on the trip, I would have gone back to try other items on the menu!~Darren D~Naples, Florida
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a cute little place on the always-crowded pedestrian street at Grove. Pretty fairy lights, lil bar and street chaos - just makes it a perfect combination for pre weekend party!   As for food, it stands by its name - it's authentic Italian cuisine with humongous portions. We tried the Shrimp Pasta, Pollo El Marsala E Funghi and Grande portion of Funghi E Spinachi Pizza. We absolutely loved the pizza out of all three.   ~Harshaali_Balani~New York City, New York
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love this place.   I eat there at least twice a week. They make their own pasta. The pizza is great. Not your everyday pizza, It is crisp and fresh ingredients. I love the zuccini and sausage and brocolli rabe.The owners are friendly and all the staff is too. They grown their herbs fresh outside .   The soup is good and the sandwiches are great. They have $10.00 combos for lunch. Reasonable .~phyllygd~Monroe, New York
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice terrace outside, very close to the Path station  Green salad: large, crunchy and lightly seasonned Refreshing in the summer heat  The tagliatelles ragu are good with a round full taste  Overall good food and friendly service  ~Philippe G~Hong Kong, China
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pasta and pizza spot with indoor and outdoor seating plus small bar seating area.  Dont miss the meatballs!!!!~bluerussian~jersey city nj
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Place is always packed so i tend to order takeout and eat at home.  Never disappointed in the spaghetti with meatballs or just a simple bowl of meatballs w sauce and bread. ~bluerussian~jersey city nj
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Pasta was great. Service was very nice. We went with friends for a late lunch. They had paninis and they said they were great. The place is super cool.  Great ambiance, Colorful~yayalola~New Jersey
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is absolutely delicious. Very flavorful and savory. It feels like you're getting a home cooked meal from a  loved one. Great service. Have been here several times in the past year and it never disappoints. Absolutely recommend.~sgomez01~Jersey City, New Jersey
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza as an appetizer was great.  The Bolognese was superb.  The chicken Marsala was great as well.  Good portions and reasonable prices.  Highly recommend!~Sperberlaw~Merrick, New York
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service, food and location can't be beat.  The Zucchini Pizza is unusual but wonderful.  They have a happy hour until six each day with a nice selection of beer and the house red wine is very good.  We really enjoyed talking with our waiter Victor.  He was friendly and told us a lot about the area.  The patio is a nice place to sit and people watch.  It is located across the street from the Grove Street Path station on a pedestrian only section of the street.~Mitch M~Colleyville, Texas
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Try anything, you will be satisfied. The personnel is very friendly. The wine list is superb. Highly recommended.~Comtesse_DEury~New York City, New York
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here for the pizza, and ordered margarita. Don't forget the meatballs!! The pizza was perfect and the crust was golden. Unfortunately, since it wad Mother's day, the italian donuts were sold out.... Still, it was so delicious, especially the meatball sauce.~Unisilk~Hoboken, New Jersey
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got a very large pizza to go. Topped with just about everything (peppers,sausage,mushrooms), the pizza base was thin but held up to all the toppings. We really enjoyed the pizza.~SE-Explorer~Tucson, Arizona
Roman Nose~3625851~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were three for lunch and shared a house salad which was a pretty large portion for one. Cousin had the zucca pizza, which was excellent! Hard to believe that butternut squash pizza would be good, but it was wonderful, caramelized onions & pancetta, YUM. It had a slight hint of maple syrup, not too sweet, just the right amount. My boyfriend enjoyed the Aglio e olio pasta, it was perfect, and I had the orecchiette with sausage & broccoli rabe, which had a slight hint of spiciness. All dishes were a 10 across the board! Highly recommend! ~Sirena1234~Toms River, New Jersey
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Anyone that has tried to eat out with multiple food allergies is certainly aware of the frustration than can ensue.  Rusconi's has a wonderful menu that is seasonal and ingredients prepared in  house so they are more than aware what can be adapted, left out, avoided etc.  Service was top notch which made our dinner even nicer. Still thinking about the filet medallions which were much larger than expected, with truffled mac n cheese, a lovely red wine sauce and roasted carrots and veg.  It has been two weeks since we dined here and I still remember what I had to eat so that is saying something.  My daughter with the allergies also immensely enjoyed her meal of lemon grass mussels, and some potatoes they prepared for her on the fly. They seem to have great wine specials on Sunday and Monday and a enticing happy hour with great drink specials along with some food items.  Can't wait to visit her in her new home and visit here again.  Thanks for a great dinner!~Janet P~Raleigh, North Carolina, United States
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Chef Michael is a master!  The menu changes with the seasons and the available fresh ingredients.   About once a month he does a special wine paring that is excellent.  A representative is there from their vineyard to explain their wines.  You need to book early, it always fills up because people keep coming back.~judyrhodes~Phoenix, Arizona
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a great dinner at this restaurant. Don't be fooled as you pull up to this location in a strip mall next to a Panda Express - this is a nice sit-down dining restaurant. I was very skeptical when I pulled up to the small storefront in a strip mall but once I went in I was pleasantly surprised by a bright modern decor with lots more tables to the back and a distinct fine-dining ambiance. The wait staff were friendly and helped me choose dishes for my meal.   I started with an interesting cold avocado and cucumber soup. I twas quite flavorful and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I was going to move on to the ribs on the menu but the night I was there they had a flat iron steak special. I was very pleasantly surprised by it. I finished with their bread pudding. I am a big fan of bread pudding but struggle to find places that do it the way I like it. I had it with a side of macadamia nut ice cream. The bread pudding was okay. I found it a bit rich with too much chocolate to it but it was nicely done.   The service and ambiance was pleasant and the service was good. I would definitely recommend this place and would go back when I am in the area.~DaQi~Irvine, California
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had to be sent back to the Chef 2 times. We were surprised that a professional Chef would allow uncooked pork to be served in his establishment.  We were pleased with the other dishes. Very unfortunate experience. ~JRC888~Flagstaff, Arizona
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Happy to find this place. Met some friends here during restaurant week so it was busy! Sean our server had a great personality and made the experience fun. My husband had the salmon on the restaurant week menu and I had the pork tenderloin. The food and presentation was fresh, we ate it all, however we found ourselves desiring more flavor or seasoning. We did have to wait a bit to be served but the place was packed....always a good sign!~TheEpicureanQueen~Glendale, Arizona
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had read reviews of good places to eat and this was way up on the list....what a great dinner....and was able to pick the restaurant week menu...what a deal...Our waiter Fritz was fabulous. Excellent service, great meal....if back in PHX would love to return! Kudos!~ReginaPhelps~San Francisco, California
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband picked this place based on reviews. It was really good. The night we went it was 1/2 price bottles of wine, which was a plus. We tried multiple things on the menu. We all really enjoyed everything about it. ~sdcotter~Albuquerque, New Mexico
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant proved a bit difficult to find in a shopping mall if you don't know the area like us.  From the front a very unassuming restaurant in a strip mall but much like a Tardis, bigger on the inside then out.  Restaurant was full at 6.15 on a Friday evening, need to make reservations as people being turned away.  We used the Arizona Restaurant week menu for $44 each and it was a fabulous meal.  My only gripe was the baby cabbage with my main course was far too undercooked being quite hard,  I would have much preferred it cooked more with a slight bite.  Wait staff all very pleasant plus chef Rusconi? checking all food plates before being delivered to tables.  Great value at $44 which included a glass of house wine. Lovely - will come again when in area.~Wonderar~Hertfordshire, England.
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tired of chains, this is a great alternative.  Mike is always on hand to make sure that the quality of food and service is kept to his standard, which is pretty high.  We have tried just about everything on the menu, it is all good.  Love his mac n cheese with truffle sauce.  He just started changing up the menu a bit which we appreciate the change.~Leanmikie~Phoenix, Arizona
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Upscale dining in a casual atmosphere. We were seated next to the open kitchen, which afforded us a view of their quality and plating techniques. First class kitchen. Not only is the presentation first-rate, but the quality is also top notch. Beef tenderloin medallions were melt-in-your mouth good. Truffle-Parmesan fries were outstanding. Wait staff is fast, knowledgeable and fun. Highly recommend.~AlexiVenice~Wisconsin
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate here for the first time during Restaurant Week and everything was delicious.  The stand-out dish was probably the green chili risotto appetizer with shrimp & sausage plus corn.  But everything was wonderful!  My husband had the sea scallops over grits with brussel sprouts.  I don't usually like grits but these were amazingly good.  I had the blackberry glazed salmon with fingerling potatoes, carrots & brussel sprouts which was also wonderful.  We both had the hazelnut eclair for dessert.  A glass of either red or white wine came with the Restaurant Week menu.  We will definitely come back & try items from the menu!  We were very pleased we found this restaurant.~Sandy817~Phoenix, Arizona
Rusconi's American Kitchen~3511217~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited last night at 6 pm to try this place--it's been recommended by a few friends. The four of us were blown away.  Let's break it down. Every employee that we encountered went out of his/her way to make eye contact and to say something nice to us. The place is much bigger than its strip mall storefront looks, and it has a very classy layout with some outdoor seating. Our server, Rex, was classic-great style and knowledge and hugely personable. Service was excellent. We shared the grilled asparagus appetizer and the shrimp polenta and then it was on to the salmon entree and the pork chop entree-all spectacular in creation, presentation and taste. Desert was the double chocolate bread pudding-yum. Lots of wine and cocktails and the total bill was around $100 per couple--not bad at all.  I can't believe we haven't found this wonderful addition to the food scene a lot earlier.~johnvback~Scottsdale, Arizona
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Classic NY bagels with wide selection of fillings. The whitefish was extraordinary-- the Heebster special, with whitefish and wasabi roe is a masterpiece. Also lox of many varieties are all great. The chocolate babka is to die for!  The service is great, there are numbers by the door and even if there's a line it moves quickly. ~G D~San Diego, California
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Difficult to choose between pastrami salmon and lox. Take both. Not a place to eat inside, but to take home. I loved it.~Lpinto~Brazil
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I came for brunch on a Friday afternoon. The table wait was 1.5 hours, but I chose to sit at the bar and waited about 40 minutes for that. The servers were friendly and the food was good. So was the coffee. I didn't get any drinks but the cocktails looked amazing. Very modern and clean.~pnutmnms182~Saint Louis, Missouri
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had never been to this place even though I am a born, bred and raised New Yorker. The store itself is very unremarkable save for the selection of appetizing. The countermen slice the various fish as if they are doing microsurgery. There was a line out the door and I began to wonder if this was worth the wait. When I got home and started to taste the food  there was a definite WOW factor. At twice the wait it would have been worth it. I cant say enough about the quality and taste of the food. Will be back and will gladly wait for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.~Emelen1~Mamaroneck
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to the cafe two times and the salmon in the eggs benny and on the mixed salad was just heavenly. Atmosphere in the cafe is nice and staff is friendly~andiana2016~Darmstadt, Germany
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are a lover of all smoked fish and traditional Jewish deli's than Russ &a Daughters hits the mark.  I made the error of going to the counter Deli as opposed to their sit down Cafe which is right around the corner.  If you want to sit down, head there.  You google or apple map will direct you to the counter place first.  This is really set up for locals.~djglencer~Bloomfield Hills, Michigan
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lots of choices and the smoked salmon and lox varieties. The bagles and cream cheese varieties as well were nice. Worth the visit!~Rosiedamico~Seattle, Washington
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I had 18 hours in NYC with our two daughters, age 6 and 2. We love Jewish deli food.  I'm originally from Cleveland and we had excellent, authentic Jewish deli food.  Of course NYC does too - but Russ & Daughters takes it one class higher.  The prices were expensive, but the presentation and combinations of food was amazing.  My energetic little girls we so happy with the food and presentation that they behaved and ate all of their food - and we were sitting for over an hour.  Despite some efforts the deli food in San Francisco still sucks and we just wished Russ & Daughter's would open closer to home!  For my daughters and I we split 2 smoked salmon Classic Boards and matzo ball soup, and my husband had the Shtetl Board with smoked sable and goat cheese.  We loved the coffee too. Our waitress was really friendly and sweet and bonded with us because she had a daughter similar to our 6 year old.~Danielle M~San Francisco, California
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the great landmark places in NYC for top of the line kosher foods, fish and lunch and dinner specialties.~mdocktor~Tenafly, New Jersey
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Russ and Daughters is a true classic, and I can't think of any place offering this quality and selection in terms of smoked fish for your bagel sandwiches, including various types of smoked salmon. The quality speaks for itself. That being said, it's super overpriced. I've been here a couple of times as a novelty, but there's no real reason to regularly pay $14 or more for a basic bagel sandwich. Don't get me wrong - EVERYTHING is excellent here, but the prices are absurd.~David P~Boston, Massachusetts
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for breakfast. 30 min wait. But they took our cell # and text us when a table was ready. Service was 10/10 and the food was amazing.   The classic was just that. And we really enjoyed their version of an eggs Benedict.  We will be back.~Natesalmon~Calgary, Canada
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Take a ticket and wait. For us it was 30 minutes to order our breakfast bagels. Went quick as there's always other tourists to talk to. We walked by an hour later and wad not so bad. Other counter was instant service so get some chocolate covered pecans whilst you are waiting, they are the best.  Bagels aren't one of those things that you say omg about, but they can be ordinary. These bagels were authentic and they were good. I really liked the Super Heeble and it's subtlety but my wife found it a little bland. Our onion bagel with lox and a schmear of caviar cream was an exercise in simple is best. Not out of this world, but rather like your favourite coffee from your favourite coffee place: just exactly how it should be. Just go. And wait.~nolongerjustkidding~South Pole
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This deli sells the most delightful chocolate and sweet treats on one side and amazing fish and savoury delicacies on the other side. The food looks and tastes amazing. Tip - you only need to take a ticket and wait in line if you want savoury food. ~bowlerbird~Bucks
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is about the deli on Houston, not the cafe.  This place is an experience but they sell THE best smoked fish in the city and maybe anywhere. First, there is always a line, at least on weekends, and it's usually long.  You must take a number and you MUST hang around until they call it:  they give you about 1.5 seconds to call out when your number is called before they go on to the next number.  If you miss - even by a second - it's back to the back of the line for you.  But the fish is heavenly and they have a large selection of different kinds of smoked salmon, the very best (salty) belly lox I've ever had, along with many other kinds of fish (whitefish, sable, trout,...), caviar, salads (e.g. whitefish salad, salmon salad), flavored cream cheeses, creamed herring  Etc.  all good. If you love these things, come here to get your fix.   What not to get?  For me, it's the bagels.  But then I'm really not happy with any of the many NYC bagels I've tried.~darylqu~Bridgewater, New Jersey, United States
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is seriously the best bagel ever! Grape Nova Smoked Salmon on toasted poppy seed bagel with scallion cream cheese on one side and caviar cream cheese on the other side with tomato. ~itsxjackie~Los Angeles, California
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my best dining experience I had in NYC. The lox and herrings were fantastic and the rye bread was the best I've ever had. R&D cafe is based on excellent produce and good service. Recommend.~John67-7~Australia
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was where we went to get fish for special occasions, and it hasn't changed a bit. Saturday mornings are a zoo, but Sundays you can get a darn fine bagel with a smear and some of the best smoked fish in Manhattan.~Shawnlaugh~Sherborn, Massachusetts
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wait in line.  Don't get turned off by the tight little store and tons of customers.  They are there because the food is excellent.  If you love smoked salmon there are many different choices.  We love it mild and least salty - GASPE NOVA!!! so succulent and delicious.  Excellent scallion cream cheese.  Herring several ways to delight.  AND - orange chocolate ruggalach.....soooo good!~EnjoyExploring2~Ringoe
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~had a smoked salmon bagel and egg/chocolate shake.  Great! Also tried the bagel with the white fish and lox.  All were fantastic.~Anthony P~Melbourne, Florida
Russ & Daughters~1224238~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~have to say this is probably the best breakfast i've ever had.  rarely would think of having smoked salmon for breakfast (nor pickles), but the salmon is so buttery thin in the eggs benny it's simply amazing. definitely worth the wait.  recommend going early for opening on sunday to avoid a long wait.~jenanddre~Halifax, Canada
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After getting through the initial rudeness of the hostess, over seating us while we waited for the rest of our party, we settled in to an over the top Breakfast. Small dining room (20-25 seats) plenty of outdoor seating. Our server was great. Friendly, smiling, and forever with the coffee pot.. French Toast WOW, omelette FANTASTIC, Steak and Eggs, Fit For a King.  Great overall experience and you won't leave hungry!! Will be back..~NewJerseySwooper~new jersey
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Different twist on traditional breakfast and brunch dishes.  Very delicious. Very large portions so best to share your order with another.~Ralph S~Simi Valley, California
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Good food and plenty of it. Friendly staff and nice ambiance. I have been to all of the locations and like them all!~Garf621~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went here with my daughter and three of her friends for breakfast. The place is cute and the waitress was very nice. The food was really good! I can't wait to go back! I had pancakes and home fries. Others had French toast, eggs, breakfast burrito, and more eggs/toast. Service was great and everyone liked their meals. ~Diane123Diane~Massachusetts
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went with my son and ate with a friend who lives in the city.  The place was buy at 9am and we had to wait in an adjoining space.  They did give us coffee to keep us warm as it was chilly outside.  We each ordered breakfast and it was delivered in speedy time.  The space is a bit tight and buy with millennials milling about but some old timers like us were also coming here too.  On the whole a good place to eat breakfast. ~KidLove~Pennington, New Jersey
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My son and I were in Philly for the weekend for the Eagles game (first time visit), and we were undecided about where to eat breakfast on Saturday morning.  Our Uber driver highly recommended Sabrina's.  The location on Christian St. is not fancy (anything but fancy actually), but the food was so good (and plentiful).  We have large appetites for breakfast, but we couldn't eat all the food they piled on our plates.  It was hot, well prepared, and very tasty.   It isn't often one gets such large portions of really excellent food.  We ate outside on the sidewalk, and while it isn't Paris (France), it was very nice.  The service was excellent and the food arrived at our table very quickly.  Highly recommend this place...~Montana_Rustler~Logan, Utah
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Small(ish) local restaurant with a bohemian type atmosphere with excellent food.  The food is the draw at all of the Sabrina locations. This is an oldie and the mismatch decor shows it. But don't let that fool you. The food selection is very good with some eclectic choices. We went for breakfast this day and the omelets and French toast choices were very good and generous portions. The frittata was also a good choice.  But I can't give it five stars because this time, like all other visits, left some details that were annoying. The frittata was not as ordered so when the item was sent back the other three members in our party were nearly finished when it returned. Rye toast was substituted with white. Small details, but there always seem to be one regardless of the location.  Some of the wait staff can be aloof and a bit condescending if you don't fit their age and lifestyle profile, which is annoying since service and hospitality is a big part of the dining experience.   All that being said, we still return for the food. And maybe one of these times it will come together without that one little quirk.~DinEd~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the best breakfast place I have ever been to. Get the app to "get in line" from any location and show up right when your table is ready. And you have to try the stuffed french toast!~Bridget O~Northborough, Massachusetts
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant had a great selection of foods for a great price with healthy portion size.  I will definitely visit again there were about 4 items on the menu I didn't get to try.   ~l2l76~Baton Rouge, Louisiana
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were seated outside straight away, with friendly service - food was amazing, menu was great - very large portions of filled French toast - would definitely recommend! ~DavidSpeller~Stevenage
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here with my boyfriend however the server made the experience very awkward and uncomfortable. I asked the waitress about a dish and if it was actually an appetizer or entree. The waitress said that it could work for both. I was still unsure about whether or not to order the item. My boyfriend said why don't you pick an entree. Server said "she can make her own decision." At this remark I felt very awkward and that I had to order the appetizer as my meal because of the waitress's rude comment. She tried to make my boyfriend look like a jerk and I felt guilty because of it. I should have listened to my boyfriend because his meal look amazing ( breakfast bagel sandwich ) while mine was small and not very appealing. I definitely regretted listening to our server. The rest of the dining experience was uncomfortable because of her rude remark and we both wanted to leave the restaurant. My lovely boyfriend is a nice guy and still tipped the waitress pretty well even though the experience was dreadful. We won't be coming back here anytime soon.~loughnanemeagan1994~Limerick, Pennsylvania
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to this place for the first time last week.  WOW. It was great.  The kinds of breakfast they had were amazing.  . I had some Mexican egg and potato scramble.  They had some fancy stuffed French Toast that I would have loved to have gotten if I could have spared the calories.  I went to University of Pennsylvania and I never heard of this place.  I wish I would have found it sooner so I could have tried the rest of the menu.~_jordanselzer90~Ellicott City, Maryland
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While visiting Philadelphia, our friends recommended to visit here. Very busy place, but service was still fast and efficient! Food was absolutely delicious!!! ~Alina04K~Florida Keys, Florida
Sabrina's Cafe~433407~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the food here is amazing. we have never had a bad meal. there is always a wait to get in. worth the wait. put your name in do your errands and then go back~0526candy~Key West, Florida
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best 45 minutes spend waiting in line for!!! Yes, be prepared for a long line even just before closing at 11 pm. We visited twice while in Portland for a week back in August.  The cones are out of this world but the ice cream is incredible. ~Flstina~Surprise, Arizona
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Buy pints., they let you taste some samples and then you can go home with your treasure like bourbon with brown butter or strawberry rhubarb or other pedestrian flavours.  I had stuffing give it a pass and I can not seem to appreciate olive oil.  But the pints were a hit at a dinner party, once they came out of the freezer they never went back they were whisked away so guests could eat out of the containers and try everything.  Yeah I'd go here again but be careful what you order, thyme and bread in ice cream is not good.~tiredandtravelled~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you go when the weather is nice, there is often a line wrapping around the block. The ice cream is really good, so it is generally worth the wait. Every month there are a few new flavors to try. Make sure you sample a few, even if they sound weird. You will usually be pleasantly surprised. Also, go for a "split-scoop " so you can get 2 different flavors without having to eat 1 whole scoops. ~Sarah J~Beaverton, Oregon
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Imaginative creations. Some we liked, others not so much though I think I'll eat anything that is ice cream. The white toast/apple sauce(?) was my favorite. Was it worth the one hour wait in line? no, not for me. If you crave the odd combos, then this is the place for you. The serving sizes are huge and the staff is top notch friendly and helpful.~gy820~Oahu, Hawaii
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In my humble opinion this is the best ice cream place in the world. Blue Cheese and Pear, Salted caramel thanksgiving turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy, Spiced goat cheese and pumpkin pie.......sounds terrible - tastes amazing. If want to visit a truly unique place - this is it :)~Guy B~Maccabim-Re'ut, null, Israel
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Some really cool ice cream flavors like you cant find anywhere. They'll let you taste a few before you buy. There was a long wait but it was worth it. A scoop in waffle cone was $4. O had Almond brittle ganache. Wow!~t a~Louisville, Kentucky
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is the best ice cream I think I've ever hard in my entire life.  I'm not much of an ice cream eater, but the salt and straw out did themselves.  We went at like 9:00 at night and the line was wrapped around the block so we decided to come back the next day and I'm glad we did.  I ordered the Zucchini bread and Carrot cake ice cream.  It's a little pricey, but literally the best ice cream you'll ever eat.~Cutiepet2tie~Lynchburg, Virginia
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Waited nearly 45 minutes on a Saturday night to experience this delicious ice cream. We had Almond Brittle with Ganache, Strawberry with Balsamic and Black Pepper, and a Salted Caramel Snickerdoodle. Waffle Cones are made fresh on-site and the waitstaff was awesome.. Feel free to sample whatever flavors you want, as the choices are difficult to make; and they change with the seasons. Ice cream is fresh, creamy and scrumptious. When in Portland, you gotta visit!~DC5Star~Massachusetts
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate ice cream here this summer that was so good, and flavors you wouldn't expect. Don't be surprised if you have to wait in line. Do It...It's Worth It!~wayflos~Stayton
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We take all our house guests to the 23rd Street Salt & Straw.  The line can be very long but it is worth it.~Michael W~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~2372085~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to Salt and Straw on Division after dinner. There was a queue but it moved quickly. The server asked us questions about our son who was with us and gave us some flavours to try. We had two x single scoops.. they are very large scoops and very rich but oh so yummy and not overly sweet. Really well balanced icecream with a great full fat mouth feel. We are only here a few days but another icecream will probably be on the menu!~Mel M~Sydney
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~ we waited about an hour, but when we got to the counter we understood why. The staff treat you like you are the most important person to make an ice cream decision. They allow you to taste, and taste, and taste. Our vegan (!) concierge was so pleasant and charming I can't believe I forgot her name. My husband indulged in the tasting flight, which was four different flavors. He had the Bone Marrow with roasted cherries (cherries were wonderful), strawberry balsamic (awesome), pb&j, and sour cream fig pie(didn't have a lot of fig in his small serving). I had the awesome rocky road, and a special flavor using the coconut cream pie from Dahlia's in Seattle. Nirvana. Worth the wait. However, if you are short on time, just walk in and grab a pre-made pint and a spoon. No waiting!~travellerfromatown~Allentown, Pennsylvania
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyed having our first experience at Salt and Straw at the recommendation of friends. Really good ice cream with not much of a wait time.~rogueriverturtle~Grants Pass, Oregon
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I don't understand why this place is considered the best ice cream shop in Portland.  They do some odd flavors, but the quality is not the greatest.  What's the Scoop on N. Williams is much better.~Veggies_12~Eugene, Oregon
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Luckily I'm only visiting Portland, otherwise I'd be here all the time and I'd be the size of a house.  The ice cream here is so so so good. They give you a gazillion samples, which is great as they have so many new and interesting flavours that it's almost impossible to choose.  Going back today before I have to leave. ~Vonni-UK~United Kingdom
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My mom and I where visiting Portland and read that we had to go here.  We waited in line with all of the other happy, patient guests.  When we got to the front of the line Molly welcomed us and offered for us to sample some of the unique flavors.  We each tried 2 and she offered more.  We were hesitant to hold up the long line but Molly was so sweet, insistent, present and kind that we took her up on her offer.  She explained every flavor with great enthusiasm and pride.  We felt like we were the only  ones in the shop.  Eventually we got the Honey Lavender and Balsamic Strawberry.   The home made cones were huge and delicious and a double waffle cone was only $5.50!!    We came back several more times.  Molly was amazing every time as were the other servers.  I wish that every person work in a place that allows their staff the time and respect to really focus on each guest and I wish that every person can experience such service!~jsc813~Minneapolis, MN
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Super delicious icecream with unique flavors.  Line was out the door but moved quickly and systematically.  The staff is fully involved and was great fun even with little kids.  Definitely would recommend.  ~swedishflowervalley~San Francisco, California
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thanks to rainy Saturday night, I only waited for 20 minutes (was told normally 60+ minutes waiting).  Decided to go for some unique choices, the staff was very friendly and helpful.  I ended up with taste samplers, with 5 choices in 4 cups (one of them was half & half).  Believe me, these are not tiny cups....OMG, they are all super good.  Highly recommended!!! 1. Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons 2. Honey Lavender 3. Arbequina Olive Oil 4. Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper 5. Pear & Blue Cheese~wwudbi~Atlanta, Georgia
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The ice cream was outstanding. The flavors are unique and sometimes seem odd, but work. The staff is super friendly and are happy to explain combinations and give plenty of samples! Highly recommended. One thing to note, you will most likely have to wait in line. We waited about 20 minutes. It was worth it.~Mike K~Eagle, Wisconsin
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The line was around the corner but moved very quickly.  We were able to have a couple of tastings before we ordered which is a good idea because these are flavors that are so unusual I had no idea what to expect.  The Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper is sweet and tart, so good!~bcrisp2~San Francisco, California
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The long line was worth it! I got a scoop of lavender and honey that was delicious. The house-made waffle cone was also wonderful.~aikijul~Fayetteville, Arkansas
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This highly-recommended ice cream store was a lot of fun.  We waited in line for about 45 minutes, but time passed quickly.  The flavors ranged from familiar to somewhat exotic.  The texture was fabulous and the price was less than expected - much less.  Serving sizes were quite reasonable and the staff was friendly.  Samples were encouraged and accepted!  Glad we went and glad we waited.  Would not do it again - nothing outstanding.    ~Audrey9939~Vasilikos, Greece
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was by far the best ice cream I have ever tasted! The strawberry honey balsamic had the best flavors.  I will forever be ruined as we do not have this ice cream where I live. ~Mintini11~Greensboro, North Carolina
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went there on Saturday night around 9:30 and waited for about 1hr.  It was worth to wait.  So delicious and staff are so nice.  They offered us samples and kid size with sugar cone for my daughter. My husband got Olive oil and it was awesome.  I had pear with blue cheese which I didn't taste much of blue cheese, but it was so good.  We'll come back definitely for next Portland trip.~Bobochan~LA
Salt & Straw~5081016~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yes this is indeed the best ice cream. Like ever. Sometimes I tend to avoid the over-hyped places because I feel I can find something else just as good but off the radar. Well in this case you simply must go, wait in line with everyone else and indulge. ~brooklyn24~Omaha, NE
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a local I would recommend stopping at Salt & Straw at least once if visiting. The quality is incredible and the variety is never ending. The strawberry and balsamic flavor is so refreshing and flavorful. We've never had a flavor we didn't like. If you go to the location on 23rd be prepared for a wait as you will usually find a line but it is worth it.~cshowalter~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious variety of interesting choices.  They usually offer a dairy free option as well.  Get there early to avoid the long line!~nov2115~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dropped in on a whim. Pear and blue cheese ice cream? Are you kidding me? Loved it. You know somewhat overpriced if you order vanilla but if you get one of the exotic flavors it's worth it.~janzens2016~Seattle, Washington
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent ice cream, crazy fun street side environment in the evenings.  Heard some amazing musicians on the sidewalk during one visit.  Be ready to wait in line, but it is worth it. Unlimited tastes as you try to settle on the unique flavors. ~Joe P~Kennewick, Washington
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~How have I never been to this place before? They had Halloween flavors that were wonderful, and there were so many options. I will return again! ~Velda A~Pendleton, Oregon
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One visit is all it takes!  You've never experienced ice cream heaven until you've been here and sampled their fare.  Anyone even visiting Portland should add this to the "must see" list.~G5662PKjk~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Salt & Straw always has great new flavors. I still love any of their chocolate items. But, Have tried Bone Marrow etc. and really enjoyed their seasonal flavors~Nanwil~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Saw this place of the Cooking Channel and decided to stop bye.  Great spot for an ice cream cone or cup.  Long line moved quickly.  The flavors are unique and a sample is available to help make the choice.  Located in a fashionable neighborhood away from the central district.  The hop-on hop-off tour stops up the street.~David G~Branford, Connecticut
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is by far one of the best and unusual ice cream place in the west.  The flavors range from bone marrow to pb&j.  They let you try samples which is kind of fun as they have some real unusual flavors.  Highly recommend going and having some mouth pleasing ice cream ~heumanntouch~Southern California
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very high quality ice cream and unique flavors.  The lines are long so you might be put off.  Be tough so you can get up to the counter where samples are readily given.  After finding the flavors you like during previous visits you can skip the line to buy pints from the freezer in back.  This is a classic Portland experience.~Pdxpizzaboy~Portland, Oregon
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have Bella Gelateria in Vancouver BC Canada... and lots of other great local places.  So.. guess we have been kind of spoiled.  Salt & Straw was decent but not mind blowing. Lots of interesting flavours.  Taste-tested mashed potatoes with gravy (hmmm... cannot pin point to say I like it or hate it). Glad they use metal spoons for tasting not the disposable plastic ones (thanks for being considerate to the environment!).  Went ahead with the tasting flight which comes with 4 kid-sized scoops of your choices. Had a scoop of couva coffee & cocanu craque, cinnamon snicker doodle, double fold vanilla, and sweet potato casserole with maple pecans.   By the time we had paid and sat down to enjoy the ice cream, they were half melted already.  So I wouldn't say the texture was the best I have had.  The sweet potato casserole with maple pecans was way too sweet.  There were large chunks of (maybe?) caramelized sweet potatoes... they tasted like chunks of sugar crystals (not in a good way).  The double fold vanilla is also too sweet and I couldn't really taste the vanilla.  Cinnamon snicker doodle and the coffee one were a bit better.  But overall, we have had much better gelato/ice cream elsewhere.  The flavour offerings may have been interesting but we have had that too.  And one local place close to where we live offer creative flavours that are much more delicate, all natural and well balanced at better prices.~Aggie C~Victoria, Canada
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yes the line to get in may be long most of the time but it's worth the wait. The flavors  burst in your mouth. And if you're with the one you love the experience is well worth it.~David  M~McMinnville
Salt & Straw~6739976~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~parking can be a little tricky with street and meter. it's very crowded, even on a stormy rainy day there was a line out the door. the surrounding neighborhood/area is cute. they have some interesting flavors and the line wait is doable. The staff is what makes this place great, they are so friendly, patient and helpful despite being a crazy busy tourist spot. They will explain and recommend and let you try a ton of samples with a huge genuine smile. The ice cream itself was good but I've had some great original flavors back home in Hawaii. ~steggasaurus~Honolulu, Hawaii
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best brunch by far in Jersey City. These guys squeeze their juices right there and the fantastic plates they produce out of such a tiny kitchen is amazing. It's fun, friendly and worth the wait. ~in2itMinnesota~Jersey City, New Jersey
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and nice intimate vibe without the fussy stuff.  I had the Chicken and Waffles and it was great.  It reminded me of Thanksgiving Dinner without the dry turkey.  The owner was my waiter which was impressive.  I didn't have a long wait and the food was fairly quick.  ~ErikaKane04~New York City, New York
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a very nice breakfast and good coffee to prepare us for the rest of the day. Small quite neighborhood place. If in the area I recommend you go visit.~pravione~Puerto Rico
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I came here on a Sunday late morning to have brunch with a girlfriend - there was a 45-minute wait - so we left. Had amazing brunch elsewhere in the neighborhood and returned about 3 hours later for coffee and pastry. The coffee is amazing - it's NYC Stumptown so you can't go wrong. What I couldn't understand was how on your busiest day of the week you can run out of pastry.. So if it's a good cup of coffee you want, come here & get it to go.~YayeMama~Bedminster, New Jersey
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I come to Jersey City on business quite regularly and this place is my regular go to for Breakfast and Lunch. Really good coffee (that matters!) and food - the pastries are the best! Not in the centre of town, but well worth the few minutes walk; so much better than the chain eateries... Good value too with friendly staff. Liked it so much, I bought the t-shirt!!~pbak99~Guildford, United Kingdom
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I seriously can't say enough good things about this place. My wife and I eat there all the time. I have yet to have a dish I didn't like. Even if you have to wait (pretty small and not a lot of seating), it is so worth it. The servers are very friendly even when rushed and the owner is great. Delicious coffee and delicious food with great service. ~JayUlrich~Jersey City, New Jersey
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's difficult to find anything wrong with this place, starting from its simple menu to its warm service and owner. I go there for breakfast from time to time and for a quick snack in the week-end afternoons. It's one of the few places that has become a reference around Paulus Hook for me.~Maximilian G~Jersey City, New Jersey
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Jersey City is becoming a great area that is an easy trip to NYC and has a fantastic vibe. The same is true of Sam A.M. When we arrived there on a Sunday morning there were probably twenty people in line before us but the host gave us a couple coffees and had us at a table in less than 25 minutes.  The menu is short but the food was delicious and it didn't leave you feeling bloated or heavy afterwards. The interior is small but very nicely done with an eclectic design.  My only complaint is that I was the least hip looking person in the place. It is definitely a well traveled spot and if you're close you should stop by.~Chuck1124~Upstate NY
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~On holiday from Scotland we were keen to dine where the locals went. Fortunately on our travels we were recommended SAM AM for quality breakfasts by a friendly neighbourhood fireman. What a fantastic find! Great selections of freshly cooked flavourful breakfast and lunches complimented with a variety of hot and cold beverages. A special word of thanks for Francis our server who was friendly and extremely helpful. Also worth mentioning was the overall vibe of this cafe, loads happening, great smells and excellent chilled out music. We loved it. ~GRFoster~Hamilton
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The chef is awesome!!!  He cooked for us our own personalized breakfast the way we want it...  Nice cool ambiance and very very busy !!! Lots of very happy satisfied customers going in and out with large smile in their face...  We had our custom made scrambled eggs with bacon and sausage for Chris and smoked salmon for me with side of spicy green sauce!!!  Such a great experience!!!~benoitleblanc~Colebrook, New Hampshire
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Think of it as an expresso, small yet it's lol you really need in the morning. This place is teeny but, who cares the food was delightful.  Eggs cooked to perfection and coffee that is flavorful.  We lucked out and got there early so did not have to wait long but there are only a handful of tables in this place.  A nice gentleman who appeared to be the owner greeted is with a smile.  When I ask for something spicy, other than Tabasco sauce, he brought out a very good homemade concoction. Nice local, micro sized restaurant. ~Suzana K~Dallas, Texas
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited Sam AM on Saturday morning with wife. Was a short pleasant walk from the Hyatt Regency at Exchange Place. Nice neighborhood. Is rather small with limited breakfast menu and no alcohol. Many small children.  Good service.  We had sausage gravy, biscuit and egg.  Nothing to rave about. Very rustic interior which interesting.  Would recommend if you are looking for coffee, Danish and limited menu. It is not a place to have a leisurely breakfast because they want to turn tables.~MarkS719~Mooresville, North Carolina
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went on Saturday with our two young children and had a great experience. The wait staff was very laid back and even encouraged my toddler to color on their chalkboard to entertain herself while we waited for our table. The throw back 90's music was super fun and coffee and fresh orange juice was delicious - they served us while we were waiting. Our food was pretty good but not the best we've had. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to friends visiting Jersey City.~Courtney Z~Charlotte, North Carolina
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Sam A.M. couple of times and it was always nice. The staff was very friendly every time and the food, drinks and coffee was great. We had a little chat with nearly everybody and the Chef Francis told his new brothers all his kitchen secrets :). So if you up for fun and really good food go to Sam A.M.~Micha G~Berlin, Germany
Sam A.M.~5452424~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've been there a few times and enjoyed the food and coffee. They are known for their breakfast and lunch. However, they also have a dinner club with a pre-fix menu. ~Cristina C~Jersey City, New Jersey
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Best pastrami sandwich ever.  The crowd moves fast and the food comes out hot. If you are anywhere close this should be your lunch destination. ~Tim B~Saint Louis, Missouri
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I got the Rumanian Pastrami sandwich.  Very good, large portion size.  A little bit pricey at 12$ but completely out of line for what you get.  Pickle was excellent.  It was a packed house at lunch and people seem to really like that place.  They had daily specials that looked good but I wanted to get something from their regular menu when I tried it out.~ezyano~Los Angeles, California, United States
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I live in Montana. If I could only find a restaurant that serves sandwiches half as delicious as those served at Sam LaGrassa's. A must place to eat. We got our subs and headed to the Navy Yard. What a treat to eat surrounded by the USS Constitution, the USS Young and the oldest dry dock in the US.~Bruce M~Bozeman, Montana
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like pastrami, try the Chipolte Pastrami sandwich here... amazing.  On this visit I ordered this gem again, which is my typical go to sandwich here... made exactly like the first one I had years ago... perfection.~WINEandTRAVEL~Boston, Massachusetts
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was our last day in Boston and I told my wife we had to have a couple sandwiches from here. We got there early to avoid a line...actually 10 minutes before they opened. They were nice enough to let us in to order. I got my old standard Cuban sandwich and my wife got the veggie wrap. We went back to our hotel room and devoured them. They are big enough to split, but I recommend getting two different ones and switching off a half. Fantastic! It's been 15 years since I've been back and it's still as good!~Antoine C~Orlando, Florida
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved it, great sandwiches. A well oiled machine and it has to be. Order at the counter,pay then depending on time of day be prepared to stand at a counter and eat but the pastrami and corned beef are worth doing whatever it takes to eat here.~Chuck F~Aarhus, Denmark
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our guide on freedom foot trail told us about this place! He was RIGHT!!!! Best sandwich I've EVER had.... Huge portion, fresh meat, sliced in house- all home made sauces -line out the door- community seating at long tables. Only open 11am to 3:30 Don't miss that time frame. Near the parks on freedom trail.  If you found this "helpful" pls click that button below! THXS ~ginnyp17~Orlando, Florida
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really popular lunch spot. Was here on business and stopped in with a group of 5 for lunch. We had to quickly snatch up a table and were all pretty cramped, but the food was good and portions were huge. Service was quick as well. Ordered a sandwich and half salad thinking that would be a good side order; turned out to be like having two entrees! Would return next time I'm in the area, but would probably just get the sandwich next time.~lillianseidel~Houston, Texas
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has by far some of the best sandwiches in Boston. They are always packed and you have to wait a while to place and get your order, but it is worth it. You may have to wait a while to get a seat, so I would not recommend if you are looking to have a quiet conversation or are in a hurry. But the sandwiches are phenomenal, and the closest that you can get to a real NY style deli sandwich in downtown Boston. I recommend the grilled sandwiches,and don't waste your time on vegetarian or chicken sandwiches- go for it and get the corned beef, pastrami or a Reuben- you will be very happy that you did.~jgabrieleg~Boston, Massachusetts
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visiting Boston for the first time, I read about Sam LaGrassa's on Trip Advisor.  This place is small and very crowded (only open for lunch hours) but the staff has their act together and quickly and efficiently get your order prepared.  I got the Pastrami Diablo.  One of the few places I've ever eaten where the food actually looks like the pictures online.  Fresh, hot pastrami was stacked so high I could barely get my mouth around it.  Sauce was wonderful, fresh bread.  Cole slaw was great as well ("peppery" type cole slaw, not watered-down vinegar style).  This place was incredible.  If you're planning on walking the Freedom Trail, or checking out Boston Common or the Boston Public Garden, I would highly recommend starting with lunch here.  It's just a short walk away in the financial district.  Best sandwich I've ever had.  Make this place a "must stop" if you are visiting Boston!~Steve-in-Tenn~Nashville, Tennessee
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We caught lunch here one day while doing the freedom trail. Wow. It's a cafeteria style line that you'll go through,so you'll need to know what you want. We shared a Rumanian Pastrami sandwich. We live Pastrami sandwiches and have eaten at Jewish delis, but this was the best Pastrami. Lean, tender and full of flavor. Generous portion of meat.  Seating is limited-we sat at a long community table. There's also a standing bar in a little alcove. Hey also do take out. ~ClaudiaP107~Alta Loma, California
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the Texan brisket and the southwest brisket sandwich platters, which came with fries and coleslaw for a total of $36 (I think they were both on the daily special menus). We didn't really need the chips and coleslaw in hindsight as struggled to finish the sandwich.... Really tasty sandwiches, hit the spot for lunch. The meat was really tender, nicely smoked, juicy and plenty of it, and the bread was a decent crusty rye bread. Wouldn't necessarily say it is the best sandwich ever, but would recommend it!~ct4300~Reading, United Kingdom
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We specifically took a 2 hour train journey  costing $40 each to Boston to have lunch here - not to mention the flight from the UK too!!!!  We ate here two years ago and just had to visit again as it was so fantastic. The sandwich was at least 3.5 inches deep and served with sweet picked cucumber and exactly the same man as 2 years ago made it for me.  Costing $12 each it's probably a bit pricey to eat this every day but as a special it is perfect.  The service is fast and the shop estimates they make an average of 2000 hot sandwiches per day and you can eat in or take away.  You can by sides and drinks too and the shop is open Monday to Friday closing at 15:30 hrs.  They do not open in the evenings but they are hugely popular.  I used the bathroom and it was really clean and whilst it is up 2 flights of stairs, you can use the elevator if you prefer.  You have got to go there for the experience of amazing food, do not miss it.~joy l~Derby, United Kingdom
Sam LaGrassa's~876959~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to LaGrassa's for lunch while walking the Freedom Trail. I love good pastrami. This was not good pastrami but great pastrami. My husband is not even a huge pastrami fan but he had the chipotle pastrami two days in a row. Service was great and they had brewed tea, a big plus for someone from Texas. Loved it! The sandwiches are HUGE!~travelingirlnow~Keller, Texas
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A lively place for evening dining offering a 'European' menu amidst appropriate decor. The food was pleasant and the Hungarian waiter very chatty. This is not fine dining or haute cuisine and by European standards, expensive, especially when, like other New York eateries you are expected to subsidise the staff's wages with a gratuity (why can't restaurant owners here figure out what it costs to run their restaurant and price the food appropriately ?)~Enophil~Europe
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a fantastic meal, everything was very fresh and flavorful. The service was fast and friendly.  Not a huge place but has a cool atmosphere. The chocolate budino dessert is to die for!  Can't wait until I'm able to return!~Strosser~Ontario
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I enjoyed lunch here with a large group of friends recently and was pleased with the service, atmosphere and food. Highlights of the meal were a starter board of meats, cheese and spreads. I enjoyed a tasty (and more than ample) main course as well as a very rich (but very tasty) desert. The service was very good and the restaurant was nicely appointed. If you should be in this area, I would give it consideration.~betteskid~Boston, Massachusetts
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like this place and I go there every once and then. However, I believe that they are running at very high operating costs and customers will see all of these coming at their bill. I think the menu is all good but they should raise the bar, once again considering their prices.~Maximilian G~Jersey City, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was happily surprised to eat this Manhattan style restaurant in Jersey City. The drinks, food, wine, and service were all very good.~PAffenita~New York City, New York
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last time I came here there was a very nice gentleman walking around the restaurant asking how everyone was doing and making sure our meals were prepared to our liking.  The food is always excellent and the ambiance is welcoming and cozy.  I've never had a bad experience here.~pkjersey~Jersey City, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My girlfriend and I recently came to Satis for dinner for Hudson Restaurant Week. The atmosphere here is just fantastic. Satis has a nice spot on the corner in Paulus Hook with both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoors is quite small, but very nicely put together. We chose to sit outside as the weather was just too nice to pass up.  We started off with appetizers - I ordered the patatas bravas and my girlfriend ordered the scotch egg. Both were very flavorful. I would almost say the patatas bravas were a bit over-seasoned, but they were still very good. I had never had a scotch egg before, so I don't have any comparison, but I also really enjoyed it and would definitely order a scotch egg again.  Moving onto the main course, I got the trofie a la genovese pasta dish, which was trofie pasta with arugula-basil pesto, corn, charred bell pepper, and green beans with toasted pine nuts and goat milk cheese. It was a very unique dish and full of different flavors. I don't recall having a similar dish in the past, and I really enjoyed it. My girlfriend got the cast iron roasted half chicken in bourbon pan gravy and polenta with broccoli, pecan, bacon, and smoked blue cheese dressing and said it was fantastic.  Lastly, for dessert I ordered the sweet corn panna cotta, blueberry and cornmeal shortbread and my girlfriend ordered the banana chocolate cream pie. The panna cotta comes highly recommended by me. This panna cotta was absolutely perfect - a great balance between sweet and savory. My girlfriend also enjoyed her dessert.  Satis can be quite expensive if you aren't catching a deal like Restaurant Week, but in my opinion it's worth it to give it a try. You can find quite a few dishes that aren't too common at other restaurants, and judging by the meal I had they know how to make them right. A solid four stars from me - I definitely recommend it and I will most likely return for a special occasion or other event that warrants spending a little more for a nice meal.~Craig C~Nutley, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice bistro--something on the menu for everyone. Pretty reasonable prices, too. Service was a bit slow but that was good, given we were wanting to enjoy the evening.~bevsownmail~Boston, Massachusetts
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is good but I don't find the place to be unique or inviting.  I think they could do more with the decor and the food.  The location is quiet and having an outdoor seating area is good for the summer.~Priya S~Jersey City, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This Bistro I would classify as nouveau European. We had a great dinner.  Started with appetizers of goat cheese quiche and dates wrapped in bacon.  Different and tasty.  Entrees were pasta, mint and peas and a dish prepared with carrots,couscous, mint, and pea puree.  Both of the dishes were very satisfying and unusual. Desert was a almond and zucchini cake with ricotta cheese icing; wonderful. Other dishes looked very good and featured meat, chicken and fish.~AlPesa_13~Falls Church, Virginia
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is one of my favorite restaurants in JC. The food is excellent; very consistent. The place is very pleasant and so is the service. They offer a great wine selection. ~Cristina C~Jersey City, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my second visit to Satis for a business meal and I enjoyed them both. We started with a very nice cheese and salumi plate. I then had the short ribs. I am not really a short ribs fan, but this was good, especially the bed of mashed potatoes and the sauce. My colleagues all liked their meals, mainly pasta. Service was fine. ~Ejeffrey~Falls Church, Virginia
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited during restaurant week and the place was packed - very nice wait staff. Food was excellent and for restaurant week we got great portions - definitely coming back again ~faemay2004~New York City, New York
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Satis for brunch last fall, after walking through the streets in the area for a while on a very pleasant Sunday morning.    The first thing you'll notice is the atmosphere.  The interior is classically decorated, like a fine French bistro.  In addition to the atmosphere, Satis has a super-attentive, knowledgeable and professional wait staff.  They really added to the experience, which is very refined for a relatively casual restaurant.  The food was also very good.  My french toast was awesome, and my wife got something else (I can't remember) that she loved.  We've been talking about going back ever since, and when the weather improves we'll be back again for sure. ~Arthur T~Hoboken, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were 2 couples which enjoyed our meals, ambiance, and service immensely! The restaurant itself is very cozy, a little tight,but pleasantly we were able to have a conversation without shouting or overhearing the other diners. Our waiter told us he was also the restaurant manager.  We did not get his name, but he and all of the other servers were so professional and fantastic.  Timing was flawless from taking our drink orders, dinner orders, water service, clearing our courses,  everything seemed to flow effortlessly without feeling rushed or ignored. The Manager gave us excellent appetizer suggestions, entree suggestions and wine, he was spot on!  We shared 3 small plates as our first course.  The bacon wrapped dates, patatas bravas and the Arancini, all excellent, not a speck left on the plates.  As entrees 3 of us had the hanger steak, cooked to perfection and so tender. The 4th entree was the ox-tail risotto, also excellent. With little room for dessert, we shared the Tartuffo which was very good. We would all highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to going back soon.  Parking in this area may be a challenge, but the venue is well worth any challenge.~PALABL~Cedar Knolls, New Jersey
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great find!  The concierge at the hotel recommended this place as "Mediterranean Fare"  It's really more European, almost French.  The service was excellent, the food fairly simple but very good and the prices reasonable.  I don't recall the wine list, but we were able to get a couple of decent bottles of old-world red for a reasonable price. Decor is austere but pleasant. I would highly recommend and will definitely return next visit to Jersey City.~FrequentEater666~Oakville, Canada
Satis Bistro~1998962~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wonderful menu with great imagination and care. Pescatarians and vegetarians can enjoy this neighborhood charmer as easily as carnivores. ~andreajobs~New York City, New York
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A falily friendly place with a terrifick chicken dinner,  Itcan have a hectic ambiance with the number of childre having a good time..~415koconnell~Portland, Oregon
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food and bring your appetite. When in Portland we always try to stop here for a meal. Definitely one of the best in town.~Gerald  A~Shelton
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great selections of meal items. I don't eat a lot of meat and they had numerous options of dishes without meat that were wonderful. A bit cramped areas at certain portions of the building yet well worth it for the meal.~flutterby10~Cape Meares, Oregon
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had dinner on a rainy Friday night and it was packed!!!  Get there early or be ready to wait but it's worth the weight!  Good old southern food style!  Everything is yummy lard servings !~kmorris677~Fpo
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to screen door 3 times. I only remember having the bananas fosters French toast and it was great. But this time around, I thought I'd write a review. Man...I was very pleased.  I started with the fried okra. It was a little steep in price - $7.50 - as an appetizer. I'd recommend they serve it as a side dish and knock off a few dollars. However, it was excellent. Well seasoned and fresh. I had the 3 pieces of catfish and mac & cheese. It was all very good. The catfish was full of flavor and moist. The mac & cheese is very creamy and the first couple of bites were okay...it got better the more I ate it though. I also tasted the fried chicken wings. DELICIOUS!!! It's not for everyone because it has an interesting smokey flavor. But it's moist, crispy, and flavorful. The coleslaw is good as well.  The servers are very friendly. I can't give it a 5 rating though because the service was extremely slow. Not only did we wait 40 minutes, which is a lot less than most people wait, it took our food forever to come out too. As a matter of fact, the table next to us, that was seated 6 minutes after us, received their food 12 minutes before we did. Yeah, I was trying not to me annoyed.   Anyway, it's certainly a place to check out.~KendraDawnRN~Vancouver, Washington
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I went to the Screen Door on a recommendation from a friend and we couldn't have been more pleased. We had biscuits and gravy, the amazing bacon and the hush puppies. It was very very good. Delicious homemade taste. Place was packed on a Tuesday so plan ahead as this is not a quick dining option but so worth the wait.~Tom G~Sherwood, Oregon
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really good food. Very flavorful, with high quality ingredients. Southern dishes are quite a splurge (appropriately so, but not diet friendly).  We ate lunch on a Friday and had an hour wait. The service was not very speedy either, and the food took quite a while. We had a light breakfast, so it was not easy to keep waiting and waiting. Those around us seemed to get quicker service, so it may've just been timing. Anyway, good things to choose from on the menu, and delicious food. ~COBlueSky~Denver, Colorado
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Southern meets west coast. In 3 days of a wine & dine vacation our favorite meal. Seating option includes an enclosed porch which is quite comfortable on a rainy October day.  We enjoyed hush puppies with smoked cheddar and bacon, chicken with a sweet potatoe waffle, biscuits & gravy. You know a good thing when there is a strong local clientele. I understand the dinners are excellent~Cynthia Z~Brookfield, Wisconsin, United States
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was the BEST!  The chicken dinner was delicious.  The service was great as well.  I cannot think of anything negative at all that could be said- other than I wish I could have eaten more.  ~alexespo5~Saratoga Springs, New York
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This hidden little restaurant is now so popular that it does not take reservations, but people place their names on the wait list and often remain in the vicinity for hours to enjoy the myriad culinary delights here.  The menu is always changing.  However, the praline pecan waffles are incomparable.  The chicken entrees are also delightful.  All portions are quite large and not too expensive.  There is a well stocked bar, and casual attire is usual.  Your best attempt for dining here is after normal lunch time (2-4 pm).~James V~Makawao
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This very popular restaurant is worth whatever wait may be required.  This is good southern food but bring your appetite as the servings are huge at least from my perspective. Service was pretty good considering how busy it was. I will definitely be going back to try other items on the menu.~soccerdok~Eugene, Oregon
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have been to the Screen Door many times, in fact my husband says he has dreams about their chicken and waffles.  I always get the Bananas Foster French toast and Bloody Mary, WOW!  I can't tell you how good they both are, you just have to try them.  Good coffee and tea.  Get there early, you will most likely have to wait in line, but it is worth it.  There is a small bar that you can sit at if the tables are full, and outside seating in a heated patio.  Service is always prompt and well done.  It is kind of like sitting in Granny's kitchen with the semi-open kitchen and that "family feel" that they do so well with the atmosphere.  Parking is limited to street so if you can't get a spot close by you will have to walk.~Karen P~Redmond, Oregon
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We only had one night in Portland before flying home and we luckily stumbled upon The Screen Door.  It's true what the reviews say- it's busy but worth waiting if you need to. The chicken was delicious. We enjoyed Sam, the bartender. And David, the owner, was incredibly cordial and kind. They made you feel like you were a regular.  And I need to advise you to save room for the pecan pie. It might be the best I've ever eaten and I'm from the south!  We will return.~Rebecca K~Charlottesville, Virginia
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've hoped to visit Screen Door a number of times, but the line is sometimes long so we kept postponing it for another time. Now we're glad we snuck in on a Thursday evening. The restaurant has a fun, open and lively, atmosphere and the staff are friendly and excellent.  The food is worth the wait under any circumstances. The portions are rather substantial so we elected to sample a number of sides and appetizers, which are a meal unto themselves. The cornbread was warm and fresh, collard greens and bacon cooked perfectly, and the fried chicken drums melt in the mouth once you get addicted to the buttermilk crust. We'll be back to keep trying all the different items. ~Tony B~Portland, Oregon
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow! Went there twice for breakfast during my week long visit to Portland. Great food, nice atmosphere and friendly service. Mid-week was great and no wait. On Saturday, it was very bust but the line moved quickly and the food was worth the wait. We had a great time and would go back again.~SigalH~London, United Kingdom
Screen Door~807935~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we have been twice and again found the food great.  The wait staff was great and the host was kind.  Great place to go with a group to everyone can order something different and share.  The fried chicken is just great, spicy coating and super moist.  Even good the second day as leftovers.  The greens salad is just fresh and biting and with the pomegranate seeds, really refreshing.  The brisket is awesome.  Huge portion.  The BBQ sandwhich is big.  Just yummy and lots of food.  We had a chocolate pear upside down cake and really is very good.   Loud inside and busy.   Will be back for dinner.  May have to try it for brunch as our experience at Tasty and Alder was super disappointing.~skirafthike~Sandy, Oregon, United States
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend recommended this restaurant and we owe her big!  Our server was training a new server and both were very attentive, and effective.  They recommended luscious wines, and delectable food.  We started with two flatbreads - mushroom, and the artichoke/goat cheese.  Around the table we continued with spinach and pear, and organic greens salads, butternut squash soup and mushroom bisque, all lovely.  The lamb shanks, filet, mignon, sea bass and swordfish all made for delicious dinners accompanied by Brussels sprouts.  We capped it all off with key lime pie and s'mores.~albertasn0wbird~Edmonton, Canada
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cedar planked salmon was delicious. Pecan pie shooter was yummy too. Great service. Would definitely go again. I liked that they put the calories on the menu. ~jodierau~alabama
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First time there and was a place we had wanted to try. Restaurant week was perfect opportunity. Although there were four of us, strangely we all ordered the salmon and were very happy with the selection. This was a pretty basic menu for restaurant week but at least two in our party could not finish the entire meal (a lot of food). Our server was very gracious and helpful. We never felt rushed. Would go again.~ronnomad~Mesa, Arizona
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had been to this for a retirement celebration and the passed around cocktail items were delicious.  We went for lunch with a group of co-workers and I had the lobster lettuce wraps.  They were just OK.  the little mini deserts are very good though.~Ann P~Phoenix, Arizona
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had the butternut squash soup -- delicious and no cream. We split a flatbread appetizer -- on gluten-free bread that was so good even my non-gluten-sensitive husband enjoyed it. I had a sesame salmon salad that was fresh and delicious and was large enough to take home and eat the rest for dinner. My husband had shrimp and grits -- that wasn't as good and rather smallish. Overall I really like this chain and appreciate their GF options and fresh vegetables. ~texasgal1010~Corpus Christi, Texas
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It took some time to get the table we requested on the front patio. Once seated our server took over and we felt much better. We started with birthday champagne .  We dined on side salads and beautifully prepared filets. The eatery treated us to birthday dessert.  ~12318~Detroit
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was my birthday and I requested dinner at Seasons 52.  Why because the food is good, healthy and the wait staff special.  I would ask for Channing.  She was thoughtful, informative and the service was impeccable.  Little tidbit, she actually had arrived to work very early that morning to help with the amazing dessert, pumpkin mousse.  If you have a birthday celebration, my suggestion is indeed Seasons 52.~Kathie M~Scottsdale, Arizona
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love this food. I often use this restaurant for business lunches. The menus is varied and suitable for a variety of tastes. They offer a variety of flatbreads and as the name indicates seasonal menus and specialities.  Some of my favs are their short ribs, lamb chops, shrimp and grits. This place never fails. ~Jo A~Phoenix, Arizona
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Make sure you have reservations to this "hopping'" popular restaurant attached to a mall in Scottsdale. The service was excellent as well as the food and food choices.~rg3209~Cromwell, Connecticut
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Met a group of women here for lunch and our month book club meeting.  I am vegan, so was concerned that they wouldn't have anything for me to eat.  Not only did they prepare a meal for me, but it was delicious, filling, and reasonably priced.  Love this place.  Great ambiance!~barb321~Phoenix, Arizona, USA
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seasons 52 is a very upscale, chic restaurant with very reasonable prices!  The wait staff works hard to make everything perfect? I ordered the filet mignon with roasted mushrooms, Yukon mashed potatoes, and broccolini. The entree was only $27 for everything! You normally pay for items ala carte  in an upscale restaurant.  Our whole group loved the house dressing. My friend ordered Chilean Sea Bass and said it was delectable. My husband had one of the delicious flatbreads.   The small desserts at the end of the dinner are just the right size! The key lime pie dessert is wonderful, as well as the chocolate selections.  I highly recommend Seasons 52 for a special night out!~cream78~Lima, Ohio
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food  is generally good. It seems to me that it was better a few years ago ...perhaps they changed the chef.~Paola921~Phoenix
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food they serve is all in the name. Something different all the time (whatever is in season). Try the flatbreads with a glass of wine (great selection).~Ralph D~Prescott, Az.
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food, service, and ambiance were all very good.  I had a good experience and thought the price was very reasonable for this type of restaurant.  If I return to this area, I would definitely eat here again.  ~Manny L~Pembroke Pines, Florida
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The staff was very attentive and helped us surprise the guest of honor and the atmosphere beautiful and relaxing.  The menu changes regularly to allow for dishes that are prepared in season.  Everyone enjoyed the appetizers and their individual entrees.  It was a lovely location.~25mewsician~Phoenix, Arizona
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We celebrated a BIG anniversary with our children and a few friends last Saturday, November 5th.  We had a private room for 14 people.  The service was perfect, as was the food.  Everything that should have been hot was served hot-  same for  cold.  We had chosen filet, scallops, or salmon for the entree-  all were delicious.  The wait staff was attentive, brought the courses out at the appropriate times, and all in all made for a great evening.  I would return in a minute.  You can't do better.  Everyone with whom we worked at the restaurant were so professional, from the planning to the execution.  Love Seasons 52!~barbara3123~Scottsdale, Arizona
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a reservation but chose to sit at the lovely bar. The service was great. We had the duck lollipops, the tuna tartare and we each has a small desert. I had the pumpkin with ginger snaps and it was heavenly!  I had a delicious cosmopolitan and the hubby had a good mojito.  We will be back!!!!~Ruth M~Phoenix
Seasons 52~1929294~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had heard rave reviews about this restaurant and were anxious to try it.  I think we hit it on an off day because we were quite disappointed.  The service was slow and my husband 's order was confused and our friends had to send back parts of their entrees as the meat was not done as ordered.  The broccoli was so al dente we couldn't cut it without a steak knife. The server did make up for my husband's order and he was actually quite pleasant.  The dessert was the highlight for sure!  Since we live in the East Valley I doubt we will make the drive for a second chance. Since the restaurant was packed I'm sure it's a great spot for lunch and dinner, just not for us.~Lynn H~Monterey County, California
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Chose Shuckers as it came highly recommended - disappointed in service. Seemed very understaffed.  Food was just ok for the price.  Location was convenient but probably would not go back~LorMar13~Monterey, California
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Definitely try to visit for happy hour and get the oysters. AMAZING. Had the scallops for dinner. So yummy! Service was great. Will visit again! ~EliseThompson12~Michigan, United States
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enjoyed two evenings of seafood with waitstaff and chef accommodating food allergies - very good meals~bettypon7~Spokane, Washington
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I eat at Shuckers every time I'm in Seattle and it is always delightful.  I have never had better oysters,, especially on the 1/2 shell.  Had Scallops and3 oysters - can order individually prepared six ways.  The meal was fabulous,  service attentive.  Highly recommend.~kaneira~Montgomery, Pennsylvania
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was late afternoon when we checked into the Fairmont Hotel.  After cocktails in the hotel lounge we didn't feel like venturing out for dinner.  Instead we walked down one level and into the Shuckers restaurant as a matter of convenience.  Couldn't have been a better decision.  Appetizers, salads, entrees, and service were excellent.  All of these factors lead us to have dinner at Shuckers two nights later.~RGB44~Scottsdale, Arizona
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Jay was so good at giving the best quality of customer service. It was our first time at this place and didn't really know what to order. He was very kind to recommend us the best and they came out more than expected. Awesome Service Excellence ~aciram64~Vancouver, Canada
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Shuckers Oyster Bar located in the Fairmont Olympic Hotel.  It turned out to be a very special place to celebrate our special evening.  The atmosphere is quite elegant with its old dark oak paneling and tin ceiling, yet allowing for casual attire..  The service was attentive, friendly, and professional. The menu offered a little of everything you'd expect in a fine restaurant.  Our evening started with the Pacific Calamari as an appetizer.  My wife ordered the Seafood Cioppino and I ordered the Halibut special for the day.  We ended the dinner by sharing a wonderful piece of blueberry/blackberry pie with sour cream ice cream.  Everything was plated perfectly and tasted great.  Shuckers was a wonderful place for special evening.  I'd definitely consider a return visit.~Rick R~Seattle, Washington
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I spent our 20-hr. at Shuckers and the food was fabulous. As well as the service. Definitely recommend Shuckers.~Gregg B~Corona, United States
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Shuckers is a wonderful restaurant in the Fairmont Hotel.  The food was excellent but the restaurant is quite small.  Reservations would be recommended.~photo413~Oklahoma
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great restaurant for happy hour because it offers a good selection of beer, wine, and martinis as well as good seafood and other appetizers. Try the brussels sprouts!~VaDem58~Roanoke, Virginia
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed our visit to Shuckers  because we went their during happy hour 3-5 pm. M-F. We had 3 kinds of fresh oysters for $1.50 each instead of $3.50 each. We pigged out on the oysters and a glass of local wine. Place is in the Fairmont Olympic hotel. It has the dark paneling Old World Deco. Prices are on the high end for most dishes. Service was good and food was excellent~1959rmg~Whittier, California
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have loved this place for years ..have dinner almost once a month.. Took friends from out of town Thursday night .. Worst service  we have ever had !  Really really poor .. 1/2 hr to order drinks .. Had to ask twice to get waitress to take our dinner order .. Fried oysters had so much breadcrumbs that they weighted 3 lbs each !! Shrimp & raw oysters great .. But really disappointed in service or lack of ... ~local997~Santa Fe, New Mexico
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were looking for good, fresh, local seafood.  Was going to go to pier but hotel staff recommended Shuckers.  Good option! Front desk made reservation, no waiting when we arrived.  wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about menu and preparations.  All dishes were tasty and fresh.  Seafood prepared perfectly.~ChrisH85344~Parker, Arizona
Shuckers~432669~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went for a glass of wine and some oysters (Monday to Friday 3-5 pm) $ 1.5 a shuck. Samantha, the bartender provided excellent service, and not her fault that the shuckers were falling way behind, waited 15 mins for my snack to arrive. Ambience is akin to an old cozy bar, complete with dark wood.~Ecowoman~Vancouver
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been here a few times on vacation and love the atmosphere.  It's located in the Edgewater Hotel, which is built on pilings IN the bay.  Atmosphere is outstanding due to location, view, decor, and overall vibe.  Good deals at Happy Hour in the lounge.  The fried asparagus is awesome and the tuna tacos very good.  The restaurant is great for a romantic dinner and the brunch is also excellent. ~tankr~New Hope, Pennsylvania
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a late dinner reservation which we showed up a couple hours early for. We spent about an hour and a half in the lounge prior to dinner. Great service, great drinks, and the exceptional food were complimented by very competent and professional waitstaff. We will definitely visit again and am looking forward to it!  ~Shawn O~Brewster, Washington
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a truly memorable dinner!  Great view of the harbour with the ferries going by, all lit up.  Food was outstanding... great flavours!  Our server (Annie) was one of the best servers we've ever had!!  She could give lessons on what it means to be a truly outstanding server!!  (For all four of us to feel this way is remarkable, because "picky" hardly describes us!)  Highly recommended!~Philip B~Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I found this restaurant by chance on a Google search - and my husband and I went here for my birthday dinner.  We were so delightfully surprised and pleased!  The food and service are excellent - and we were able to watch the sunset from our table overlooking the water.  I would highly recommend this gem of a restaurant inside the Edgewater Hotel.~TrisisMama~Snohomish, Washington
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Right on the water, breathtaking view.  Happy Hour Amazing.  Wonderful deals, lovely food, delicious drinks.  Would do again and again.  Wonderful experience.~Clown4321~Cincinnati, Ohio
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The menu isn't huge, but there are many things on it that I wanted to order.  I think the atmosphere is really nice.  Our service was what expected.  It was really good all around.  I would go back.~mountainsun88~idaho
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very romantic! We sat at a table right on the water and had a beautiful view complete with boats sailing by. We had great wine and enjoyed the salmon. The wait staff is very attentive. ~Lauren J~Austin, Texas
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived in Seattle on my birthday and stayed in the Edgewater Hotel, which is where the Six Seven restaurant is. We'd booked a table for 4 by the window and were not disappointed. There was plenty of choice on the menu and the food was delicious.  The service was attentive yet unobtrusive. We all had a great evening.~SuzeKingsHill~West Malling, Kent
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We decided on this restaurant because it was fairly close to our hotel, The Belltown Inn, & the view as well as good reviews here. We were not disappointed at all.  We were seated promptly with a window table as per my request & had a wonderful meal where we waited on hand & foot which you'd expect in such a high-end restaurant.  We started with appetizers, Dungness Shrimp & Crab cakes fro her & a BLT Salad for me followed by the main courses of Cedar Planked Salmon & Pan Seared Halibut then ending with Creme Brulee & the Spiced Apple Tart for dessert. All were tasty & well presented. The only way this evening could have been better was if it wasn't stormy out & we were able to get a beautiful sunset as I had planned but it wasn't meant to be so now I'll have to return & hope for better weather & perhaps sit out on their deck. Cost $188 +tip including drinks & a glass of wine each during the main course.  Will definitely return.~KeithCampbell~Alberta, Canada
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed the discounted "bar" food; I put that in quotes as the term bar definitely does not conjure the beautiful interior of Six Seven. Happy hour food items overall were of good portion size, even with the happy hour discount. Interesting drinks. Absolutely gorgeous view. We thought taking advantage of happy hour prices in the lounge would mean a dark and dingy corner of the restaurant,  however,  we had amazing views with our cocktail table and chairs. Asparagus fries were really good! And the Dark Abyss cocktail was divine! ~DnvrGrrl~Denver, Colorado
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We live in San Francisco.  We were in Seattle for a long weekend, staying at the Edgewater Hotel where SixSeven is located.  We made a reservation for Friday night dinner, and we were seated immediately when we went into the restaurant.  Our waiter came right over and asked if we wanted any drinks.  We ordered 2 glasses of cabernet and one rum drink ($29.00).  We were surprised that no bread was put on the table, but were told we could order rosemary bread of some sort for $4.00.  I do not like Rosemary, so that was not an option.  We did not have appetizers.  We ordered the cedar plank salmon ($39.00) and the Seared Diver Scallops ($39.00).  The salmon was cooked perfectly and so were the scallops, but we both like our seafood underdone somewhat so it was great.  If we were another couple we may have sent it back saying it was underdone.  The scallops were excellent as was the salmon, but not much else is on the plate.  We ordered the warm spiced apple tart for dessert and that was excellent.  At $8.00 it came with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was a great finish to the meal.  Our waiter was excellent.  Total cost, with a $20 tip, $154.91.  We are used to SF prices, but we thought this was a bit high for the amount of food on the plate.  There is valet parking only.~NancySF~Daly City
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We met a couple from out of town for a late breakfast and wanted to show off the city's sights and food.  We got the sights right with our window-front table and a stunning view of Sunday morning activities on Elliot Bay.  However the balance of our experience was a bust and embarrassing to us as hosts of our out of town guests.     The hostess was reading a book when we arrived for our reservation.  She was not openly rude but I had the feeling that we had been tagged as rubes, or maybe she was put off by being interrupted from her reading.   Our waiter was initially pleasant and helpful but maybe we were talking too much to keep his attention following our initial seating.  Sightings became more rare and getting the check took some time as our cold plates and empty glasses sat in front of us.  I had chowder that was cool and pasty like it had been sitting in the bottom of the pot for some time.  We did have a late reservation and maybe we were served the tail end of the chowder.  I also had a crab frittata that was barely warm and very dry.  And although there was plenty of crab it seemed to be nothing more than an un-turned (reheated?) omelette, topped with cheese and crab, certainly not like any frittata I'd ever had - or made.  I was not alone as each of us had similarly lukewarm and overly cooked egg dishes.     In sum, if you need to 'be seen', by all means, go.  But if you are looking for a meal and experience that represents the fine things this city has to offer look elsewhere.  Six Seven is an expensive place for a poor meal.~BentTadpole~Everett, Washington
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stayed at the hotel and wanted lunch. For some reason, we never discovered, were weren't able "to be seated in the dining room" ... despite it being 50% empty for the whole time. Faced with the choice of sitting hunched in arm chairs over a coffee table or outside at a table on a narrow balcony we chose the latter. It felt as though we'd been put on the naughty step. We incurred the surcharge... no warning and no explanation!  The burger and fries were tasty but the crispy Thai chicken had more in common with the ubiquitous fast food variety than "seasonally inspired cuisine crafted with only the freshest and finest organic and naturally raised ingredients". The accompanying asian slaw was fine but the cilantro (coriander) garnish was mostly withered and slimy. I'm glad we didn't eat dinner there.~LCAS04~Reading, United Kingdom
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for dinner. When my wife cut her salmon the waitress immediately took it away because it was raw. When they cooked it more, they burnt it and gave her a new salmon dinner instead. That dinner was excellent, but by the time it came, I was just about finished with my meal. (They took her meal off the bill.)  That brings me to my meal which was a very tough, overcooked pork tenderloin. In retrospect I should have sent it back, but I felt uncomfortable doing that with the mess of my wife's meal.  The waitress was very nice and helped us make the meal as good as possible. The manager was also very apologetic. Maybe we just caught  the perfect storm.~Judith L~Belmont, Massachusetts
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were excited to go here for brunch. The food was good. The orange juice and mimosas were not. Our server was a bit over the top. We had requested a window seat in our reservation, which I know is not always possible, but we were seated far away from the windows. I don't know... it just somehow did not meet expectations.~als03c~Abilene
Six Seven Restaurant & Lounge~433088~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While I love the food and ambience at this restaurant I was appalled to see a 2.5% surcharge on my bill.   "The surcharge is intended to assist ownership in the high cost of maintaining the integrity of the over the water facility so that we may continue to provide a unique experience to our guests."    Are you kidding me? Why is it the responsibility of the paying patron to help offset the costs of the restaurant's outside seating?   I think if you request to sit outside ( maybe they charge this fee for indoor seating as well) you should be made aware of the surcharge.  As much as I like this restaurant I probably will not go back based on the surcharge.  ~Stella51862~Eugene, Oregon
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A good place for friends, family, or a date.  The waitress was very helpful and went out of her way to make me feel comfortable about creating a gluten free order.  The food came in a decent amount of time and all was very tasty.~Larsonrso~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~All I can say is "wow" when I think of Skinner's Loft.  From the grand staircase that takes you to your second floor table (there is a bar on the first floor too), to the brief postsers of historic significance of what actually went down in this place in the 1800s, Skinner's Loft does not disappoint!  I opted for the Lobster Hash as recommended by our waitress, (because I was torn between that and the hangar steak), and I am thrilled that I went with her recommendation.  My partner opted for the traditional bacon and egg breakfast, and that was phenomenal in it's own right!  I will most definitely become a regular at Skinner's from now on if they keep doing what they're doing!  Very reasonably priced, as well!~Lady_Em87~New Hyde Park, New York
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place to eat and meet.  The place looks really small from the door, but it's mutliple floors with lots of room.  We ate on the patio out front and enjoyed the people watching, but there is also a rooftop patio.  The turkey meatloaf was amazing!~Michael H~Omaha, Nebraska
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had brunch on Sunday in the second floor dining room. Love the ambiance and comfortable vibe in this restaurant. We timed it right and were seated right away. The muffins were great and so were our entrees. I look forward to going back.~nnjpeach~Hackensack, New Jersey, USA
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just moved into Jersey City, and this was the first place I went to.  Burgers were great.  Nice selection of beers.  A=ll in all, a great first stop.  I'm sure I will be back many times~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited Skinner's Loft last week with a few friends on a recommendation. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the NY strip steak was excellent . Love the look of the place . It has three floors and you can eat al fresco on the top. I will be back to try some of the other dishes.~travelmanagerone~new jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited Skinner's Loft twice during this month with friends. The food was good, I liked NY steak and soup. When we ordered drinks the service was slow, I think this is something to work on. The place is somehow noisy during evenings.~Leonid T~Yokneam Illit, Israel
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Skinner's Loft twice.  Nice, small place, but yet you can sit comfortably.  Food is great.  Not only they taste good, you can tell the chef put in time to plan each dish to make sure they looks good as well.  Despite the place is small, they go extra mile to make the little patron(kids) feel special as well.  5 stars for Skinner's!~C U~New Jersey, United States
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Located on the pedestrian mall section of Newark Avenue, this is an attractive restaurant with an inviting, varied menu. I would like to write something nice but the brunch I had with friends was thoroughly disappointing. The start was a bucket of muffins [corn, bran, blueberry] and biscuits, although stone cold, was still a good opener. I ordered a three egg omelet with mushrooms and swiss and a side of bacon. I ordered my toast dark and home fries well done. For three eggs my omelet seemed small. When I received my omelet almost forty-five minutes after I ordered it, it was cold, greasy, and dry. My toast-- one slice of cold, dry, whole wheat bread-- was also cold and my potatoes were under done. Our service was overly solicitous but our waiter forgot the primary rule, PROVIDE GOOD SERVICE, which includes making sure that , what comes out of the kitchen is edible.~peter r~Hoboken, New Jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely place. I've gone with my dad for lunch, with my friends for Sunday brunch, and with my date for late night drinks. Awesome menu and the place is beautiful. Good for families & children too. They have a great second floor with more space and a roof top. ~zurishi~Jersey City, New Jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice relaxing atmosphere with an urban vibe. Great food both at the bar while waiting for our friends and at the table. Friendly servers and bartenders rounded out a great evening. We'll be back! ~DebMC123~Princeton, New Jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of my favorite places in JC. Laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food. Had the fillet mignon last time there and it was cooked perfectly. My wife's salmon was excellent as well. That was my first time having dinner there, usually we go for brunch which I highly recommend. Worth checking out. ~JayUlrich~Jersey City, New Jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of our favorite restaurants, that we just don't get to enough. Always a good meal, no matter what time of day, and a very pleasant atmosphere. I wish the bar was a bit bigger, as it gets crowded easily, but the restaurant is cozy and comfortable. ~David Z~Jersey City, New Jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really wanted to like this place. Great atmosphere of vintage building and old pub. Unfortunately my pizza was cold (hard congealed cheese not appealing), the fries were cold (not worth the calories to eat) and the much anticipated meat pie was just warm enough. It was busy but not such that the food should be delivered cold/lukewarm.  Waitress was friendly but service was rather slow and then to have to wait to send all our food back wasn't worth the hassle. The fried fish was hot, so they have the ability to provide food at the correct temperature.~SE-Explorer~Tucson, Arizona
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The setting is very thoughtful and quaint, with room dividers making the space more intimate and quiet.  Service is excellent!  The food was very average.  I ordered an omelette which came overcooked (despite asking for it on the "wet side") and devoid of any seasoning.  Yes it had mushrooms and tomato filling as ordered but there was no salt, no pepper and no herbs.  It was cardboard like. My dining partner has a more successful eggs Benedict.~Steven P~Jersey City, New Jersey
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place grabbed my attention right away.  I loved the interior architecture of the old building.  Those buildings make such great restaurant spaces.  The bar area on the main floor was packed and looked like everyone was having a great time.  We dined on the second floor.  I would've loved to be on the roof top but it was just too hot outside.  The food was tasty.  I had filet sliders with the string fries.  I felt that it was just a tad bit too pricey for the amount of meat I got.  The drinks weren't very strong at all.  That's the only negative I can mention.  Overall, a great spot to try out.~Matt J~Atlanta, Georgia
Skinner's Loft~1062786~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You climb many stairs to get to the "loft" but they are worth it. An old building with much character and an eclectic menu with many tasty entrees.~121maggiec88~Claremont, New Hampshire
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived around 2pm so missed the lunch hour crowds . You order at the counter and then are seated.  Menu is on a giant blackboard.   Had the 1/2 and 1/2- chopped brisket and pulled pork with beans , and a corn muffin.  Cole slaw is included.  We also tried the ribs with fries.  Great dry rub!  Sauces are included with your meals.  No beer here, only soft drinks and water. Loved the barbecue and would return!~Letty0~Miami, Florida
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Chicago may not be an iconic BBQ town, but you'll find a cure for what ails you here. Dry or wet, vinegar or no, they make the authentic stuff here. VERY CROWDED during lunch/dinner. Calling ahead and picking up is highly recommended.~JeffWagg~Chicago, Illinois
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I only drive stick shift cars, and I only eat baby back ribs that are made so you have to chew the meat off the bones.  For my birthday, we went to Smoque, which gets rave reviews from everybody and their brother/sister. I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with slaw, fries and a corn muffin.  My wife got 1/2 slab and only cole slaw.  Ambiance: almost none, on purpose.  Painted cement floor and cinderblock walls.  It's a storefront, not a polished restaurant.  Be prepared, that's all I'm saying. Let's start with the sides.  The slaw was oil and vinegar, not creamy, with a tart and sweet taste. The fries were heavily seasoned with pepper, but the salt wasn't necessary.  The corn muffin was small but dense, sweet with real corn.  Now on to the ribs: the racks were heavily smoked in a good way.  Very tasty, proving why Smoque gets applause.  Just before I was halfway through the full rack, I realized just how overwhelming the smoky flavor was, pummeling my tastebuds.  That's why the meal with slaw and two sides is the way to go.  Not for volume of food, but to provide periodic respites from the demanding smoky flavor of the ribs.  The sauce (no choice of flavors or intensity were offered) was great to my mouth's taste, but caused my nose to run.  My wife found it a bit spicy.  So, by all means, visit Smoque, order baby back ribs but intersperse bites from side dishes in between gnawing at those ribs.  Your taste buds will thank you.~GerfnitAuthor~Highland Park, Illinois
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I will make this easy. We went a long way out of our way to go here and it was more than worth it. I got the ribs and they were fantastic. the GF got the chicken and same again. Well priced and the best place we ate in Chicago. Get out of your way and come here. ~H0bbits_travels~Melbourne, Australia
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm from the South so we have an idea of how BBQ should be done.  As for the brisket it was some of the best I've had. A little crusty, plenty juicy and seasoned very well.  Not too impressed with the baked beans. A little different spin on the slaw and I liked it - simple but tasty with a bite. The pecan bread pudding was a great way to end the meal.~braxton w~Tallahassee, Florida
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recommended to us by the host of the AirBnB where we were staying. We wondered what we had let ourselves in for when we saw the queues! No problem though as they seem to have a perfect speedy system of food ordering and seating. The food was excellent, especially the brisket, which is a real plus considering the number of people being fed. BYOB too which makes it an enjoyable affordable eating experience.~david54196~Wakefield, United Kingdom
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is already enough written about the quality of the food. Unreal, best bbq in Chicagoland. But what blew us away at our last visit was the vigilance and high sensitivity to patrons with food allergies. They basically prepared our food separately, with separate utensils, in separate pans due to a slim chance of cross contamination. I wish more restaurants took this kind of care and seriousness. Awesome all around.~zarkodc~Washington DC
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is on Adam Street in the food court. Some of the best brisket and sausage I have had outside of Texas. A good quick lunch. Will definitely be back. ~PhoenisSunDog~Chesterfield, Michigan
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wait in long line, but it moves fast. typical barbeque menu- brisket, pulled pork, chicken, turkey etc.. Small sides. Best barbeque in Chicago. Love the chopped brisket sandwich~Daniel S~Chicago, Illinois
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived at about 11.30am and the restaurant was full, the smell from outside was awesome. The service was really quick even though it was packed.   We ordered half St. Louis ribs, brisket with slaw n fries and half chicken, Texas sausage links with beans n fries.   The half chicken is juicesey and cooked to perfection, not dry in the slightest and if your worried if it might seem uncooked believe me it isn't. Sausage links were succulent and tender and flavoursome but the St Louis ribs did it for me as they were just out of this world.  My friend had the brisket which i wasn't keen on but she enjoyed it. Hands down killer ribs much better than Chicago Q and Lillies Q for me.  We enjoyed so much we took some back for out plane journey home.  ~Blue_Toffee12~London, United Kingdom
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had several items for lunch while visiting the area for business. It was phenomenal! Simple setting, fair pricing. The Mac and Cheese was great! LOVED the brisket and ribs! I will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area! ~Jocelyn M~Bentonville, Arkansas
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We took advantage of a dancing show in the area to try that bbq place, and we loved it! The staff was busy but still nice, the food was awesome, and the price/quantity/quality is very well balanced. I loved the brisket, with just enough fat and falling apart, the macaroni were to die for as well as the coleslaw, the sauces were very tasty.   I would recommend it to anyone!~Irma333~Paris, France
Smoque BBQ~783193~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When it's BBQ, and when it's good...you don't need frills and atmosphere. When you walk into the restaurant you may feel like you're in someone's garage...and that's completely fine. Order at the counter, grab a table, and wait a few minutes for some good barbecue!   I hear it gets busy during lunch and dinner so be prepared to wait a little bit, but they seem to have the system down, so it won't take too long. And again...the food is good, so a little wait won't hurt.  The portions are nice, and the food is delicious.  Check it out.~tflann1234~New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A Lansingburgh institute. There are always lines for ice cream at the Snowman. They have excellent soft ice cream. The prices are fair and the cones a good size. The chocolate dip is an added pleasure. I know they have quite a menu but I always go for the soft cone dipped in chocolate.~Lissy0717~Waterford, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A visit to Snowman is like a blast from the past with great fast friendly service and a stupendous selection of flavors! A Burgh tradition!~Janet H~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although this take-out, hard & soft ice cream place generally appears to get rave reviews, my experience on Memorial Day was just average.  On the plus side, per their website, they offer 30 flavors of homemade ice cream & have been open since the early 1950's (quite an accomplishment).  They produce "all of the premium hard ice cream, yogurts and sherbets" served.  I ordered a double scoop of homemade hard ice cream so I could try 2 different flavors.  As I was eating my cup though, I realized that I'd gotten 2 scoops of the SAME flavor.  The one flavor I did get, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, was OK.  It contained dark chocolate chips that I liked, but I think they would have been better if they were larger.  Also, I was eating for a while before I found a piece of cookie dough. Another negative is that they had several old-fashioned style picnic tables (i.e., you have to step over the bench in order to sit down) in the back of their parking lot.  There's no grass there, & the side I sat on faced an abandoned building with boarded up windows next door.  While I'm sure folks bring their kids here for ice cream, it was not an appetizing site or experience in which to enjoy dessert.~fba5~Albany, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Can't be beat. Real ice cream. No ice chunks in it. Fresh ingredients. Good service. Coffee Oreo is amazing!~Matt S~Oranjestad, Aruba
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Forget the overpriced Guptill's!  For an extra 10 minutes drive you can get your ice cream for half the price!  They have a great variety of hard ice cream flavors. Three kiddie cones and a bottle of water is less than $7!!!  The ice cream is awesome too!  Good quality, hard to find flavors like maple walnut and black cherry. We make the drive at least twice a summer after stopping at Gus's Hotdogs in Watervliet. ~cpjrod510~c.p.
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great fair weather place to go.. Take your honey for a wonderful selection of dessert favorites.  My wife likes the low low calorie soft yogurt there.  Most ice cream places don't have the flavored low cal like Snowman does in different flavors and swirls!  The lines are long at busy times, but the line moves fast with the plenty of counter help. Prices are reasonable!~Don M~Green Island
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great service with a smile and quality ice cream. Look forward to them opening in the spring and sad when they close in the fall.~Bevybou~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you like hard ice cream, this is your place. I prefer soft, so to me the selection is limited. My favorite is cream-cicle with rainbow sprinkles.~Ponine23~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Prices have gone up,it gets very crowd,and this yr,think they could have used more help.serve was slow,but the ice cream is still good.parking can be a problem after games,in the summer~LaCat304~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Since 1956 I have been visiting the Snowman. Soft ice cream to die for and flavores to challenge the imagination. But for my concern about weight gain I would be a daily customer.~Robert J~Melrose, NY
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Snowman has the best ice cream around!  All winter we anxiously await for Snowman to open.  They offer a wide variety of soft and hard ice cream but the soft is what everyone comes for! It is made fresh on the premises.  They offer a low calorie version with the flavor changing weekly.  If you love ice cream, you cannot pass up Snowman! Be prepared to wait in line.  They are busy all summer long.~Lamm612~Troy, New York
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Snowman has the best Ice cream in the area,  The servce is great.Parking  good. The selection is very good. They also have a low sugar Yogert that has only 8 calaries per Oz. IT'G GOOD!!!! GO AND ENJOY yOU WILL LOVE IT~roy k~Brunswick
Snowman~835046~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~a Troy tradition.   From March to October, join the line for a great ice cream.  Soft ice cream flavors can be twisted or dipped.  Add sprinkles.  But my favorite is the hard ice cream in so many delicious flavors.  A real treat.~Kathleen A H~Troy, United States
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~An absolutely beautiful place to dine, with a crowd to match. My wife and I were staying at a nearby hotel, and the concierge suggested Sorellina. Unfortunately, we were dressed for leaf-watching, not for dining in this place, but we were welcomed warmly anyway.  My wife had a bone-in veal chop a la Milanesa, and I had a veal ravioli dish in some type of natural juices. While her chop was excellent, my ravioli was truly one of the most interesting and outstanding pasta dishes I've ever eaten anywhere.  We also split a dessert which was essentially a lemon mousse with fresh berries--fantastic! Definitely worth a return visit when we return to Boston!~Gene T~Houston
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fresh fish, perfect service, extensive/expensive wine list, lovely room but tables would improve by being another 12 inches apart. Not five stars because food not that quality, getting left behind by SRV and others.~galliardo~wales
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I consider this dining experience one of my top 1 or 2 this year.  I had the lobster gnocchi and enjoyed every last bit.  If you want to bring a client to a place for great food, exceptional service and great ambiance I recommend it.  I would love to come back the next time I am in Boston. ~Teresa B~Lake Wylie, South Carolina
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best restaurant experiences and one of the best meals I've ever had. Flawless service, excellent food and drinks, marvelous atmosphere; I can think of nothing wrong with this place.~dsikula~Pacifica, California
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our concierge recommended Sorellina and my wife and I decided to try it the day we arrived, what a great recommendation this was! The place is elegant but trendy, service impecable, and the food delicious. Excellent wine selection too! ~FernandoMexico8~Merida, Mexico
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sorellina is one of my all-time favorite spots in Boston for a nice evening out. My husband and I visited this restaurant a few years ago and it always stuck out as a top spot. The decor is beautiful and not overdone, the staff is very knowledgeable and they don't rush you out. We like to enjoy a long dinner and you can do just that at Sorellina.  We even celebrated our engagement here the night my husband popped the question :) He knew the perfect spot to take me to celebrate (or really, keep the celebrations going!). When the hostess took my coat she gave me a big smile and said congratulations, and when we sat down we had champagne already at the table. Now, of course I know my husband planned for all this, but the staff did their part to make the evening unforgettable!~Erin N~Boston, Massachusetts
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sorellina is right nex to the main building of the Boston Public Library on Copley Square. It is expensive, and worth it. The food is extraordinarily good and -- on the two occasions I've been there recently -- the service is extraordinarily professional. The noise levels are tolerable. Altogether a first-rate place. On my last visit I left my credit card behind; the restaurant telephoned me to suggest that I come bac to retrieve it before I had got three blocks out of the building.~charl0ttesville~Charlottesville, Virginia
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Atmosphere is cool and professional and the food is beyond beyond.The three dishes we had were unique and better then I have eaten in other restaurants. Being a retired chef and being Italian, my wife has tasted many romaine salads.  She scored their romaine salad far and above the best she ever had. I am an oyster lover and once spent $ 200 eating oysters. I have to say their oysters were in a class all by themselves. the mistake I made was I only ordered one plate. If I would have know how great they were I would only ordered oysters. The spaghetti dish I had was so good that I asked the manger how the chef made this dish~Rocco C~Richmond, Massachusetts
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a fantastic restaurant in Boston.  Expect to pay around $600 for 5 people with 2 bottles of wine, apps and 2 desserts.  I spent my last birthday here.  The chef prepared 2 apps for the table:  gnocchi with lobster sauce and meatballs.  Both were excellent.  We all ordered different dishes and everyone was very happy with their choices.  I got the filet mignon and ordered it medium (mistake I will order it medium rare next time).  I was not overly impressed with the desserts.  I'll probably skip them next time.  The decor is relaxing and modern and the wait service is excellent and attentive. If you're a tourist expect to get dressed up.  I have never seen anyone with jeans on in this restaurant.  Dresses and slacks are more the norm here.  They have valet as well.~Laurie G~Boston, Massachusetts, United States
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place deserves a review because it is simply my favorite restaurant in Boston. The atmosphere is great, the drinks are superb and the food is absolutely delicious. It is my go to restaurant because it never disappoints. I will be coming back here again, again and again.~CaitlinJeanet~Boston, Massachusetts
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is fantastic; a little pricey but worth every penny. We had the meatballs and the fettuccine, both sublime. To finish, we had tiramisu and an amazing chocolate dish called ciocolato. Could not fault the food Service was fantastic, servers and greeters all very attentive. Staff were also very helpful in assisting me with alcohol free cocktails which not all places have been. Would definitely go again ~jenny9666~liverpool
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was amazing!  We had a group business dinner and the service, food, pace and prices were perfect!  I tried the Foie Gras and it was delicious.  I also had what must be the house specialty of the Gnocchi with lobster and it was by far the best and lightest most delicious gnocchi with generous portion of lobster and an amazing sauce.  Everyone was raving about their food.  The service was excellent and I would definitely highly recommend this not only for a business or group dinner but for couples as well.~FrequentFlyer_1987~Buffalo, New York
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was delicious. Exceeded our expectations. The service wasn't the best but the food was delicious. I had a fettuccine pasta, the Milanesa, and tiramisu. It was amazing!~luisasings~Miami, Florida
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good!! I eat the branzino! I recommend it. Very romantic place and it's well located.  The lobster gnocchi were excellent and the dessert amazing.  It's in front of the Fairmont Plaza very recognized hotel in Boston ~594jackie~Barranquilla 
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Visited in Nov 16 for a birthday dinner. We arrived a bit late for our 6 PM reservation.  We had planned to utilize the onsite valet to park. When we arrived, no valet to be found.  No people, no signs, nothing.  We knew we were on the right street, at the right place, just no one there to take the car.  On the 3rd trip around the block,  the valet staff finally made an appearance, along with the signage (hence how we knew we were in the right spot) Maybe the valet was just bad timing on our part, maybe they were late, I don't know. It just started the night off on a sour note.  So, we get inside, get seated immediately. The interior is nice, lots of seating, lots of window space.  Clearly a popular place to eat. We waited a few minutes for our server to appear.  She arrives, takes our drink order.  My wife orders a cocktail, and since I'm not feeling 100%, I just order a soda.  The server responded with "fine" (quote).  Maybe it was me, maybe not, but this seemed to be on the ruder side of the responses I might have expected.  My wife noted it as well. So, we get our drinks, we get bread, we place our order.  Here I'll state that we had a gift card, that had been given earlier in the year.  We chose to use it a Sorellina's, among dozens of other places we could have gone to, several of which we've gone to in the past. On a side note, we've gone to dozens of higher end restaurants in Boston, in Massachusetts, in the US, and in other countries.  In other words, we may not be highly experienced travelers, but we've got at least some experience with better restaurants. We've had varying experiences in all of them.  What I usually do not see is a nearly visible reaction to the fact that we going to be paying part of our meal with a gift card.  That is what I saw.  My wife noticed this as well.  If not for my wife's reaction, I would have written off the servers reaction as just me seeing something not there.  Moving along, we got our meal.  I had the Macchernocelli pasta ($38).  Overall the dish was good, especially the wine reduction sauce.  My wife had the Gnocchi made with Lobster ($26).  She said it was OK, but felt it was somewhat overcooked. The total bill, with tip, was nearly $150.   We handed the gift card and credit card to the server, who came back with it simply left it at the table with no further comment.  Acknowledging that we got a cocktail and starter salads, neither of us felt that the meal was worth $150.  Overall, the service was acceptable but unexceptional, and while the meal was good, it was not as good as other establishments where we've spent a similar amount.~pbenware~Boston, Massachusetts
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a party of eight and we were seated a nice large round table.  This was very much appreciated since this was a business dinner.  The location, food and ambience was very nice.~Lori C~Sacramento, California
Sorellina~605870~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a wonderful dining experience! The atmosphere was beautiful and romantic, our server was excellent and the drinks and food were delicious. Everything was very fresh and homemade. Need a reservation! Would go back!~Angie652~Buffalo, NY
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A friend and I were looking for above the average Indian restaurant and struck gold with this! Service was excellent, friendly and helpful; decor nice. The lunch specials were excellent- especially the squash soup. Shrimp curry very good, as was the dal. Reasonably priced, well served and delicious. They also serve wine by the half bottle.~AUDEIC~Bedford, New York
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Booked before visiting based on tripadvisor reviews and were very pleased we did. Staff were polite and friendly, food was lovely - the starters in particular were tasty and I felt that, by NY standards, the price was good value. The portion sizes were just right. We had a starter & main course each with a nan bread to share. The also served us a small 'amuse-bouche' before hand that was divine, and although we were too full to order deserts, they brought us out a small complimentary taster that just melted in the mouth. Would highly recommend and visit again if we return to NY.~Wendy C~Peterborough, United Kingdom
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every course of the lunch special was superb high quality. The dishes are calmed down spice wise which I don't like but tasted complex and wonderful. Attentive service and reasonable prices for Manhattan. ~John A~Oakville
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great Indian food with a reasonable price in midtown,good atmosphere and good attention. Highly recommended ~migueldiazm~Madrid, Spain
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had an evening meal with the family (2 kids, 2 adults). Maybe we're spoiled in the UK with the quality of our Indian cuisine as the food here was only 'ok' by comparison - not terrible, just not great and certainly not what I'd expected from the 9th best restaurant in the whole of NYC (if Trip Advisor at time of going was to be believed). It may be the case the Indian restaurants in the US aren't that great and therefore this place stands out versus the competition, but certainly doesn't stand up to the best that the UK has to offer in terms of indian food. That said, it was reasonably priced by NYC standards and service was prompt and efficient.~CTID73~Wilmslow, United Kingdom
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are in new york you should definitely visit this restaurant. The dishes are very tasty, portion sizes are large and the staff are very friendly.~Kevin M~dublin
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Picked this restaurant because of the ranking (#9 in NY!) and the fact it served Indian. The food was good if limited somewhat, but it was not great.  Overall it was an interesting experience, as the place is quite small and the service was very good.  Just not what was expected for such a highly ranked restaurant in New York.~Peter A~Charlotte, North Carolina
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is great! The place is a bit noisy but is well worth the experience. The portion are very well served. Brilliant~Pedro S~Lisbon, Portugal
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was unexpectedly delicious food. The waiter made a great recommendation, given that it was my first experience. The staff in general was very friendly and attentive. Would definitely come back and bring friends/family.~SosiaK~New York City, New York
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very small place so make a reservation - while I did feel a little rushed after our meal was over (this is really a small space) I food was wonderful, wait staff was attentive and the prices are moderate for Midtown Manhattan dinning.~HAYNES5~Bronx, New York, USA
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We left completely shocked by the good reputation and excellent reviews this restaurant receives. Our experience was much different. The food was fair, not good and certainly not great. In our opinion, the Indian dishes overall were better than the Chinese - inspired dishes. We tried three Chinese - inspired dishes and they were all very disappointing. Although the food was not great, the real problem was the server. He was exceptionally rude and even moreso ... extremely pushy. He was a major detriment to our experience. We would most definitely not return. At their very best, they are an average to below average Indian restaurant ... at their worst, they are much less than that.~TheLearnedDoctor~Dallas, Texas
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We really liked Spice Symphony.  We had samosas, malai paneer ke tikkeh, tandoori chicken, lamb biryani and raita.  The lamb was particularly good.  There were other dishes that we would like to try but they will have to wait for the next trip to NYC.  This one is on our short list to try again.~Otto W~San Antonio
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked in without a reservation. It was packed late on a Monday night. We ate at the bar and got a real treat. We were served by the owner, Prem. My wife has a food sensitivity. He knew the recipe and ingredients of every dish on the menu. The drinks were great. The menu items are all home made with family recipes. The butternut squash soup was awesome. The Currys are wonderful. Lamb shank was great. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options too. Highly recommended!~b0nz~Milwaukee
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went here based on good reviews on trip advisor and we are so glad we did! From appetizers to dessert, excellent food and even better service. ~frankiemp~Nacogdoches, Texas
Spice Symphony~3603515~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~my husband and I have tried this restaurant twice in the past month. The service is awesome. They make you feel very welcome and they are appreciative of your business. The food is very good. I can't say it's the most amazing Indian food I've ever eaten but its up very good. Their Mango drink is delicious. The onion kulcha I could eat morning, noon and night. Overall it's an excellent establishment for a fun evening with your family.~ecivda~Spokane WA
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent food and service for a group of 16 golfers visiting from the East Coast.  There is a secret dining room through the kitchen. Great for a group. Everyone was happy with the choice to dine at Steak 44.~Gerry R~Scottsdale
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place. My favourite in Scottsdale.   Amazing crab, oysters and steak. A brilliant restaurant with a superb wine list. We had the puligny Montrachet and some great verve champagne.   We will definitely return when we are next in town. The chefs table next to the kitchen was also great fun.   Service was also very good.  It is expensive though ! ~NickAtherton~London, United Kingdom
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love, love, love. Definitely a special occasion place and my favorite steak house in the valley. From service to food to ambiance this restaurant has it all. Try the Chilean sea bass and have them poach it in butter. Amazing! Everyone I've ever recommended this place to thanks me. A must try if you're in the mood for a great steak. It is pretty pricey so be prepared to spend, but its worth it!!!~will c~Phoenix, Arizona
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Probably one of the best steaks I ever had, but also one of the most expensives. Service is good, but the place is obviously quite crowded and loud.~obrique~Vevey, Switzerland
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was great!!! We started with a great shrimp appetizer and moved our way into salads and on to the main course. I usually go for the NY Strip. You rarely go wrong with that cut and it did not disappoint! The steaks were cooked perfectly. The sides were excellent and a nice variety. I highly recommend the corn creme brulee. If I had to give anything a thumbs down here is that for a steakhouse, they do not have a prime rib. BUT everything else from the wine list to the excellent service to the ambiance to the food...fantastic.~Fer13~Phoenix, Arizona
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Steak 44 - thank you!  What a superb anniversary dinner and evening!  Everything was amazing, one "wow moment" after another, from the colossal shrimp cocktail, delicious champagne, superb steak with all the trimmings -- all the way through dessert.  What a gorgeous place with fantastic staff, and they did not miss an opportunity to make us feel celebrated.  The filet mignon was superb - like butter.  We were treated like royalty - it was a very special evening. In the top 5 best meals I have had in a restaurant.~Cheryl U~Union, Ohio
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was taken last night- ate at bar.  Had a Happy Hour small filet and french fries.  Both were super salty.  Bread was good.  Then ordered a large filet to share and mushrooms- again, LOTS of sale.  I am a Ruth's Chris customer and much prefer Ruth's over this.~phxbear1~Phoenix, Arizona
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We visited Steak 44 on a Saturday evening and despite it being very busy we were seated immediately just before our reservation time. The decor is beautiful and although it is a large restaurant there are smaller rooms which give a more personal intimate feel. The food was fantastic, the wines were reasonably priced, the service was impeccable and the cappuccino was one of the largest I have ever had !  We even received a follow up phone call the next day to make sure we had a great experience. We would definitely return if we are in the area again and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an upscale steak and seafood dining experience.~Sharon T~Hawthorn Woods, Illinois
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With other old favourites starting to slip, Steak 44 was a wonderful find, recommended by a friend when we were on a visit home. Great service, amazing steak.~ideaman68~Brisbane, Australia
Steak 44~3839768~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~first visit here beautiful venue great staff Sara was superb fabulous food drink and atmosphere Kenny the manager asked if all was ok I explained It was a friends wedding anniversary and then a beautiful complimentary dessert arrived at the table with happy anniversary piped in chocolate superb~david w~Baslow, United Kingdom
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A Syracuse staple. A good place to start your day at a reasonable cost. Portions are ridiculous(and I have an appetite). The fretta is awesome, The service is fast with quick refills of coffee. When the kids are in town, This is where we meet.~vaultcoach~Fayetteville, New York
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A can't miss breakfast place. Fast service, great menu and specials. Reasonably priced, very popular, sometimes a short wait but they move fast.~dparsons1950~Canandaigua, New York
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I reviewed this restaurant previously and stated that I wished they had goulash more often.  I noticed recently that they have goulash on the menu all the time now, but the last time I had it, it didn't live up to my expectations (maybe just an off day).  Breakfast is the best meal of the day and I shouldn't be saying that as it is already so crowded, it's difficult to get in!  But, I'll be honest as always.  Servers still do a great job and there is always an interesting mix of customers.  Portions are definitely generous and the food is good.~luv2travel48713~Syracuse, New York
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I stopped here with my wife for breakfast on the way to Destiny. It is conveniently located to the Mall. The service was excellent and the portions were generous. The food was good quality. For instance, I had the steak and eggs and the New York Strip was thick and well cooked, unlike the typical shoe leather steak that you get at a diner. The place was clean with a traditional American Diner atmosphere. A great place for breakfast in Syracuse.~Todd B~Herkimer
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's always a good sign when the parking lot is full. Despite a large lunch crowd, we were seated immediately. Our server was prompt, attentive, and courteous. The quality and quantity of the food was very good and the prices reasonable. Just what you'd want in a diner!~edstu43~Short Hills, NJ
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last year's visit to Syracuse was on a weekend and based on the reviews knew Stella's would be crazy crowded. Went Halloween morning and was able to get a table and fast service. Some of the staff were in costumes. The diner is bedazzled in Betty Boop, but it wasn't overwhelming. I had the French toast with eggs and hash. My hubby had it with bacon and strawberries. He loved that the strawberries were fresh and I loved that the corned beef hash was crispy. The French toast was"meh." The coffee was plentiful but lukewarm. This diner is three minutes away from my hotel, the Aloft which was great. I'll definitely visit it again for the hash. The staff was very pleasant and welcoming.~Type1Traveler~Long Island, New YOrk
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Let me start by saying if you are going on a weekend expect to wait but it moves fast and worth the wait! Everything is made from scratch and really good, service was efficient and fast and the plates are huge. We had breakfast at 9:30 and did not eat till 6:30 that night the price for three huge breakfasts coffees tea and hot chocolate was $30.00! Great food great prices~Steven B~Speculator, New York
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I stopped by on our way up North.

Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Old fashion diner.   This was a great - by chance- find.  It's a little off the beaten path but well worth GPS.  Close to the university.  We had to wait about 25 mins to be seated but it was Saturday during family weekend at Syracuse Univ.  Since it was Halloween weekend the staff dressed in costume, I loved it.  The food is wonderful.  Huge portions, we all took a to-go box.  4 of us ate for $56.00 and I had a glass of wine!  I had the Rattlesnake Pasta - Delicious, the sauce was just the right spicy.  My daughter had Greek pasta with grill shrimp, also super.  my son and husband had the specials for the night and we not disappointed. The staff were friendly and quick.  The booth was large and very roomy. I would say GO!!~Janet L~Highland Mills

Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were lucky to get a table right away for a late breakfast. We were told by our friends that we would probably have to wait but we did not.   All of the egg dishes were delicious that we tried, as were the breakfast sandwiches and French Toast.  Portions are huge, the sausage is the delicious local variety, and the variety is endless.  Plenty of unlimited coffee was brought to the table.   Nobody left the place hungry, that is for sure.~mikel12323~Houston, Texas
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to this diner for breakfast. Even though it was crowded we were seated right away. The serving staff were very friendly and constantly filling up your coffee. I had French toast, eggs and the Italian sausage. Food was great. Prices were very reasonable. If I ever visit the area again I'll definitely be eating there~castroc342~New Windsor, New York
Stella's Diner~421817~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we tried to get in to have a late breakfast last Saturday around 11 AM and encountered many a patron waiting in line; we were fortunate and managed to find 2 stools at the bar and ended up almost finishing our breakfast when they had finally called our names for a table  :-)    Great place for breakfast ....~Burke55~East Syracuse, New York

Highly recommend for anyone !~asiana747~Toronto, Canada
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I got a mixed sashimi but the fish I got didn't seem to be very fresh. Actually I doubt it was. And it s not cheap. good service though and a lot of different option to choose. ~KIllmosquitos~Milan, Italy
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love the Farmer Market. I had a pretty authentic capuccino and amazing fruit smoothy. It is nice to have the possibility to walk around, get fresh fruits in the market (a bit expensive though), and find nice shops around.~CateMilk~Greater London, United Kingdom
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I never get tired of Farmer's Market.  There's all kinds of food, all kinds of people from everywhere in the world and plenty of locals -- a good place to meet friends.  There's stalls to buy cheese, produce, the best meat and fish, and lots of restaurant stalls.  On summer nights there's live music.~Habitat P~Los Angeles, California
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you love food as much as I do this place is a must for any foodie. I loved the energy of this place with foods from all around the world. Great menu items to choose from. Easy access parking. I would have loved to spend a few hours on my own in this place. With kids it can get too crazy as this place packs up quickly. I would return here again in a heart beat. ~FirstClass001~Toronto, Canada
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love this place! While wandering around the Farmers Markets I came across this little gem of place. In one week I ate here 3 times the food was so nice and the service so friendly. Would highly recommend trying this place as the food is so fresh and nice and made for you while you wait.~MuscleDog~Perth, Australia
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved it. Such a selection of foods and shops perfect for anyone's tastes. We had a gorgeous Gumbo ya ya and a jambalaya and the corn bread yum yum yum. Good clean and cheap food. Wonderful quaint shops to look in. Great nuts and candy gifts. Head out into the grove and that's a whole different atmosphere. Lots of specialty shops to browse in. Make the effort to get there. You won't be disappointed.~fisher1962~Sydney Australia
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Such a great contrast to the modern shops in the grove. Reminds me if the market in Barcelona. Lots of variety, if not sauce is your things they have this great shop selling hot sauce that comes with a caution.~luluxlou~London
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The LA Farmers Market is a local icon and has been around forever - I first visited there as a kid & it's still fun many decades later. Loaded with eateries of all sorts with chairs & tables sprinkled in between. TIP: 1) wander around & decide which eatery you want, or several, 2) then have 1 member of your party find a table & sit there 3) other members of your party bring the ordered food to the table. ...Much better than wandering about looking for a table w food in one hand & a drink in another! Not gourmet, but fun food experience, plus the Grove is just next door! Have fun...~David B L~Los Angeles, California
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are a lot of different food stands, fruit and cool stores. We had lunch at Sushi-A-Go-Go because we want to try something different in a farmer's market. Their sashimi is fresh and the today special sushi of that day is really delicious. Their Miso Soup is pretty good too. We went to "the French Crepe Co." for dessert. We ordered La Napoleon which we customize our own crepe. Their crepe is made upon order so the crepe is pretty fresh and really good!!!~SJessica522~Thousand Oaks, California
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a place I must have been to 3-4 times and everytime it has been amazing. Honestly, I was a bit surprised to see such high rating of this place on Tripadvisor as I thought that in a place like LA and in a location like the Farmers Market it is very difficult for a sushi place to stand out as there are quite a few options for eating.......however after trying their Shrimp Tempura Udon, Shrimp roll (yes I am a big shrimp fan) Salmon roll and Veggie Roll it is clear that this is one of the best places to eat............so next time you are in Farmers Market don't get carried away by the look of this place it looks tiny and unassuming but it is amazing!!~GurpreetMehdiratta~New Delhi, India
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very beautiful and fine farmer's market place.   The overall feel was quite stunning because of the Christmas season, decorations and enthusiastic crowd. A lot of food ranging from fine dining, coffee shops, candy stores to snack bars make it a place for all ages. Some interesting artifacts placed in the area such as the model of old gas station are interesting.   The shopping streets, water fountains, pond and statues offer a European feel.~Suchig06~New Delhi, India
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very touristy, but I actually found some amazing fresh fruit for sale, and once I spent time actually exploring the Farmer's Market, I was amazed! Comfy in a fast paced big city meets little city way, with a selection of shops and great, fresh food. Gotta see it!~Joy_Villa~New York City, New York
Sushi A Go Go~509121~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a great crunchy sushi roll at Sushi A Go Go!  The service was super friendly and the sushi delicious!  Outdoor seating is nearby in a pleasant area of the Farmer's Market.~marsle~Georgia
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A cosy and delicious restaurant right up against Camelback Mountain.  A favorite brunch spot.  It is wonderful to wonder the beauitful garden and grounds.  It's like being in another country.~JKLS333~Washington DC, District of Columbia
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been here three times over the past year and it is consistently wonderful.  Staff is friendly and attentive without hovering over your table.  Their short ribs and mashed potatoes with gorgonzola are to die for!~sopacey~Phoenix, Arizona
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food and service were superb. A great place for a special celebration, although a bit pricey.  We will definitely return.~WHS-Eagle~Prescott, Arizona
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely atmosphere, service, and food. All in all, the atmosphere and the service surpass the food, It is one of those places you will always remember going, because of how nice the ambiance was. ~TAS~Scottsdale, AZ
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My sister, husband & I had a fabulous celebratory dinner at T.Cooks. The presentation was beautiful & made all our dinner choices just a little bit better!!  The food did not disappoint. One of the highlights of the evening was our waiter, Sasha. He was helpful, cheerful & had a great sense of humor - definitely an asset to one of our favorite restaurants!~MarleneandHarvey~Tempe
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I just went here for a quick lunch. The setting is very nice and the server was very good. It was lunch so we both ordered at Turkey Club, one with pumpkin soup as a side and the other had fries. $16.00 was the cost each.The turkey was not carved turkey but processed turkey breast. The side of soup was excellent. The fries were luke warm and nothing special. We have been here before and this meal was just average compared with the past.~Richard S~Scottsdale, Arizona
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Only restaurant on-site at Royal Palms. Very pricey, but, great outside seating. Food is good, breakfast here as well.~DelawareSparky~delaware
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~T. Cook's is absolutely amazing. We ate here for breakfast and then for dinner because we were so impressed the first time. During breakfast, our server was Tenino. He was very knowledgable of the menu and helpful with making decisions. His positive attitude was a great attribute to our morning. I had the Breakfast Burrito and my mind was blown (Well done to Chef, you made a girl that doesn't like breakfast, like breakfast). My boyfriend ordered the Brown Butter Pancakes and was equally as happy with his meal.   Later we came back for dinner and had a similar, amazing experience. We ordered the Roasted Spanish Octopus and Saltspring Black Mussels from the Tapas Fireplace Bar which were mouthwatering. I couldn't believe how huge the octopus tentacle was! For our second course I ate the 8oz Filet Mignon which was perfectly cooked and he had the Grilled Venison Loin - which was later named one of his favorite meals.   Thank you, Executive Chef, and your culinary team, for giving us an amazing day of food.~lmborland~Park City, Utah
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~T. Cook's is excellent.  The wait staff is friendly and the food is amazing.  Try the corn chowder, best I have ever tasted.  The Sunday Brunch is awesome.  Great, great restaurant.~JDW92~Missouri City, Texas
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are lots of resort restaurants in the valley and T Cooks is in my Top 5. Special occasion or casual lunch I always find myself enjoying this great classic. The setting is beautiful as well as the food. Would consider this quite romantic as well for that someone special. Food is always fresh and innovative. Service casual yet refined. ~will c~Phoenix, Arizona
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There is hardly any place more beautiful than the Royal Palms Resort and Spa, and their restaurant, T. Cooks.  It is not inexpensive, but the setting matches the price and you feel like royalty there.  We took 5 adults and 2 infants for Sunday Brunch.  They very kindly set us up with a large table and space so we could maneuver babies, baby seats and other baby stuff.  I appreciate that because we can get up and walk with our granddaughters when they need to be diverted.  The food was outstanding.  Breads, pastries, desserts, salads, cheeses, quiche, crab claws, shrimp,ceviche, there are omelets and waffles cooked to order, and you can get bacon, Italian meats, and much more.  Fresh, correct temperatures and expertly prepared.  Service was very very good.  Attentive, efficient, knowledgable, and kept our coffee hot.  It is very expensive, but is perfect for a special treat.   All the parking is valet.  You are out of your car right up front and through a lovely courtyard into the the restaurant.  I can't wait to go back.~Linda S~Phoenix, Arizona
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This review is long overdue.  We ate at T. Cooks on April 13, 2016.  Over the last few months kept thinking about that night, so I decided to write this review.  Chef Todd Allison made that night's meals unforgettable. His appetizers were unique, his entrees perfectly seasoned and cooked.  There were four of us eating together that night and each of us ordered different food.  Not one of them were disappointing.  Our waiter, Adam, and his crew made sure we were well taken care of.  My only regret is that I have not gone back again.  This holiday season gives me another reason to take my spouse there for another great meal.  I~RogerNDiana~Chandler, Arizona
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed dinner at T.Cooks as part of our stay at the resort. They seated us at a quiet table and we were able to enjoy a lovely dinner together. The food was delicious, including the pumpkin soup, the filet mignon and amazing cheesecake. Our server was charming and very informed on the menu choices. The only downside would be that it was a bit overpriced for the food. But it was delicious and enjoyable!~daisy32386~Fruita, Colorado
T. Cook's~334347~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed the new zealand john dory and the greek style rack of lamb at T Cooks, it is mediterranean cuisine with a twist.  Next visit we have to make room for desert!~natalia64~guadalajara
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beautiful setting and great service. Very high quality ingredients but some courses just had too much going on. Also seemed more expensive then it should have been.  ~momma3foodie~Belvedere, California
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Beautiful setting, thanks to the heaters we were able to sit in the garden....it was wonderful !  I can.t even begin to describe how delicious the food was and the service was impeccable !~vampira527~CONGERS
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything was outstanding.  Our server was incredibly professional. The assisting staff were attentive and helpful.  Overall diverse menu and unique items.  All the items we ordered were exceptional.  This is a gem as well as a great date spot.  ~CoffeenBeers~Baltimore, Maryland
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I could gush about the many aspects that are right about this charming little dining spot, whether you're sitting outside on a nice evening or inside on a cold night. The food is fresh and superb with creative dishes and lovely combinations.  However, it misses the excellent rating for the same food reasons. Fresh is fresh and that means getting the vegetables that are current, whether you like them or not. There is always something on the menu that doesn't appeal to me. I won't be going back with my finicky partner because the extremely limited menu offerings completely dismiss any pickier eaters.   CHECK THE MONTHLY MENU BEFORE MAKING YOUR RESERVATION!!~Scott_A_Drake~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really wanted to give this place five stars, but there were a couple of courses that just missed the mark. My husband and I had been looking forward to coming for months; the restaurant looked adorable in the pictures and did not disappoint in person. There is a beautiful courtyard area outside where I would have loved to dine, unfortunately it was raining so we couldn't take advantage of it. Atmosphere is intimate but bustling at the same time. Take a moment to look at the interesting art on the walls, pretty neat.  We decided to do the chef's 8 course tasting with wine pairing, and settled in assuming we'd be there for at least two hours. It ended up being over a three hour dining experience (which was fine with us) so if you choose this option, be prepared to have a long, leisurely meal.   I won't go into the specifics of each course, just the highs and..not so highs. First and last courses were outstanding-a mushroom arancini ball (could have made a meal out of this) and for dessert we were served house-made chocolate candies and an apple cake with a sorbet. My husband has a nut allergy and they happily accommodated with a pumpkin dessert he loved. We were also served an excellent cheese course as the meal was winding down. Great stuff!   Now for the not so great-we found the pace of the meal to be a little slow in general, but the main issue was the portion sizes were WAY too large for a tasting menu. My husband and I both have pretty hearty appetites, but it was too much food even for us. One course in particular, scallops and oysters in a cream sauce, was HUGE (appetizer-sized like a dip) and just not good; it was an egregious mistake in my opinion that threw off the meal. When you've got great quality seafood, why cover it in cream sauce? We mentioned this to the waitress and the chef actually prepared a pasta dish for us that we much preferred. I felt kind of bad about this but that leads me to another issue; there are four pasta dishes on the dinner menu, but none on the tasting and I wasn't sure why. Tasting menus are supposed to give you a sense of the menu and the chef's skills; I felt a pasta course would have been a little more representative. We did really appreciate that they created this course for us; it speaks to the level of service at this establishment.  The standout here is the service-it is fantastic, some of the best we've ever received at a restaurant. I wish I could remember the names of the people who helped us; our waitress might have been the sweetest and most patient person on the face of the earth, taking her time and answering all of our questions. We could not have asked for more. The sommelier (or he might have been an apprentice of some kind) was engaging and comical, telling us a bit about each wine, and even which courses to save sips of certain wines for. Wines themselves were also excellent, some quirkier selections (wine from New Mexico?) in keeping with the sort of off-beat theme of the restaurant. Nice touch. He is clearly passionate about his craft.  When all is said and done, we had a great time that night and would return to the restaurant, however would most likely order from the cheese and regular dinner menus. FYI-Dinner ended up being around $300 with food and wine pairing.~LeslieAnne7~Baltimore
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a shame it was a rainy night as the beautifully lit garden looked like such a romantic place to dine.   The drink menu was interesting so we decided to try a martini called The Lush. It was a dirty martini with blue cheese olives.  There were four of us for dinner.  We enjoyed a shared appetizers of Mushroom and Snail Toast and Tuna Crudo made with yellowfin tuna.  They were very good.   I had the Seared King Salmon with roasted beets. The salmon was cooked perfect.  The others had Herbed Roasted Prime Rib, Honey-Harissa Glazed Lamb Belly, and Gulf Prawns and Steamed Maine Mussels.  The lamb belly was really good and very rich.  We ordered a side of sweet potatoes & Brussels sprouts and beans & mushrooms to share.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The restaurant approach of farm to table was interesting.  They use a neat combination of herbs, spices and vegetables with each dish. The main course selection is limited but everything was very good.    Service was excellent.~Deborah T~Chicago, Illinois
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's hard for a diner to recover from a food experience gone awry, but management can save face if it's properly handled.  After posting the review Here's the Nitty Gritty, we received a full refund for our meal.  It is commendable and much appreciated.  Note to Management: Had it been done that evening, it would have helped alleviate that bad taste in our mouths (pun intended) and a better rating.~jmgbar~Amelia Island, Florida
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband has been wanting to take me to Talula's for quite some time - for our 26th anniversary we made the time. I happy to say I'd go out of my way to go again. The atmosphere is trendy but not overbearing, inviting but still a bit elegant. We splurged on the chef's tasting - another reviewer did an excellent job of describing the highlights and low lights so I won't repeat but will agree the smoked oyster & scallop dish was the least of the dishes. UNFORTUNATELY I had some kind of reaction to something I ate - not really allergic, but I'm not sure - I didn't get to have my dessert, was afraid I was going to pass out into it :(   But what was amazing - unknown to me, Paul, our main server, noticed and told a manager, Colin, who came and spoke to us. He gave us his card and said he'd call to follow up. He did. I have never been treated with such care at a restaurant (then again I've never had that kind of reaction & hope never to again). While whatever happen put a major damper on the evening I still will not forget the food I did enjoy and the absolutely amazing service not only from Paul and the management (including Nicole) but also the other lovely waitstaff.~lfdb~Philadelphia, PA
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really incredible knowledgable servers who seem to genuinely care about what they do. Great bartender...Cucumber Martini awesome. Known for their cheese plates which did not disappoint.  Really cool decor. ~CharltonDon~Berwyn, Pennsylvania
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sat in the garden for dinner.  It was a nice, peaceful atmosphere. The tables were on top of each other. I personally don't like to hear the conversation of the couple right next to me.  Food was ok. Ordered the lamb belly. Presentation was better than the taste. Fell flat of expectations. Portions were tiny. Drinks were watered down. Service was mediocre.~taaskew~Huntsville, Alabama
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The weather had turned cooler so I assumed we would not be able to experience the garden but I was wrong!  The heaters kept us more than warm enough and it was wonderful to experience the fairy-lit atmosphere of the garden.  Very romantic!  Our waiter was professional, knowledgable and unobtrusive; he kept our meal moving along at just the right pace.  The food was very good and nicely presented (the shiitake mushroom and bean side dish deserves special mention), making excellent use of seasonal ingredients -- lots of apples and squash.  The indoor seating and the bar area also looked very appealing, and we would definitely consider returning on a future trip to Philadelphia.  Enjoy!~CAGreens~US
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my second visit to this intimate, comfortable restaurant hidden in a garden setting around WAshington Sq.  We had the 9 course tasting menu, which changes seasonally and incorporates many different cheeses, their speciality.  It was definitely worth the money (a modest $100/person) and left us feeling comfortably full and pampered. My husband got the extra $50 wine pairing, which included 7 different wines from a sparkling one to 2 dessert wines.  The food and service was outstanding!!  Each course was presented beautifully (but not fussy) and included foie gras, oysters, scallops, duck, lamb and a cheese course, followed by 2 desserts. It is definitely one of our most memorable meals.~Marlene H~Rockville
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We always enjoy their outdoor seating area. The food is good too.  Consequently, we only go there in the nice weather months.~josephshepherd~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have now had two great experiences at Talula's! Start with any of the cheese plates. Don't forget a nice glass of great house wine. Then choose any of the entree's. They are all delicious. Eat outdoors in the great garden space. Finally, enjoy. You will not be disappointed.~Greg Q~Philadelphia, United States
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We reserved a month in advance for a business dinner party of 8. Everyone was completely impressed with the menu which included enough varied selections that everyone in the diverse group could find something mouth watering. We ordered a cheese plate for the table, as well as a fig polenta. Fresh and appealing salads, and a cauliflower soup which was popular. Most people ordered fish and the porgy and salmon were big hits, as were the duck and prime rib. The desserts were creative and delicious. The wine list was also varied and extremely well priced, with a special note that all wines presented were from sustainable vineyards. The service was very friendly yet unobtrusive, and all orders were presented correctly, as requested - no small feat. We were glad to have selected Talula's Garden for this gathering: We'd been here before and will definitely be back.~nydolly~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While in town for a weekend getaway with my wife, we had a lovely experience at this restaurant.   My wife and I head to Philly alot from NYC for similar trips, and I come to Philly often for business, and Talula's is my favorite place and my wife became a big fan.     Great, warm service.  Great options for food - and with being able to split the pastas in half portions, you can explore the menu more than you would at other places.    We only wish we could have eaten outside on what was a lovely evening weather wise, but didnt want to wait 20-30 mins.  But this is one of Philly's finest restaurants.~petertom25~Bayside, New York
Talula's Garden~2137068~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~was here for dinner and what a great experience.! a little pricey but worth it! sat outside in the garden which is just very classy! the menu is very diverse and most interesting! and the staff could not do enough for you! they were also very knowlegable about every item and all ingredients on their menu!  my wife was just amazed at this place. i would say you must try it even for a cocktail and one of their cheese trays. had a cheese tray for a starter with cocktails and it was so amazing! don't miss this one! and please try one of the desserts.~tmulholland7~Levittown, Pennsylvania
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~All the dishes we tried were excellent,  friendly service and fast attention. The ceviches were all excellent, the grilled octopus and the cocktails also very good.~eridaniaalvarez~Santo Domingo
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here for my husband's birthday.  It was a fun and different vibe.  The cocktails were super funa nd different.  I had the Pisco Punch which was very good.  We ordered quite a few appetizers.  They were good but no standouts.  For fun we tried the beef heart and it was tough and not very tasty.  The entrees were amazing (thus the 5 stars).  We ordered the lan=mb, short ribs, fried rice, stir fry and Plancha Marina.  I had a taste of everything and it was outstanding.  The short ribs that I ordered were possibly the best meal I have eaten in Chicago in a very long time!!!  They were mouth watering!  Our waitress was terrific!  They brought a dessert with a candle for my husband.  That was very sweet.  Overall, quite a taste treat.  I highly recommend this restaurant:-)~xboox~Geneva, Illinois
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent ceviche and empanadas. Great pisco sour, of course. Delightful server. Music was a little loud/ pounding.~Ricardo194~San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~From the cocktails to the choice in menu to the service this was an amazing experience what a fun day ~TraceyShades~Ubud, Indonesia
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at this Peruvian restaurant. The interior is trendy and filled with upscale references to Peru. The menu was eclectic and featured tapas, apps, and main entrees. Prices were   moderate. My cocktail, La Rusa, was excellent and well-balanced. My entree of the pork fried rice was delicious. They can accommodate a gluten-free diet. My colleague had an Argentinian red wine and the short rib entree and loved both. Our server (I think her name was Victoria) was highly attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. The portions were large - I wasn't able to put much of a dent in my entree. Since I was staying in a hotel, I did not take home the leftovers. As a result, the chef sent our server back to see if everything was ok. This showed me that he or she took pride in their cuisine. Enjoyable experience!~FaithNY~New York
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was hesitant to go for Peruvian food but Tanta did not disappoint. Lots of steak, seafood and Asian themed items on the menu. The tuna ceviche was amazing. All of the food was really good and the craft cocktails were delicious. Great wine list and service too. Definitely check it out!~Ramesh V~Chicago, Illinois
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been a fan of Peruvian cuisine ever since I visited the country. Since then I've been trying to find good Peruvian restaurants in the States and I think it's safe to say that Tanta is one such restaurant.   I had the ceviche Classico as a starter. As starters go, it was adequate portion size but was served without the chopped cayenne peppers which are a signature of the dish in Lima.   Next we all sampled a corn cake (pastel fel chocolo) that another in our party had ordered. And it was "wow" delicious. The dish was made vegetarian and taste is indescribable! If I go back to Chicay,I definitely going back to this restaurant just for this.   I had the lamb shank which was served in a bed of polenta with fried kale-another winner. However next time, I'm trying their lomo saltada.   The place is a bit noisy but the service is superb. We waited at the bar as we were early, but they worked with us to get as an early table. Their pisco sour, which I had while I waited also was superb.   All in all, I highly recommend it! ~AvidTraveller2011~Farmington, Pennsylvania
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loud, fun, and food way beyond expectations. My estofado de cordero (braised lamb shank, I think) was meaty, fall-off-the-bone deliciousness. Combine that with a perfect pisco sour and you are in culinary heaven. Mmm hmm. ~Stephen J~Greenwich, Connecticut
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My family and I ate Gaston Acurio's Tanta restaurant this afternoon and was impressed with the flavor of the food and the service.  I would highly the pollo a la brasa, the ceviche, and the empanadas.  Try washing it down with a pisco sour or two, but be careful, they are quite high in alcohol.  Overall, an excellent meal.~Viking-travels~Kansas City, Missouri
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Never had Peruvian food before and I really enjoyed it . The staff is very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend ~Bibiya~kent
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our server, Becky, did an outstanding job of explaining the menu and guiding our choices. We did a couple of rounds of the small plates and everything was outstanding. Love this place!~elainejr~Barrington, Illinois
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tanta was our first experience with Peruvian food and it definitely exceeded our expectations.  Overall the atmosphere was lively, the service was attentive and the food flavors were fabulous.  We had a large group (7) which allowed us to try a wide variety of dishes from all areas of the menu and share them.  We had a recommendation to try the ceviche and both selections were terrific.  Our waiter suggested the octopus and it was perfectly prepared.  We also loved the potato creations (especially the one topped with tuna) which melted in our mouths.  Everything from the seafood to the short ribs was just delicious.  Highly recommended!~Sue B~Cincinnati, Ohio
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Peruvian Cebiche is a treasure to behold, Tanta's take on it is amazing! Sit at the Cebiche bar and watch a chef create your succulent dish. You must try the pisco sour and for an even more flavorful twist try the spicy el chingon. Great roof top to hang out when the weather is nice.~Ryan Q~Chicago, Illinois
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The venue is hip and fresh. Nice menu, featuring Peruvian offerings. They have Japanese, Cantonese and other cuisines presented with a Peruvian flair. The pork fried rice with shrimp and egg had a paella quality and was fantastic, as we the grilled octopus and several beef dishes. Try a pesco sour....great evening....excellent service..valet parking.~Richard J~Baltimore, Maryland
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Three of went here for an impromptu dinner and found the restaurant to be interesting, the service excellent and the food fantastic and well presented.~hanlievanwyk~Chicago, Illinois
Tanta~4717714~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We recently spent time in Peru so decided to have lunch in Chicago at a Peruvian restaurant.   Tanta stays true to its roots.   No Cuy was available but the empanadas were excellent.  Beef cheeks were flavourful and tender  The chicken was juicy, tender, and flavourful.   Pork belly on waffle was an unexpected treat.  Definitely recommended~pstover~Green Bay, Wisconsin
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great authentic Mexican food reasonably priced. The music is a bit loud, but hey, it makes you feel like you're actually in a cantina in Mexico....with better music and obviously not as loud. Pretty small inside and seating is a bit cramped, but not bad. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but you can grab a beer and converse with your friends while you wait. No parking that I'm aware of but its JC so no surprise. ~JayUlrich~Jersey City, New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Taqueria Downtown a few times and the taste of the food has dropped considerably, the food here tasted great before but it has been inconsistent for a while now, I love the place but food has to have taste and Taqueria Downtown has lost it. Overall, the crowd and the ambient makes it worth a trip but you can find better Mexican food at other restaurants in the area.~Miguel M~New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been to Taqueria's other location before, which is just takeout/catering and I really enjoyed it. My only gripe about that location is that by the time you bring it home, or by the time it's delivered, everything is soggy already.  The solution is to come to their dine-in location! My boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday at around 7ish. There was a wait but it was only for the outdoor seating in the back. If you don't mind sitting inside on a nice day, then you might be immediately seated.  I ordered my usual - fish tacos and the chorizo quesadilla and since it was eaten fresh, it was of course better than its sister location. He ordered the Cecina Plato (salt-cured flank steak with chilaquiles). I hated it. I'm not sure what the dish is supposed to taste like but the beef was just an abnormally flat piece of beef that had no flavor whatsoever - just salt. My boyfriend liked it though. I on the other hand am glad I did not order that.  The margaritas (tad pricy at $9) aren't really that strong. Instead, try a michelada ($6), which taste like a bloody mary made with a Corona instead of vodka. Wikipedia had me thinking I wouldn't like it but I actually did! It's not as heavy as a bloody mary but you still get all the flavor of one.  Will definitely be back for when I'm craving tacos but don't feel like ordering soggy ones.~Melanie T~New York City, New York
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My 8 year old and I finally decided to give Taqueria a go one while hubby/daddy was away.  On the hottest Friday in July, we arrived around 4:30 and were seated immediately. There is a small patio, but trust that was NOT an option at 95 degrees.   It was noticeably sticky in the restaurant with its low ceilings and zero breeze.   The menu is fairly priced (although instituting happy hour could knock a few dollars of the $8 margarita price).  The chips and salsa are good - not greasy with a good crunch. We decided on the steak with onions and a fish taco.   First the fish taco...smothered in stuff and cold. Moving on.  The steak was nicely portioned and served with yellow rice (just ok) and what was supposed to be beans-but was more like bean juice. No. Literally. 4. beans. And Bean juice.  Please use the facilities before you arrive. Small and crammed doesn't begin to describe it.  Taqueria is best served for the young local transplants. In our single pre-child days, we probably would have called this place home. But for now we'll just pass it by, wave and take ourselves elsewhere when Hubby/Daddy is away on business. ~TravelsMyMidleName~North Jersey/NY
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My sister and I had meat and fish tacos and they were amazing.  Would recommend this place if you like hot and spicy Mexican food. ~gvale917~New Brunswick, New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice outdoor patio - a little quieter than sitting indoors where the music is really loud. It also has good shade and the fences keep out the breezes so it is probably nice out there even when it cools down.  The fish, steak, chorizo and carnitas tacos were tasty. The corn tortillas used are very thin and have very little corn flavor - not enough corn flavor for me. Also the onions were not that strongly flavored either - I prefer to really taste them.  The refried beans were a nice soft consistency, however they needed more flavor - maybe just salt. The rice was standard yellow - not a lot of flavor.  The do not offer any NA beers...really?  ~ouilv2travel~Chicago, IL
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of my favorite hole in the walls! Tacos, Margheritas and enchiladas were awesome as always. Service is always good. ~Justin Y~Port Monmouth, New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ordered the steak, chorizo and stomach tacos, for a to-go order, and was not disappointed!  More than adequate meat, salsa, hot sauce, onions and radishes inside each of them.  At $3 each, it was a great value for price paid.  Customer service was prompt and friendly, and were accommodating when I asked for secure packaging since I was travelling back home, which was on the other side of town.  They have other menu items on board, and will definitely try them next time I visit.  A must try!~Mike M~Jersey City, New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our first visit was for lunch on a Friday.  The daily special was chile rellenos for $11.95.  Wow what a big plate that had 2 chile rellenos, beans, rice and tortillas.  I shared half of it with other family members who ordered various tacos which were also fantastic.  The place was very crowded inside so we sat out in the patio area which was better than inside.  A must place for anyone who likes authentic Mexican food.  They do not have "Taco Tuesdays" anymore.~garyDallas_Tx~Dallas, Tx
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really like Taqueria Downtown.  Great Tacos and reasonably priced for the quality. Homemade taste!  Very popular with a line outside very often! ~Licillevagabond~Jersey City, New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This spot has been around for years and it's still packed. Real deal mexican at bargin prices. Very traditional drink menu: beer,sangria and a margarita.That's all there is and all you need. Excellent assortment of street tacos and killer tamales. Good guac, chips and salsa.Nice outdoor patio in the back. This place is the perfect "dive"and I say that in the very best way.~Joel G~Jersey City, New Jersey
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great change. Tamales and Victoria beer. Feel like I'm in Cabo! I will be back ofte. Definitely give it a try.~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Taqueria Downtown~944687~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~what a fun place! Great food, great beers, and a fun place to hang out. a must go. try it and you will like it~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A little crowded, had to wait in line, but it's worth it! We went there for breakfast, they have a variety of menu options, but I always get the egg sandwich! Great decor too!~crisp503~Portland, Oregon
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After trying to eat here on 3 previous occasions just to see if the hype was all it was made out to be, we decided to stick it out for the 1-1.5 hour wait time on Sunday at 9 am.  We put our name down and agreed, we had to stick it out because it was not raining out and was beautiful in Portland. When we were finally called, we had made our decisions for food and decided to try a variety of items. 1. the donut was a dry chocolate cake donut hole in a soup.  Joe's donuts are better in Sandy, Oregon. 2. the coffee cake was warm and good, but once the warmth was gone, it was just a dry piece of coffee cake.  I will stick with my recipe. 3. My coffee was good, stayed hot but came at an odd time in the meal. 4. Mimosa was just that and my bloody mary, may have had vodka???? 5. the hash was ok, but was SALTY, and the egg was perfectly cooked, however the broccolini which was listed was 2 small sprigs (if that) and essentially fried to a point of being a chip.  Lots of grease and really nothing to rave about. Sausage was SALTY. 6. The flatbread was probably the best thing we had but needed more cheese to get the full effect of the arugula.   I like the egg on top. 7.  The French toast came way late and was just French bread (nothing special) with thick syrup but no pear hint as promised. Our overall thought was DON'T WASTE your morning waiting.  The kitchen staff and prep staff don't seem very happy.  The wait staff seemed ok, but I have to ask for more coffee.  I do not think it holds up to the hype and definitely NOT THE WAIT.   Too much salt and not enough WOW.  The environment is one where you want to be seen but if you are not "HIP", they are not terribly friendly.   Also, very loud, we sat at the small window facing table by the bar which helped with the sound.   SAVE your time and money, I will not be back.  Should have listened to my hunch.  Maybe they need to take reservations.  So many people heard wait time of 2 -3 hours and just went on with their morning.~skirafthike~Sandy, Oregon, United States
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Be ready for a gastronomic adventure of exemplary proportions. I really enjoy sitting at the bar and talking to restauranteurs from around the world. One time I had the salmon, a simple dish, but they really brought out every flavor. And their desserts? Goodness, they have re-invented every sweet flavor under the sun and brought it to new levels.~dalebA4936XF~Seattle, Washington
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was visiting a friend in Portland and we walked in and had a 1/2 hour wait but found a place at the bar and decided to stay put there. Our bartender was great. I had whiskey sours and they were spot on. Dinner was delish. Our neighbor insisted I try his stuff dumpling and I did and it was terrific. I love Scallops and they were cooked perfect and complimented with a tasty sauce. My friend had Wagyu Beef. It was so tender. We had a bunch of sides that didn't disappoint. The ambience also made it so cool. Next trip to Portland this and it's sister restaurant will be on my radar...~traveler07577~West Palm Beach, Florida
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not like this place needs my positive review...We tried to order some of the more bizarre foods we'd never make at home, and we were super pleased! It's difficult to impress me when it comes to brunch food because I hate & refuse to spend $12 on an omelet with some veggies when I could make that in 10 minutes at home. The lemon ricotta pancake was good, but that wasn't our favorite. Potatoes Bravas was incredible, we got the small, it was plenty! The bim bop bacon & eggs was delicious as well. Wish we could've tried more but I'm glad we only ordered those three things because that was more than enough for my boyfriend and I. Add on a couple of mimosas and you're at $60 though! Overall, I'd go back if I'm ever in Portland. Because of the prices, I wouldn't make this a regular trip if I lived there, but definitely for special occasions.~Ellen P~Vienna, Virginia
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Saturday morning (okay, afternoon) brunch here requires a bit of patience due to the somewhat long wait for a table.  Once seated, waitress quickly reviews our choices and we're off!  Started with a chocolate malt milk shake with fries ... don't knock it 'til you try it!  A little hair 'o the dog with a Tasty Mary.  One order of french toast and another of fried egg, cheddar biscuit with their house-made sausage.  We each eat half and switch.  Tasty!  A bit noisy, so not a place to expect intimacy.  Enjoyed it so much, went back a few days later (solo this time) and thoroughly enjoyed the Polenta n Sugo (polenta, mozzarella, over easy egg).~DandLtravel~Burbank, California
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Showed up here on a rainy Thursday afternoon. Everyone we encountered from the host, to the bartender to the servers were all very helpful and friendly. We shared three dishes that were all full of flavor. We started with the Saigon Brussels Sprouts - sweet and salty and crunchy and just perfect. Next we shared the Breakfast Flatbread "con amor" - egg. pancetta. caramelized onion. calabrian chili. truffled potato cream - again, bright and interesting flavors and perfectly cooked flatbread. Finished off with the pork schnitzel - sunny side up egg. ham. havarti. mustard braised cabbage. The cabbage was so good! Our only (minor) complaint was that the pork seemed over salted - but still there were many tasty flavors to make us happy! There were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try - just not enough room in our stomachs! I doubt you could go wrong here!~Michelle B~Shoreline, Washington, United States
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Started with the Tasty Mary's - a delicious twist on an old fav that had tomato juice, siracha, horseradish, and vodka with very good garnishes (pickled mushroom, okra, beet). All working together for a great brunch cocktail!  Had the Bim Bop, with crispy rice, kimchi, bacon, spinach, carrots, and eggs in a bowl that you mix together when served.  Hints of ginger and pepper with these ingredients made for a savory treat!  For this dish alone, I would return! Had 2 other dishes - the sausage links and the breakfast flatbread, both were good. ~Joy G~Durham, North Carolina
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere was great, as was the service and the food.  We enjoyed the truffled fries and dessert the most.  ~alexespo5~Saratoga Springs, New York
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a popular restaurant in downtown Portland.  It is a moderate size, has rather open seating, and handles as many people as possible...do NOT expect a private meal!  Having said that, the choices were varied and unusual,  The drinks and food were very good.  The staff and service was good.  We sampled many small plates and were satisfied with everything! One recommendation - get there slightly before opening (first come, first seated) or expect to put your name on a waiting list (for 60+ minutes). At least you can wander around the area while you wait. It is worth the trouble!~Traveldog86~West Virginia
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is outstanding. Epic food, great atmosphere and awesome service. We sat at the bar and the bartender Madison took such good care of us. She always has the most amazing smile on her face and gave us a classy experience. We had the Northwest Migas which were mind-blowing. The Radicchio salad which was superb. The Bi Bim Bap Bacon n Egg bowl which stole my heart. And last but not least the Chocolate Potato Doughnut which was a nugget of heaven. We loved this place in every way and we dream of going back soon!!!~knowzwhatsup~Los Angeles, California
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my second visit and the food was amazing as always.  I ordered the halibut sandwich which just falls apart on the yummy bun with lettuce and house sauce.  Wait times can vary between 30-90 minutes but it's so worth the wait.  The French fries are seasoned well but this was my second visit and did not like them again as they way over cooked and very hard so they should try improve the fries.  Staff are friendly enough and it has a good ambiance this location.  ~Eireboi~San Francisco, California
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got in line prior to the 9am opening, once the doors opened we were seated promptly. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and intent upon making sure the experience is positive. We asked the server for suggestions and they were perfect. Sweet, salty and spicy-great way to go.~Nancy A~Cary,Illinois
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a great meal September 2016. Sat at the bar...very well stocked by the way...Salmon and skirt steak. Lively, fun place. Very nice menu.  Had to try the blue potato doughnuts for dessert...outstanding!~ACO2019~Tucson, Arizona
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We thought we would eat at the food trucks that are nearby the restaurant but the weather was raining and chilly so we decided to sit inside and knew this restaurant had great reviews.  When we first looked at the menu it was hard to decide because everything sounded a little odd and it was not clear how the dishes were made but our fabulous waitress Natalie did an expert job describing the plates. I had the pork schnitzel with ham and melted cheese and a fried egg with a side of the braised cabbage that I really need the recipe for.  It was amazing, I could have licked the plate.  My friend had the fried chicken on rice spicy bbq sauce and Kimchi and was also very happy with her meal.  If you want to try something different this is the place~karenweber~Northern California
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went to Tasty N' Alder at the recommendation of friends.  The wait was an hour when we arrived for lunch on a Friday, so we wandered around downtown until they called us.  The food was well worth the wait.  Unusual takes on traditional dishes - we had the Bim Bop Bacon and Eggs and the Hangtown Fry.  Be sure to have the Doughnut too.~Hockeydad900~La Canada Flintridge, California
Tasty n Alder~3963126~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When there based on other reviews, planned to sit for dinner alone at the bar but ran int colleagues from work.  Dinner was great, starting with service, appetizers, main courses and red wine suggestions.  Hopping and fun place, well worth going!~Opher~Zichron Yaakov, Israel
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious meal and the service was excellent. We had ample time to make the show but did not feel rushed. Half portions of pasta were available.The food was fresh, swordfish was especially good. The seating was a bit close, however. Would definitely return.Quite busy for a Tuesday night. A reservation was helpful.~jamaplus~Worcester, Massachusetts
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a wonderful midnight meal at Teatro after seeing "An American in Paris". A quick search for "theatre district restaurants" gave me the names of 5 locations in walking distance.  We lucked out and picked Teatro.  The hostess seated us in a cozy corner. The waitstaff was very attentive.  The late hour made small plate choices a good option. We split an excellent Caesar salad; my husband had the Funghi pizza with a crispy thin crust and I chose the the polenta with braised duck, marsala & wild mushroom. Everything is cooked to order. The atmosphere is tasteful and fun. I would definitely dine here again.~CaliforniaGirl500~North Conway, New Hampshire
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I rate this restaurant a 4 of 5. Our food was very good. We were seated without a reservation. Our service was excellent. It is very loud and busy. My friends side salad with romaine was nothing to write home about and not worth the price.  Her meal of pasta and wild mushrooms was excellent as was mine, a chicken dish. I would go back for sure. ~Linda K~Springfield, Massachusetts
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I think this is my 6th visit in the past few years to Teatro. I love the vibe this place has. The decor is very cool and the staff is very attentive. The place does not lend itself to engaging the staff or to a larger group conversation. It is a little loud and best kept with a twosome, or at most a foursome. The pastas are excellent! The oricchiette is the best and the scampi a close second. I will most assuredly be back. ~Smillerick~Concord, New Hampshire
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In Boston for 4 days.  Enjoyed the food some much we have had dinner here twice.  Shrimp, salmon, lobster, chicken , pizza were all great.  Very accommodating for changing sides.  Desserts were terrific.  Loved the service also  ~D A B~Temple City, California
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Let me start out by saying the food was absolutely amazing. With that out of the way, the service was absolutely terrible. This was the first time I've ever tipped 10% in my life. The server acted as tho we were an inconvenience from the start when we arrived 90 minutes before closing to a full restaurant. We said we wanted water to start while looking at wine menu and it was all down hill from there. He never asked if we had any questions about the menu when half of it is in Italian and there are two prices next to the pasta. He didn't ask what portion size we wanted, so I'm pretty certain he charged us full portion size for half portion size. I asked him what wine would pair well with the spinach ravioli because it didn't say what type of sauce and he recommended reds for a white sauce. He didn't tell us about any specials. He walked away while we were ordering dessert. Overall this guy was absolutely terrible. As the title says, 5 star food with 1 star service. ~Ryon M~Goldsboro
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great little pasta restaurant in a cool little building. The food is excellent and the staff were very good but my god is it noisy in here! Don't let that put you off (if you are after a quiet romantic meal then its not for you anyway) because the conversations being had all around us were very entertaining, made us feel like we were in a Boston soap opera! Good cocktails (Dark n Stormy was OK but not enough Ginger Ale in it, wife's margarita was very good) and the atmosphere was very good. Great view of the ark outside from the bar.~BarryW1970~Chester, United Kingdom
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant was recommended by our hotel as a place to eat at after a concert.  We received great service from the moment we walked in, and the food was terrific.  I started with the burrata and moved on to the night's special of spaghetti carbonara, which was made according to the classic recipe.  Delicious!  My husband had a good salad and then braised duck with polenta (on the appetizer menu but big enough for a main course).  We will definitely come again.~DobeWatson~Northampton, Massachusetts
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Time and time again, whenever we visit this wonderful restaurant we are never disappointed! Julia, the manager, is so professional and accommodating! From the Caesar salad and then  the meatball appetizer(beef and Foie Gras) to the Chicken Milanese all excellently prepared! Don't  forget the pizza selection and make sure you get an order of the rosemary sea salt fries! The desert selection is above par, don't forget to pick one!~denbro~Brookline, MA
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Want good service and great food?   This is a great find in the theater district in Boston.  The service was well above average and the food exceeded my expectations.  The best aspect was I got it my way and not "that's the way it comes."   This is not a big chain! ~Ed S~Portland, Oregon
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a special night it was my wife's birthday. I had been to an affair that the restaurant had catered and the food was great. Friends had also raved about the food. The night was a very rainy night so the valet parking worked out $21 but I guess that is average for the city. We had a reservation, and were taken right on time which is a great thing. Our waiter was very pleasant did not rush us at all,  even though a lot of people were going to shows that night. the food did not disappoint I had the Swordfish and my wife had the scallops my portion was one of the biggest I have seen. We had two apps. a shrimp dish and the mussels. The mussels were served out of shells and the sauce was delicious, dipping the bread in the sauce was the best. The prices were less than I expected. The only slight drawback was that being an old building the restaurant was noisy when we got there but as the evening went by it got quieter.~Kenny327~Watertown, Massachusetts
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a very good antipasto. Fantastic veal and ribeye.The dessert was fien as well. Price reasonable. Service is good. The only minus point is that it is very noisy.~Hans_10~Helmond, The Netherlands
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We reserved this restaurant according to the good reviews. When walking in the restaurant, the noise level was already hit us so hard.  After we sit down, we even could not hear each other by yelling to each other.  We decided that this was not a place to have enjoyable dinner and stood up to leave.  When you can't talk to each other at the table, what is the reason to go out for dinner.  This restaurant definitely not for romantic, business purpose.~TRventure~San Francisco
Teatro Restaurant~321934~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~With so many places to choose from in Boston it's hard to be sure you have the right place but there's no doubt Teatro is worth a visit.  From the bread to the pizzas and the gnocchi it is all delicious. Add in their half portion sizes, great service from the staff and a good atmosphere you can see why it is so popular. I loved the panna cotta!~Ruth J~London, United Kingdom
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a not so great meal at Roses we walked down the street into Ted's to sit at the bar for a half a piece of mile high chocolate cream pie and coffee between to folks and ate the other half the next evening. What great pie and we took home a salted Carmel pop tart they made there. The green marble bar and great service saved the evening. ~rogersober~Clermont, Florida
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I always enjoy eating here.  The food is excellent and I have never had anything I didn't like.  This latest visit I had the Biscuits and Gravy and it was delicious.  The service was excellent as always.~TravelingJohnB80~Martinsburg, West Virginia
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I came here for a business lunch and was impressed with the food and the service.  They offer a good selection of American comfort foods.  I would definitely come back again.~Bryan B~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had read good things about Ted's Bulletin, so made the trip with the family from Georgetown. It was well worth it. Three kids and two adults were very happy with their breakfasts. My French toast, eggs, bacon and hash browns we're delicious - cooked exactly right. A real American treat.  The kids also loved the blueberry cheesecake and strawberry pop tarts, a Ted's specialty.  Service from Chris our waiter was spot on.  Highly recommended!~MagicRoundabout~London, United Kingdom
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just had the "Mark on an off day" and a mocha.  I found both pretty unremarkable and thought that this place is generally overrated.  In fairness, I took my breakfast to go so I could eat on the Capitol lawn - so perhaps it'd have been better piping hot and dining in. Regardless, the mocha was fine, but Starbucks is better.  The food seemed marginally above average, but certainly nothing worth going out of your way for.  The nicest thing about the place seemed to be the atmosphere - it seemed like a really nice environment to have breakfast with family or friends - perhaps why there was a decent wait for a table.~Shannone J~Boston, Massachusetts
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Met local friends here when visiting town and staying in the Capitol Hill neighborhood - this was a highlight.  Tried the 'adult' pumpkin bourbon milkshake and it was AMAZING. I had the tomato soup and grilled cheese with bacon and my friend had the peanut butter bacon burger - we were all very satisfied with our food and the service.  Reasonable prices.  Also have some awesome looking desserts that we didn't have space for after the milkshakes, and I also heard their breakfast and home-made pop tarts are pretty awesome. Would definitely come back her when in the city in the future!~jknd02~Toledo, Ohio
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My companion and I had breakfast here on our way to downtown and it was a terrific experience. Decor is 50-60s chic and the wait staff is great. Food is a tad pricey, but excellent. I recommend this place...lots of atmosphere.~SuzanneCloud~Collingswood, New Jersey
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I visited a friend in DC and we came here twice--once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both meals were so good! I highly recommend getting Ted's Tarts, as they are homemade Pop Tarts. Brown cinnamon sugar was my favorite! I also loved the short rib sandwich. Definitely a stop worth making in DC!~Jaclyn B~Phoenix, Arizona
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~OMG! When to Ted's for a late night dessert to cap off a great night on U Street. There were 4 staff at the bakery counter and none could explain what the bake goods were. They didn't even know the flavor of the one and only daily donut hole and had to take one to the manager to ask. With 10 minutes until they close, you would think they would just sample it because I'm sure (or hope) that they were going to toss after they closed. Bad service ruins good restaurants.~busy_traveler~Chicago
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the cheese burgers I've had in a long time, and the carrot cake is a meal on it's own. Would recommend it to all for a nice easy place to eat out..~glenn944~Belfast, United Kingdom
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pleasant ambiance, good food (I had the pot roast) , cheerful service, reasonable bill. What's not to like?~MikeHeilbron~London, United Kingdom
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Seriously the best breakfast I've ever had. I had the walk of shame burrito and my husband had steak and eggs. My burrito was stuffed with sausage, egg, and cheese and topped with green chili sauce and avacado. It was the most delicious breakfast burrito I've ever had. Our service was prompt and friendly. I loved that the waitress left the coffee carafe with us. Also, the cream was contained in chilled metal servers that kept it cool. All the details were spot on. If I lived here I would be a regular. ~Aubrey O~Olney, Illinois
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sitting on the wide sidewalk watching the people go by is a delight especially when you have great coffee, a glass of delicious orange juice and are tucking into a fabulous Crab Cake Benedict or the TUBS (which may just be too much food).  Then when you top it all off with great service and a freshly made Pop-Tart, well then you may be in brunch heaven.  I only perused the dining room on the way to the spic-n-span ladies room but I was glad we ate outside; the DR seemed loud.  The decor is lots of fun but I liked our leisurely dining outside.  I would go back to Ted's anytime.  It was that good.~Amy C~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The adult shakes are amazing and big enough to share 2 or even 3 ways. The peanut butter cake is scrumptious! The banana cream pie was the most disappointing, so I would not recommend it. But everything else was super delicious. ~movtcharova~St. Petersburg, Florida
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The all day breakfast menu and a robust and an interesting lunch/dinner menu provide a great selection of tasty food.  Milkshakes are old style and tasty with some traditional and some uncommon flavors. Portions are huge, so order with restraint unless you want to take some home~Frank C~Portland, Oregon
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We made the hike from Capital Hill to this place on a Friday night. It was a walk, but fun to go through the various neighborhoods. The restaurant itself is a throwback. We had a drink at the bar (they had PBR on tap!!!) before being seated in a booth. I ordered the pot roast and it was perfect. Very savory and a decent portion. We also ordered a homemade poptart, which is like a sugar cookie stuff with jam - very good. It's definitely a fun place to visit. ~Googlaw26~Escondido, California
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were thrilled to find this little treasure within walking distance of where we were staying for a brief (2 day) visit to DC.  The food was good and there was plenty of it.  The staff were friendly and made us feel very welcome.  We are from Wisconsin and I had on a Packer hat.  Several staff came over to talk about their visits to Wisconsin and the midwest.  We ate there for two dinners and two breakfasts.  We will definitely return. ~Mary Lu A~Madison, Wisconsin
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wonderful breakfast! French toast, eggs, fruit and homemade pop tarts! We took some to go. Kristin, our waitress, was super friendly and made sure we were having fun! Nice ending to a convention we attended. ~ShellConcha~Framingham, Massachusetts
Ted's Bulletin~1770090~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You really do have to go here if you're in DC. We had breakfast and supper there in the same day- no apologies from us!   Please have an adults milkshake, they are quite something. Or have the caramel macchiato one if you're off the booze, equally amazing. You also need to have the chilli- we shared a cup of it to start and it was super tasty. We followed it with a burger which was incredible!  They say to try the pop tarts when in Ted's but we weren't massive fans, I think we aren't used to them in the UK as they are really sweet but they were fun nonetheless.  Our waiter, Sam, was awesome. So friendly and helpful and genuinely charming. He also kindly gave us pop tarts to take away! Thanks Sam (and cheers to Ted!). We will be back!  ~FranS84~London, United Kingdom
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After dinner at the Commissary we stopped at Ted's for some dessert, yum the Milkshakes were perfect. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing Milkshakes. ~VACNUT~Michigan
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cool atmosphere, good food and super friendly staff. Went for the TUBS, was satisfied. Eat here, start your day strong :)~Filip D~Zagreb, Croatia
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Head to B's for authentic American diner experience. Plates are big (at last the American sized portions we were lead to expect) great service (Kenneth) clean, real test filling food. Killer shakes. ~Matthew F~Burgos, Spain
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Horrible experience, tried to call in a reservation and was told they only do call ahead seating. Called ahead as requested an hour before arrival, got there and they told me it would be an hour and half wait. Similar size party walked in off the streets and was giving the same time frame which means their call head was bogus and just away of getting you in. It's horrible when a successful restaurant feels the need to LIE to get you in. I will never go there again.~Tbabyjim~Miami, Florida
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had a breakfast omelet and a tart. My friend had the biscuits and gravy. Never had biscuits and gravy that tasted so authentic. It tasted like my grandma made them. The breakfast omelet was so fresh~James W~Destin, Florida, USA
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I just had breakfast here today.  The food and service were excellent. They also have a pastry area that looked amazing.  Next time in DC, we will be back.~Mitch M~Owasso, Oklahoma, United States
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ted's Bulletin never fails.  This was my 3rd visit there in two years.  It's always good.  We go for the "adult milkshakes" . and stay for the food.  I love the White Russian shake but for those with expensive taste, my brother loves the millionaire's milk shake.  There is was a big group of us (11) but even though the place was nearly besides us they couldn't get us in and out.  Our server was very nice.  When we got there we informed the manager that we had a little more than an hour.  He assured us that we would get out in that time.  I believe we did but only because we got a little pushy (we were trying to catch a flight back home.) . Besides a slightly slow kitchen, this place rocks! The two previous times I went, once was with a group of about 10 and the second time only two and things were much better with the two than the 10 so I think they just can't handle the groups.  With all that being said, I would go again and maybe even with a group. We can't help it that we're a big family lol. ~gray75~chicago
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thank you, Trip Advisor for steering us to this restaurant on Friday night. Awesome ambiance ( friendly, happy, retro), wonderful service, and delicious food ( no frills, just good).  Diner menu, and you can order breakfast anytime, with shakes and cake....... oh my. Family friendly place, but nice quiet booths, too. Watch I Love Lucy on the big screen while you finishing off desert.~cindypicard~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was great and service was excellent.  I had the biscuits and gravy and they were some of the best I have had anywhere.  I also LOVE their tater tots and always get them when I eat here.~TravelingJohnB80~Martinsburg, West Virginia
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We spent a weekend in the city and woke up pretty early on a Sunday looking for a good and affordable breakfast restaurant.  Our hotel front desk staff recommended Ted's Bulletin and it did not disappoint.   Very nice restaurant with excellent  food, atmosphere and nice restaurant staff. The restaurant is modern, yet makes you feel as though you are entering into the 1950's. They played I love Lucy on the televisions and have a bakery as well.  Absolutely spectacular!  We both had nanas beer biscuits and gravy, which was super delicious.  We will definitely return! Thank you to Dwon for the great service!~froggiesmooch~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were hoping to pop in for a quick lunch before some more sightseeing. Unfortunately, we waited over 45 minutes to be given a table. The quality of food was good and so was the service but the long wait put me in a terrible mood and didn't set a good tone for the rest of the visit.~ecca95~York, United Kingdom
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were on vacation in the DC area and were looking for an interesting place to dine.  We did some research and ran across Ted's Bulletin.  The reviews were great on several different websites.  We knew we had to try it.  We walked from our hotel which was in the downtown area and found Ted's to be situated in an area that had more of a neighborhood feel than a city feel.  The sign and the entrance automatically gives you the impression that this place is going to be as much about the experience as it's going to be about the food.  I loved everything about it.  It was warm and welcoming with a really cool throwback vibe.  It instantly looked familiar.  Lots of wooden booths, tile floors, a bar area, a bakery section, and an open kitchen.    We arrived about 9:45 am on a Thursday morning and were seated immediately.  The staff were very friendly and took our order quickly.  The menu has some great choices.  I was hungry and knew that we were all set for a full day of sightseeing, so I selected the steak and eggs...three sunny side up eggs, a big portion of hash browns, and a nice 10 oz steak was included along with some flavored butters to spread on the steak.  It was a huge breakfast, but I managed to eat it all.  I asked for medium rare and that's exactly what I got.  I had a nice hot cup of strong coffee to go with my meal and a full carafe was left on the table oo I could pour another cup or two if I so desired.  I took a peek at the lunch and dinner offerings and was sad that I would not have another opportunity to eat here because I already had dinner reservations and was leaving the next morning.  This is a terrific place to eat and I would not hesitate to come back again.  Fantastic menu, great ambience, excellent value, and terrific service.  What's not to love?~Michie1291~Greenfield, Massachusetts
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went with my family to DC to visit one of my Daughters who is a college Freshman. Her RA recommended Ted's. It looks like the building might have been a bank in a former life.   We were here for Sunday Brunch. It's an interesting cross between a bakery & a restaurant. We had a 45 minute wait, which I gather is average for brunch. Everything we ordered was good. My wife ordered the peanut butter bacon burger based on a recommendation from the waitress. She loved it.   If you have the option, take a taxi or public transportation. I drove around for 30+ minutes looking for a space on the street. I gave up & paid $20 to park a block away.   They are known for their shakes, but none of us ordered one. We'll save that for our next visit. We'll be going back.~Jim-V-NYC~New York City, New York
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wish we could have gone every day for different meals! This place is so fun - creative decor, little touches that make you feel like you've returned to a favorite hometown diner. The food is so good! Worth every minute of the wait. Our first visit we ended up seated at the bar - comfy seats, not too close to other diners - hugely entertaining. A fun stop for a meal or a treat - and easier to get to than we thought! It's probably a good thing we don't live close by - we would be in every week at least! ;)~KLVBVH~Carmel, Indiana
Teds Bulletin 14th Street~4749634~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You can't skip a trip to Ted's Bulletin when you are visiting DC.  You will be both surprised and delighted at this modern day twist on comfort food. The fresh baked goods from their bakery are delicious! If you are at least a group of 4, you must start with the "Cinnamon Roll as big as ya head", as it is described on the menu.  It covers an entire plate and your server will pour the fresh frosting over it at the table. In the Jon's Omelet, you can taste how fresh the vegetables are.  If you like Eggs Benedict, try the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.  For the kid in all of us, I tried the home made Pop Tarts, which were offered in 4 different flavors.  Just to be current, one flavor was Salted Caramel.  All were yummy. I even tried a S'mores Milkshake!  The service was great!  The place was packed!  Be prepared to wait at least an hour as a walk-in.  They do not take reservations, however, you can call ahead to decrease your physical wait time.  Go there hungry and enjoy!~S D~New York City, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Brought hungry college students here.  Reminded me of The Hill in St. Louis.  Atmosphere was of a bygone era.  Polite. Dim light.  Delicious smells.  The food was unbelievable!  Huge portions would make for sharing.  Had lobster ravioli that was just scrumptious!  You will not leave hungry but you will leave satisfied and happy.  I will be back next time I am in Troy!~mjcrooksmomof3~southwest Michigan
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything on the menu is delicious and not overly priced!  The building is easy to find and parking is ample.~marjie3~Troy, New York

Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, like going to Grandma's house for a nice big meal.  Staff is super friendly and service is fast.  Decor could use updating.  Pasta fazioli is amazing! ~FionaPepper~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have only had carry out, Testo's is our preferred place for carry out pizza and wings.  Their pizza is the best I've found in Rensselaer county by far. They have a nice dining area and I'll make it for eat-in one of these days. All the times we've ordered we've been very pleased. Consistently good. Staff is friendly, down to earth and professional.~RoadWarrior47~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Husband and I went with friends who frequent here and are from Lansingburg. When we pulled up their were people waiting outside. Wait was about 40 minutes, not bad. Well worth the wait. No ambiance but we were there for the food. Husband had veal and peppers and he said it was the best he's had. I had eggplant parm which was also outstanding. Friends had the baked haddock which was also excellent. No doggy bags for any of us. We all finished every bite. We will definitely be back. Read a lot here about the pizza which we will have to try soon. ~Linda A~Clifton Park, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have seldom been disappointed with any of the food at Testo's. Close to home, hot and good. They are a family place and sometimes the order gets mixed up but we eat there a couple times a month~Jim S~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to Testos the other day and I was satisfied to say the least. Best Italian in the capital district. If you get the chance to go there, try the meat balls. You will not be disappointed . ~Acioffi20~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've be going to this restaurant for 40 yrs1  Their pizza is my all time favorite.  Always consistent, hot & fresh.  The dinners are excellent.  I have never been disappointed.  The staff is always friendly & helpful.  Love this little family place.    ~Karen J~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love the food.Eat their food all the time. Sauce is great. Meatball's are the best.

Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Testo's Has very good Sicilian Style pizza, this is sheet pizza for those of you who are not familiar with typical Sicilian fare I can only comment on there pizza which is not the best in the world BUT it beats anywhere in the general area that i have had! Excellent food per dollar ratios as well.~jhessup L~Troy, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Testo's has been my family's go-to spot since I was a child. Coming from an Italian family where my gram always made her own sauce and meatballs, it was hard to find a restaurant that was comparable. Testo's is the next best thing. The sauce is perfect and this is the ONLY place I will order meatballs. Everything on the menu is delicious, from the pizza to the dinners.  One of my favorite childhood memories is eating a bowl of spumoni ice cream after dinner! If you're looking for great home-cooked Italian food for a great price, this place is it!~Mocha927~Cohoes, NY
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The family has been going to Testo's for years and years. We ordered a pizza for an appetizer. Chicken parm and lasagna for entrees. Huge piece of lasagna that was to die for. The customer service is excellent. Such a nice night. ~DaynaLove~Albany, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a throw-back. In a good way! It's on a corner in a residential neighborhood in north Troy. You can tell by the look, and the easy way customers are strolling in that it is a place for local and long-time customers (though smart travelers know that's a sign of where THEY should eat, too). GREAT value for the money, food you'd expect in this style restaurant - pizza and all the pasta dishes. Chicken parm is great, so are the meatballs. Nice salads and dressing. Friendly service. dining room, decor, nothing fancy, but feels like home! Get a taste of Troy away from downtown. You'll want to return.~Mike R~Shelburne, Vermont
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is a little neighborhood restaurant with really good old world flavors! My husband, daughter and mother-in-law each had something different and they were all delicious. The sauces were fabulous and the portions were big. You may want to share. We will definitely be back the next time we are in New York!~Celina970~Basalt, Colorado
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We've never had a bad experience whether it be dining in or picking up. The consistency is wonderful! Their portions are HUGE and the price is well worth it!~12GreenApples~Averill Park, New York
Testo's Restaurant & Pizza~420263~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~YUM! I've never had a bad meal here. I eat here once a week at least. Friday's special penne alla vodka is amazing ! Also amazing is the meatball parm. Honestly everything on the menu is great. It's not a fancy place but it's very reasonably priced and the portions are huge. ~bayly79~Melrose, New York, United States
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't let the packed parking lot fill you.  The wait is small and there is plenty of room to wait worth free peanuts. Not a place for someone worth peanut allergies to go as they are all over and shells are all over the floors.  Great meal for family of 6 with 2 appetizers and entrees including NY Strip steaks and cocktails.  $131.  400 locations across the US and always a great meal. ~TheCleaningLady1972~Canastota, New York
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent experience, service and food! The kids loved it too! Very reasonable and a fun place. Would definitely go back. ~KingdaKa~Providence, Rhode Island
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can be tough on Eateries after spending several decades in the industry.  This experience was acceptable but not special. We had an sampler app.  I had the Fillet Medallions Salad and my brother had the Grilled Chicken Salad. I order the steak "rare" and it was served medium rare and just dumped on the rest of the salad.  The visual presentation was lacking on both salads.  How long does it take to lay it out to make it more visually appealing? The salads were large and filling and the flavor was acceptable.  Service was good.  We were greeted promptly at the door, even though they were busy. Our server, Ashley, was attentive.  We were thanked on our way out by several employees.  Acceptable Standard Corporate Restaurant Experience~RichsWanderings~Grand Rapids, Michigan
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've eaten here quite a few times, but always have to prepare myself for the noise level. It's a very hard room - all wood - and there's loud music, occasional line dancing by the servers, loud birthday party singing (the birthday person is perched on a saddle!) and yet, we return for the steaks. For a reasonable price (early bird even better and quieter) you get a very tasty, tender steak of your choosing. The sweet potato is large and delicious, and my sister loves the rolls, although I think they are like cotton - but they come with a cinnamon flavored butter. This most recent time the salad was rather old lettuce, but the servers are quick to fix or replace anything - we got a 2nd sweet potato, without them taking away the first which was overcooked, and both got eaten. The veggies, the usual mix of broccoli and carrots, were underdone and hard. But the steaks - we had the specially priced NY sirloin - were just delicious, and would usually pay the normal price with no problem.~DebbieinSyracuse~Syracuse, New York
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In Syracuse with friends we chose the Texas Roadhouse for its wide selection of entrees on the menu.  A Wednesday night and we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table, but the peanuts were plentiful both in the waiting area and again with a pail full when we were led to our table.  I guess we're getting old :) so that the birthday celebrant sitting on the saddle on the sawhorse birthday routine (rather loud but fairly brief...YEE HAH) which seemed to happen about every 5 to 10 minutes in close proximity to our table on top of the din of diners under a "hot tin roof" was a bit much, but still one of our group of four raved about her pulled pork dinner and I can say after a taste, it was pretty "smokin" good and my own selection of Country Fried Chicken with Gravy brought me warnings of premature capitulation to hardened arteries from my better half which simply made my enjoyment of the decadent offering that much better...that's what a vacation/holiday is all about!~Are J~Newcastle, Canada
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Late night dinner after my daughters softball game. Steak was "on point" as expected. Call ahead was convenient. We were seats within 5 minutes of our arrival. Service was good. Peanuts are the bomb!! Definitely will be back when in Syracuse. ~rox7372~Utica, New York
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The ribs were good but nothing like Dinosaurs!  It was a bit noisy but they were very friendly and reasonable.~Susie M~Nyc
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was an amazing experience.   We drove from Montreal to Syracuse through the adirondak mountains and after 500 or so miles we needed a great meal and good pinth of beer...    -Great food. Tasty and good quality !  -ENORMOUS portions -Lots of choice -Great choice of Beer   Service was quick and pleasant.   Highly recommand !!!~Kevin C~Montreal
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our second attempt at dining at the Roadhouse and we still had to wait a while to be seated. While we were giving our orders for our meals we had to virtually scream at the waitress in order to be heard. The service was just OK and the food was given in healthy portions, but the quality reminded me of more cafeteria style food. The bread with the cinnamon butter that was provided before the meal was really tasty and whetted our appetites for what we thought would be an incredible meal. We were a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's good. I just wouldn't wait the way it seems people are always doing to eat at the Texas Roadhouse.~Tim H~Syracuse, New York, United States
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived at 6:00 pm on a Friday night and were seated right away.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The food was good - okay the ribs were great!  The margaritas are as good as they boast.  Overall a good choice.~TravelingDeb4~Morris County, New Jersey
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We dined here last night all in all it was a good meal, but noting to rave about.  My only complaints were they were out of a lot of stuff at the bar it seemed and the server asks you to cut into your steak right away, I like to let mine sit for a few minutes. It does get a bit loud when the staff dances or there's a birthday.~Saracruise~Syracuse, New York
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a Texas Roadhouse open in Colonie, NY where we are from within the past 2 years and we gave it a try a couple times and weren't that impressed.  While staying in east Syracuse, we decided to give it another try and my wife and I were extremely happy.  The quality of the food and the time it arrives (hot) is important but the server can make or break your experience.  Let me tell you,  the drinks, the food, the attentions, everything was fantastic.  Our server, Nicole was exceptional!  I will double say that - "Exceptional"! Everything was just the way it should be.  The atmosphere, the attention, time to receive drinks and food and quality of food.  Nicole, keep doing what you're doing.  There's none better!  We'll give Texas Roadhouse another chance back home.  Maybe we can find another Nicole!~14alnjan~Albany, NY
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When we arrived the parking lot was packed.  We were worried about how long we would have to wait.  We were told 10 minutes and were seated in less than that.  We had the fried pickle appetizer, yum.  Our dinners were excellent.  We tried the 6ox sirloin steak and BBQ chicken.  Our waiter, Zachary was very attentive.  The early bird special, $8.99 per meal was a nice surprise (until 6 PM).  If I am back here I will definitely return.~Carl C~Franklin, New Hampshire
Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~great food,waiter was great ,fast service, many choices to choose from appetizers to meals! had steak,salads,blooming onion and a burger! great kids menu to!~Cathy M~Utica, New York, United States

Texas Roadhouse~879648~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~stopped in at 8pm on a Friday.  We were sat quickly, while we passed tables that were cleared and washed, we were sat at a table that still had glasses on it.  They were cleared quickly and we got a great waitress and we quickly forgot about the table we were sat at.  Food was good.~Judith A~Cortlandt Manor, New York, United States
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After walking the biggest mall in NY, we happened upon Texas de Brazil, we decided to eat here the next night.  With many empty tables, we still had a 1/2 hour wait which confused us, since nearly the same empty tables were still unoccupied upon our return.  Anyway, lets get to the food.  A great hot/cold salad bar, with excellent fresh mozzarella, awesome scalloped potatoes and many other luscious items.  Well most of us are not here for the salad bar its the meat.  They have so many cuts of meat, however my favorite was the leg of lamb, simply delicious.  There was a long cut of steak that was simply awesome.  People around us were simply raving about the food.  I cant say enough about the service, food and ambiance.  It is expensive, however you can eat so much it really negates the price.~David G~NY
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ate until we couldn't and it was hard to stop as you're supposed to celebrate by eating right? Awesome free dessert at the end to and service is incredible there!~familyman66slig~Baldwinsville, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food was excellent (especially the flank steak). The service was outstanding. My only complaint was that they tried to fit us at a table for eight when we were a party of nine, but they quickly added another table when I suggested it.~mem1964~Rome, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food, amazing. Service, stellar. Salad bar, extreme. If you leave hungry, shame on you. Staff very accommodating. Great experience.~Bob4782~Penn Yan, N.Y.
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hubby and I wished to take our son out while he was with us on leave recently. We had good experiences with the Brazilian Steakhouse concept (huge salad bar and wandering bands of waiters with many different meats carved to order) so we were happy to see the Destiny USA Mall had the Texas de Brazil. It's a decent size restaurant and we were there at seven pm, the most crowded time so we asked to get a table "outside" (outside the actual restaurant but still inside the mall).  What a mistake! At first it was just what we could have wished for... pleasantly quiet, just a few mall-crawlers passing by. At about eight pm, BAM! a joint upstairs started their "entertainment" for the night. At first it was difficult to tell what the noise was, only that it was LOUD. Eventually, it became clear that a pair of "singers" were belting out their selections, accompanied by a set of drums and a pair of guitars (as far as I can tell... we couldn't see them above our heads).  They may have been a decent band. Who could tell?! The three story atrium was the worst possible acoustic area. At our close distance we couldn't tell what they were singing. The musicians were drowning them out and the open area was distorting their voices.  After ten minutes or so, the waiter approached and asked if we would like to move inside. I thought it was very nice of them. Three waiters appeared and whisked our plates and drinks off to a quiet interior table. Ironically, the inside area had thinned out considerably and was peaceful, thank God!  The food was delicious and abundant, the atmosphere was quiet for the most part, the wait staff was very attentive, and we had a very good time.  Still... you've been warned. It is important to inquire ahead of time, when the upstairs joint is going to have live "music". It could really spoil a good time. Perhaps one should arrange to eat first and then head upstairs. I didn't think the music was good at all but it might have been the acoustics.~Trish F~Tyler, Texas
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I don't know why it has taken me this long to review this restaurant. We have been here several times and always bring someone new with us. The salad bar has a nice variety of items, not the usual fare which makes it nice. The establishment is clean and the waitstaff is friendly and accommodating. The variety of meats holds something for everyone, I myself prefer the filet mignon and the flank steak. If you are a bacon lover, get it wrapped in bacon, although I think that flavor overpowers the better meat, just my personal opinion. It is still good.  Even on a busy night, it is all good. Definitely worth the price and the trip.~Danielle K~Syracuse, New York, United States
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten here twice and it was absolutely amazing both times!  If you love meat, you will definitely love this place.  A little pricey but you get your money's worth.  The servers come over constantly and ask you if you want to try different kinds of meat....how can you say no??!!  There is also a very good size salad bar and the staff has been great both times we dined here.  We will definitely be going back soon!~pgrab31~Phoenix, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was treating my husband for his birthday and a couple of friends recommended this restaurant.  He is a true carnivore at heart so he really enjoyed himself. I opted for just the salad bar option because I don't share in his "passion" for meat. We were so pleased with our experience. The food was delicious and the service was great.  I had plenty to eat and there were so many options for me. He is still talking about how much he enjoyed the selection of steaks and chops, etc.  We have told so many people about this place.~nekol74~Binghamton, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you love meat you will enjoy this restaurant. The salad bar is also very good, you could make a meal out of the selections on it. there is plenty of salad, plus hot dishes and cheeses are available. The service was amazing, there were two servers assigned to our tables, water and drinks were promptly filled. The gauchos make the rounds of the restaurant with grilled meat on skewers. Beef, Pork, sausage, chicken and lamb. Some of the cuts were melt in your mouth excellent. although, I didn't care for the sausage.  Pace your self and lay off the carbs on the salad bar. The protein overload is very filling. I felt like I ate a basketball. Most of the meats were very tender. Some were a little too salty. We were seated, with a view of the kitchen and you can see them salt the skewers before bringing them out. I could see where that would put some people off. I asked and you can request them to not add salt, which we did. There is a lot of staff there, including some management types. We must have been asked twenty times, by everybody and their brother,  "how is everything"  Lighten up! I guess the only thing remaining is the cost. Such fine food and service does not come cheap. It was a special occasion for us (anniversary), so we splurged. The bill for two was over $100. Try it, but bring an appetite.~Mazuza2~Camillus, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our daughter-in-law always says, "Nothing says Celebration, like a nice slab of beef." Texas de Brazil might not serve big slabs of beef, but certainly many tender, pink slices accompanied by bacon wrapped chicken rolls and delicious lamb chops. The servers keep roaming with just perfect offerings of meat on long skewers. We paced ourselves, also nibbling on marinated vegetable salads and garlic mashed potatoes. We could not decide what we liked best, the sliced sirloin, bacon wrapped filet, prime rib, flank steak or perfectly medium-rare lamb chops.  Salad bar was very large and impressive, with probably 100 items - cheeses, olives, Spanish ham and salami, cilantro shrimp and several marinated vegetable trays - salad, too and several types of bread. Our dinner was expensive, but all details were perfect. Staff was extremely competent and friendly. Food was sooo delicious - as was the Sangria.~JudyandHoppy~Utica, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was delicious. It is very pricey for what you eat. $25-$35 for buffet but add meat it's $45 per person.~Julieann J~Queensbury, New York, United States
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was great and food was really great.The experience was great from start to finish. I will be back again.~smartphone88~Watertown, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There isn't much more that can be said about Texas de Brazil; it is an OUTSTANDING restaurant that does beef really, really well. They do come around with other meats, such as various pork dishes, Parmesan chicken, sausage, and more. But I always save the most room for the sirloin steak, flank steak, Filet Mignon, and Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon. OMG, it is to die for....and I'm not even a meat eater.    On the salad bar, they have superb marinated shrimp, olives, artichoke hearts, cheeses, and (BEST OF ALL), their thinly-sliced herb-infused (mint?) pineapple. Once again, it is ALL AMAZING.  If you don't want to spend all the money to get there, they often run specials.Last night, a bunch of us went there for the Veterans Day discounted meal, which knocked 50% off the price of our dinners.Try it....it's worth the effort to get there!~Larry W~Rochester, New York
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a meat, meat and more meat place that is a bit on the pricey end. The flow of meat never stops, beef, sausage, lamb, chicken etc. They have a buffet which is good but, you don't fill your plate on the potatoes, salad etc. It's a meat experience and vegetarians should not go, don't torture your lifestyle by watching meat being delivered non stop to a table every 5 minutes.   It's good don't get me wrong...but, it's meat.~Don L~Brampton, Canada
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We made a reservation (highly recommended) and were seated immediately upon arrival.  The server was very attentive and was quick to replace plates, refill water glasses and send over the meats we were interested in most.  There was some upselling efforts such as bottled water v. tap water, suggested wines for different tastes, etc., but we did not feel much pressure to buy.  My favorite meats were the bacon-wrapped filet and flank steak.  Everything comes standard as medium rare, but if you ask for more well-done meat, they will bring it to you, but you will have to wait longer between servings.~Robert S~Manlius
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Will recommend.  High price for the food, but it is way worth it.  We celebrated our 23rd wedding anniversary and the staff was very nice to us and even took extra care of us.  Food was amazing and the meats are really good and fresh.  Will recommend this restaurant.  Drinks were YUMMY~AnaMaria221~Cape Coral, Florida, United States
Texas de Brazil~4837646~Syracuse~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You will never leave here hungry. Everything here is great.  The salad bar is as well - I always have some, even though I know they take away space for the meats. Don't miss the lobster bisque, either. ;-)  I never have room for desert, but it sure looked good. Bring your appetite - this place is awesome.  ~jaltaman~Draper, UT
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here with a friend, sat near the kitchen side, oh which btw, this place is decided into two section the savory side and the dessert side, therefore, you get up and walk over to the other side of the restaurant when it comes to dessert time...   Anyhow, back to the place, modern, intimate and romantic I would describe the theme and decor. The food was very good. My friend and I had about 10 courses, excluding the dessert for later. We started light and progressively moved up. the journey was fun however it was not better then the last dish, which this was a disappointment, while the food was good. it just did not have that wow factor. nor the dish after was better then the last. However if I had to highlight three dishes it would be the Ham and Tomato with bread appetizer and the foie gras loli-pop and lastly some dashi noodles with a quail egg, i would come back for these dishes. While the dessert was great, Therefore, my overall experience was great! service was friendly and helpful!  id come back here again!~sam2066~Los Angeles, California
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I enjoyed dinner with several friends. The tapas approach allowed us to try numerous dishes, and all were superb. Service was excellent. The music was a bit loud for my taste.~sobaytravelguy~Santa Clara, CA
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Incredibly unusual, great tasting food. I have never before been asked to complete the meal in the dessert room ( a little gimmicky).  Service however is not up to par with a 5* restaurant.~Kenbob~Hoboken, NJ
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Mmm a let down.  We loved it's Miami restaurant so much that we dinned there twice in the same trip. When coming to LA, I booked this place 2,3 months in advance and specifically asked for a nice table.  However, we were seated in a table next to main hotel door. I feel I eat in a low ceiling hotel lobby bar instead of a nice restaurant. The area next to the open kitchen was way nicer and mor vibrate but we did not got a seat there unfortunately.  Then food. Very similar to its Miami sister restaurant, we saw the signature dishes. Good is that I think LA place is cheaper than Miami for the same dishes. However, nothing wow factor. Standard taste and standard service. Waiter does not see passionate about its menu. Compared to the Ivy and Spago, this is really soso experience. Even the guests here are less sophisticated than the other places we dinned in this trip.  We won't be back. ~prawnpipi~London, United Kingdom
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Bazaar housed in the SLS Hotel is a must everytime I visit LA. Whilst the traditional tapas are available I strongly recommend being adventurous and try the modern tapas. Amazing cocktails in the Bazaar will also not disappoint. Topped with amazing interiors and service you really feel like a celebrity.~mehmbers_only~Melbourne, Australia
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The ambiance of the restaurant is on point.  The food is amazing.  It's tapas style so you get to try a little bit of everything. Everything we tried was delicious.  The drinks are good and cool looking too.  They use a lot of liquid nitrogen which adds on to the "wow" factor.  I loved how you moved to another room to have desserts.  Make sure to leave space for dessert, you definitely don't want to miss that.  My only gripe was service.  Not on our waiters, who were amazing & knowledgeable.  It was just that there was a lot of "waiting" on things.  Although we had reservations, we waited close to another 30 minutes before we got seated.  We were advised to try and order all our food at the same time so that there could be an nice flow for out food.  There were times when 3 plates would come all at once than other times we were waiting awhile for any food plate to come. After we finished dinner, we waited in the dining room for another 20-25 minutes before our table in the dessert room was ready.  Also, when I made my reservations and confirmed that same day, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday which they seemed to have forgotten.  Oh well, it wasn't a big deal.  We still had a great experience.~TravelingCee~West Covina, CA
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food at The Bazaar is fun and imaginative and perfectly done. The service on the other hand was really a nightmare. The staff was disorganised and of the seemingly dozens of people who were "helping" us no one knew who was coming or going. At closing time I was finishing my drink and the server told me that he was going to call security if I didn't leave Immediately, this was at 5 til midnight. I've never been treated like this in any restaurant ever.~animeh~Doha
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The variety and quality was amazing. Great way to explore new flavours and share a meal with family and friends. ~mooseyman~Canberra, Australia
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a really super place. Incredibly inventive design and the whole layout is special. the service is fabulous and the food is really excellent but it is breathtakingly expensive. Is it worth it? Once certainly, twice no~QSMPEK~Almeria, Spain
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is something to try at least once in life. Just amazing! Be ready to spend around 90/120 dollar per person. But each dollar is worth it.~stefanorenna~Rome, Italy
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This one of our favorite restaurants in L.A. The staff is very friendly, and the tapas are mouthwatering!  I prefer the old fashioned tapas, and my wife likes the modern ones, but the one we always get extras of are the Jicama wrapped guacamole.  Wow!~Ken W~Las Vegas, Nevada
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a great time---the food was absolutely delicious, healthy, and the drinks were fantastic. It was very much a multi-sensory dining experience and super memorable. It will be hard to save room for desserts, but you have to as the dessert side of things is brilliant. Can't wait to go back. The servers were all great and were very cheerful---sometimes pushed too hard to convince us to get certain items on the menu, which was unnecessary and the only negative.~Nicholas B~Washington DC, District of Columbia
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a late table and in all honesty we were a little nervous about the menu as it sounds a little more complicated than it actually is.  The food was incredible, the cocktails magical and dessert was out of this world!   You simply have to try this place!! ~VictoriaWB~Langrick, United Kingdom
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stayed at the SLS for one night and decided to just go with the restaurant they had on site because it was the easiest option. We didn't realize the restaurant in the hotel was one of the top rated restaurants in LA, and we loved it. When you walk in you can see it is really big and has great style. We got a table on the patio since we found the inside too cold (air conditioning). We both ordered the tasting menu and it was so good. We were so full at the end though! We would go back for sure.~AS5000~Toronto, Canada
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Well worth every penny, extraordinary food, excellent service, truly a wonderful dining experiences. If your in the area you will be amazed at the creativity and flavors. ~TripTip101~NAPLES
The Bazaar by Jose Andres~922299~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we ate at Bazaar while staying at the SLS. The atmosphere is really neat especially the desert bar where you can walk around to diff rent stations and pick from all the different choices of chocolate etc. We shared various tapas offerings and all were excellent. The service was top notch as well and we relied completely on our server for all of our food choices. The price is on the higher side but inline with what you would expect in any similar restaurant ~kevin s~Waterloo, Canada
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fantastic, attentative staff and great food. Never disappointed. Recommend lobster roll, filet mignon, classic burger. ~HHajk~Stockholm, Sweden
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great W&W promotion for Duckhorn wine and a Wagyu burger for $25!   Basically you are getting a free burger which in itself is a great meal!   Service is first rate and the food is fabulous!   The promotion is an added bonus!! ~Fin-oh-way~London, United Kingdom
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just happened to pop in during a beautiful fall walk around the city. Bartenders are wonderful. Very, very amiable and attentive. Perusing the menu, and the aging beef in the window - we will undoubtedly return for a meal - in the near future.  This is definitely old school dining.  Your parents favorite steak place.  Love it!~james w~washington dc
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Meat carbonized outside, big failure for a restaurant of this level, and served almost cold, good choice of wine and good mashed potato as side. Desserts nothing particularly special. Would have expected something much better but, honestly, only few restaurants or steakhouses are serving well cooked meat here in DC. Scenery counts more than quality and this is what happens always more often. Pity~Sandro S~Rome, Italy
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My brother lives across the country from us, but met us in DC for the day.  We wanted to do something fun/nice with him.  This place was close to the tourist attractions and well rated, so we decided to splurge.  Glad we did as the food and service were great.  I had made a reservation, but when I called a couple of hours earlier we were able to get in.  We were in our short pants, but treated nice.  I ordered dessert and my husband and brother didn't.  I think the waiter may have brought us a bigger piece and 3 forks.~Morningfire~Port Orchard, Washington
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I and our friends ate here multiple times while visiting DC. The food was AMAZING!!!! Everything we had was exceptional.~Nick C~Houston, Texas
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our Uber driver recommended this Restaurant, though I knew of it prior to this. As with about 80-90% of the Restaurants in D.C., you need to make a reservation - go through Trip Advisor it is the fastest and easiest way. We were lucky we got an 8PM table.  We arrived a few minutes late, though I called and let them know we were running a little late - had to wait for the table to clear and be setup, so I went to the bar and ordered a drink and what a drink, no measuring ounce by ounce, this Scotch was to the rim and I was very impressed.  The ambiance is outstanding and the service out of this World. Tony Fagnani was our Server and he and hos Team definitely out did themselves. The Filet Mignon was superb. My Nephew, Grandchildren and I throughly enjoyed our meal here.  I have dined in some of the best Restaurants in the World and The Capital Grille just moved up to my top 5 or even top 2, just outstanding. This is Fine Dining at it's best!!!~PETER Z~Miami, Florida
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The waiter was probably one of the best servers I have ever had in my life - efficient, friendly, helpful, funny and fast.  This is a chain, so the food is the same throughout and very expensive.  Ridiculous prices for a baked potato that costs cents in a grocery store, but nonetheless, you know this going in.  Everything is a la cart.  We ordered steak and it was good.  I wanted something that was not on the menu anymore - steak with the crab and asparagus and our wonderful waiter delivered!~Samiya7~Hollywood, Florida
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is THE restaurant to go to if you are visiting the National Gallery of Art, which is more or less across the street. Go there, in fact, from any of the Smithsonian museums. Elegant and expensive, but if you want a special experience, this is a very good choice. I have taken my grandson, now age 12, to this restaurant every time I visit D.C. He regards this as our special "ritual" and rises to the occasion with superb manners and many expressions of thanks to me.~Verotchka~Irvine, California
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is not a restaurant I would go to frequently. But it was perfect to celebrate my friend's birthday and a short walk from my hotel. The restaurant tries for a clubby feel as though you would expect lobbyist to be angling for favors at nearby tables. But the service is impeccable and always helpful. Good wine list and the first presented to be on a tablet which made for easy comparison and search. Happy with the food (Crab and Lobster Cakes). Particularly enjoyed the butternut squash bisque even though I am not usually a fan of restaurant soups. Provided a bonus birthday desert at the end of the meal which is always a pleasant extra. Definitely a place to have a long, leisurely dinner in comfort.~cfreedma~Sydney, Australia
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was visiting the National Gallery and Nuseum and this restaurant is just next door , so popped in for lunch  Had the salmon and avocado salad which was great. Service was excellent too  Didn't manage to get a dinner reservation last week, so maybe next time~bcheong~Singapore, Singapore
The Capital Grille~1982299~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You will feel very comfortable inside. Perfect service. Food hmm... steks with bones vere perfect done as we wish. Great choice of vines. Expensive but worth the price~WaldekM1~Krakow, Poland
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived early for a 7.30 reservation on a busy Saturday. They were packed but we were seated at exactly 7.30. Table was nicely decorated for our anniversary. Service was outstanding, we didn't feel rushed even though we advised them of a time constraint, and our food came out right when we were ready for it at the perfect temperature. We had crab and lobster cake and clam chowder appetizers (both of which they split for us to share), filet and lobster tails, dry-aged NY strip, and a creme brulee dessert, and I can't think of a negative word to say about any of them. Sides are enough for two people but they will do a half-serving of most sides if you want to try more things. My only negative comment - they are using ipads for the wine list which in itself is great as it helps you choose exactly what you want but the brightness is turned up to the highest and you see then glaring all over the dining room as people choose their wine.~MarkNH~New Hampshire USA
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived on an extremely busy Sunday night around 7PM.  The bar was packed but since we were going to just get a couple of items, we decided to wait.  Our wait was brief & we were seated at a high top table by the window.  The bar was very noisy, full of patrons & the wait staff was extremely busy.  We ordered drinks & our appetizers.  Hot bread arrived - all was delicious.  We shared a bowl of clam chowder that was also extremely good, rich & filling.  The next item was supposed to have been lobster mac n cheese but there was little to no lobster.  We stopped here because we have The Capital Grille in our hometown & know how much lobster they add in the Midwest.  Since lobster is everywhere here in the Boston area, we would have expected at least as much.  Chowder was $12.  Mac n cheese was $18 1 very small portion of a glass of wine was $10  Iced tea was $3.75.  We were offered no refills on the tea.  Extremely high prices for the small portion of wine, no refills on tea & very little lobster in mac n cheese.  Evidently it is popular enough a location so that those items may not matter to all those who were present.  We enjoyed it too, but would not go back while we visit the Boston area.~DDDFJD~Carmel, Indiana, USA
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Classy location though it may get too noisy during peak times. Menu and wine list is outstanding. Needless to say the Steak is King and it is top notch. Service was at the level that you can expect from a place in this league. Pricey of course but it was worth it!~testaran~Rome, Italy
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every time we come to Boston we come here for dinner. The service, the food and the atmosphere its great.~Kiko C~Guaynabo, Puerto Rico
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything about this restaurant was great. The service in top class. Quality of food the best. Fancy is you would like to do well for youself. I could say the best steak ever.~Edda1~Reykjavik, Iceland
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great service and wine list.   We had a great meal and delicious steak but the au gratin potatoes were a little under cooked.    ~jdcombo~Marshfield, Massachusetts
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had dinner here in early October on a Saturday night. As expected it was very busy. For starters I had the butternut squash soup which was homemade and very good. For he main course I had the strip loin with sides of spinach & mashed potatoes. It was also very good, but not over the top good. The steak was slightly over cooked from my order of medium rare, but the sides were all top notch.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake with cherries. Again very good but not the wow factor I was looking for. Service was good, and the atmosphere was excellent as this is an elegant space.~Stirling B~Ottawa, Canada
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten at a number of steakhouses in Boston and CG has been consistently excellent.  The steaks are really good and the atmosphere is very good.  ~richard m~Boston, Massachusetts
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's the Capital Grille.... it was exactly what we expected. We arrived a little early and had to fight to get a drink at the bar, it was a Saturday night, but the bar staff seemed as if were more important to "impress" the regulars than just get us a couple of drinks. We sat in a quiet room, our dinner was "good" always want it to be amazing, but it's not. The service was great we had Brian as our server and he managed the room well and aside from a couple of minor things he was great!  We had a gift certificate that we wanted to use, I like the new location better, and like I said the dinner was good!~Len H~Taunton, Massachusetts
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Let me start by saying that I am not a particular fan of the Capital Grille franchise.  I've visited other locations and have been overwhelmed by the "mehness" of it all....overly rich, overly priced food that relies on a sense of luxury and indulgence to wow people into thinking they are enjoying a truly fine meal.  Well this Capital Grille actually delivers on the promise.   I came here for a business meeting.  We started with the soy glazed brussel sprouts...always a hit.  I enjoyed a bowl of butternut squash bisque whereas my colleague had the chowder  I'm not a steak eater but I was very impressed with the seared scallops...my companion had the filet and said it was done just right; it certainly looked appetizing.  Our server was attentive, pleasant, and informative, all without being condescending or intrusive.  This particular location restored my faith.  I likely won't seek out Capital Grilles in other locations but it is good to know that sometimes certain franchise locations can deliver a genuinely high quality dining experience.~Retinol13~Berkeley, California
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I stayed eat here for my 60th birthday whilst staying around the corner at the Sheraton. We'd booked this prior to our trip to the States for 2 reasons: (a) I love steak (who doesn't), and (b) the very positive reviews on tripadvisor. Well we weren't disappointed. I had a Lobster Bisque to start which was delicious (with large chunks of lobster in the bisque) and my wife's soup was also delicious. I followed this with the house special, which was a fillet steak served on the bone. It was perhaps the best steak I've ever eaten - it was mouthwatering. The service throughout the evening was very good.~David S~Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our group picked this for a dinner spot randomly because it was close to our function.  I had a very wonderful experience here.  The steak and lobster was delicious.  Steak was cooked perfectly to order and the menu was also cooked well.  But the brussel sprouts were so amazingly delicious.  It was crispy, sweet with a good dose of delicious bacon mixed in.  YUM!! All my dinner companions enjoyed their meals as well.~Gobeachmama~Texas
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Pros..Atmosphere is fine and quiet enough for discourse even though restaurant was crowded.  A couple of the appetizers were fine..about what one would expect at a decent B grade bar/restaurant.  Scalloped potato side very good for comfort type food. Service was very good except for the up selling. Cons..The food just wasn't good enough for the price.  My filet mignon tasted 'gamey'.  Reminded me of venison.  Cooking method of searing the outside meant that the outer half of the meat was very done on the outside while the inner half was medium rare.  Was there with 8 others..No one, except the person that picked the restaurant thought the food was worth the price which came to $100 a piece. Wine is particularly expensive for what you get and waiters are constantly trying to get you to pick a more expensive bottle.  Talked our friend up from a $60 bottle to an $80 one that in my opinion was worth about $20 retail.   All in all there are MUCH BETTER restaurants in the Boston area that will cost you 1/3 to 1/2 the price for bettter or the same food.~peerywolf~Lincoln, MA
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best NY Strip steak i have ever had in my whole life Great service, great wine, amazing steak and lovely asparagus with the stake. ~antriatou~Nicosia District, Cyprus
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This location only has hightop tables that are too small for four people.  We almost spilled soup several times.   Good food and good service is canceled by bad tables for business. ~Drew S~Austin, Texas
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place has the best calamari. Was very spicy and also crunchy but not to spicy. We did not have to wait to get sat. ~sholdertravels~New York City, New York
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We truly tested The Capital Grille over dinner with our group of 11 and they came through with flying colors.  The service was excellent, individual bills were presented without error and, most importantly, the food was excellent.  I started dinner with the clam chowder and it was one of the best I've ever had - wonderfully creamy with generous bits of potatoes and clams.  The small filet mignon was superb - perfectly cooked and a very tender cut of meat.  Definitely order some sides with the au gratin potatoes and sweet cream corn being the best.~John B~Toronto, Canada
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in the mood for steaks in downtown Boston. The Capital Grille came up #! on a TA search. I have eaten in their estrablishments in Washington, DC and New York. This did not disappoint. My fried calimari appetizer was done to perfection, followed by a New York strip steak no less so. My companions had the sliced filet and the steak tartare and were equally satisfied. Accompanied by a South Australian Shiraz it was a very memorable meal. In our opinions the #1 rating is well deserved.~Joel_Tzipi~Tel Aviv
The Capital Grille~322311~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~what an outstanding meal from the appetizers to dessert. the service is wonderful and many have been working there for a long period of time. the steak was cooked to perfection. if you have the extra funds well worth making reservations and eating here.~walkerbail~New Castle, Delaware
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As an Asian living away from home , this place is the best place to have some food that might have similar taste of Asian cuisine. Great desert, great vibe ! ~ShiraClinicandSpa~Hanoi
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cheese cake factory is one of the most trusted and solid restaurant you can find. Always good with so many different food and salad on the menu.  My favorite cheese cake is white chocolate raspberry. It's awsome. However this location is very busy and is not very convenient to eat here. ~amirk973~Los Angeles 
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. The location of this one is very good with Multistorey parking nearby, that can be validated by the cheesecake factory for 2 free hours.   The staff here were incredibly friendly, and the decor et cetera that you would expect from the cheesecake factory was first rate.   The food is always great and this was no exception as it was prepared extremely quickly, to a very high standard and at a reasonable price.  Highly recommended.~Chris E~Andover, United Kingdom
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Grabbed a late lunch here following a day of hiking in Griffith Park so needless to say we were absolutely starving. Ordered the shrimp sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. It was so filling and more-ish that I had to get my cheesecake to go.   We sat on the balcony, there was a nice atmosphere, and the service was great. ~Sarah A~High Wycombe, United Kingdom
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, awesome cheese cake, pricey and a little loud. Really busy on the weekends, but if you're in the mood for a lively environment and a large selection on cheese cake, this is the place for you. ~Alice S~La Grange, Illinois
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a pretty long wait but it was Saturday evening. Service was good and the food well it could have been hotter as it was left sitting while order was completed. Quality fair don't think I would bother going back.~cr159~St. Petersburg, Florida
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I like the restaurant's ambiance. The food was also good and the portion is big. staff are friendly. Waiting line is affordable. ~IbizaLoveYou~Kuwait
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went to have a lunch with my friend, it was first time, it was really good to enjoy "American Foods".  Very busy restaurant, but I want to visit again with my kids. ~Kee S~Santiago, Chile
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I`ve got surprise because my previous experience was only about the pie. The food is amazing but it is expensive...for special ocasions~Eduardo284~Sao Paulo, SP
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a must Every time we are in the USA . So much to choose from that you really get lost. Salad, sandwich or warm food all delicious. ~Rosanamannsp~Aguascalientes, Mexico
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant with a huge variety to choose from that would please the fussiest of eaters, & everything is reasonably price.  Have not had a bad feed yet!  My fav is the Carbonara & Mango & Strawberry frozen drink :)~JDB001~Melbourne, Australia
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The view in on the water and very nice although the sun will get in your eyes if you sit by the water at sunset.  Because they have outdoor seating, if you sit inside by the windows on the water, there is a constant stream of flies.  My girlfriend always gets the same thing - skinilicous salmon.  I change around and either order something from the skinilicious menu or just an appetizer.  I like the ahi poke that comes with won ton strips.  Most of the time I order the chicken.  I can't believe the huge portion you get for under 595 calories.  There are 2 huge chicken breasts with veggies and rice.  It is two meals for me!  We love this place.  The only problem is the parking.  There is a valet but it's another $4 and even then, there is no places for them to park your cars and it takes forever to get your car once you eat.~PLO528~Los Angeles, California
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant didn't live up to standards, and failed miserably last night.    #1) The service by Manual was slow/bad;   #2)  One of our entrees got taken by another server for another table, but, it took them 10 mins to see the problem (our table was missing one order) and another 10 mins to get another order made;  #3)  The manager voluntarily came by our table to acknowledge that the order was missing, but Angela didn't take the high road and she didn't take the opportunity to proactively adjust our bill....   Very disappointing experience....   I'm just glad we were at the restaurant having a good time visiting with family !!   I doubt I'll ever come back to this place when I come back to LA to visit with family here next time.~Greg H~Collierville, Tennessee
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took partner and 2 girls there for a Thursday night dinner, arrived around 6pm and was pleasantly surprised to fund there wasn't a queue. Shown quickly to a booth where out order was taken quickly, drinks and starter arrived and was as good as expected. Main course was also nice and had cheesecake boxed to take home. Would definitely return ~Liam K~Dumbarton, United Kingdom
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked in on the lower floor and provided our information to the host and were directed up the escalator.    Once we arrived on the second floor, we were greeted and escorted to our table.    After asking for our waiter's opinion, I opted for the Chicken and Biscuits.  I needed some "old fashioned, home cooked, comfort food."  I also ordered an adult beverage and a soda.  Our waiter was extremely busy but he did take time to discuss the menu and bring out drinks and subsequently our dinner.  To be honest, my chicken breasts were a flattened breast that had been cooked (sauteed?) with a little white gravy, vegetables and a mound of potatoes.  Their "Best Buttermilk Biscuits" were not.   One of them burned on the bottom and was almost as hard as a rock.     I was not overly impressed at all -- and while it is a family restaurant, when the parents seated next to you and their toddler is squishing food in all directions and banging silverware on the table -- there was no comfort.  After they left, the poor busy boy had to come and clean the carpet and squiggie the table.  This is NOT the fault of the restaurant and I realize that but it didn't help the overall experience.~glapril~Metairie
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What can I say about this place. Not only do they have amazing cheesecake but they have awesome and tasty food. On our first visit we came just for starters and mains. We both was very full and the service here is good. Can't remember what the name of our dishes was but I have attached pictures. Would come back here in a heartbeat :)~LSP9~London
The Cheesecake Factory~878494~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~the menu has so many choice offer that it is virtually impossible not to find that fit's your taste. And the...desert plenty of cheeze cake flavor to choose from. The service is very good from valet to table. Perfect for a meal in good company.~Michel M~Sainte-Adele, Canada
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A fabulous place to grab a substantive breakfast to start the day at the market - the groats are delicious, vegan-friendly, and really filling. We ate here, people-watched, and then wandered!~Hetali L~Chapel Hill, North Carolina
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A first time crumpet eater and enjoyed one with smoked salmon and veggies.  Close to the market and our hotel.  Get there early and there is no waiting.  Very filling and scrumptious!~rt113~Birmingham, Michigan
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After reading about this place we had to visit. It's only a small shop but definitely worth your time to stop in for a crumpet. We had breakfast here and we had expected it to be busy so we were surprised to find there were only two other tables taken in the shop and the occupiers of those other tables were also from the UK.~RoadsandRunways~Warrington, United Kingdom
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious crumpets.  Described as a cross between an English muffin and a pancake, the crumpet actually stands on its own - it's a crumpet!   Light with a bit of a crispness and a hint of sweetness they are enjoyable with savory toppings or sweet.   You will not be disappointed in either but I highly recommend one with maple butter.  Mmmm.  ~Joy G~Durham, North Carolina
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having never before had a crumpet, we were interested in exploring this food.  Shop is busy and makes the orders while you wait.  Prices seemed a bit high, but in line with the rest of Seattle.  Would go back when in town.~FenwickFarmer~Ionia County, Michigan
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'd read that it was reported in a reputable national magazine that The Crumpet Shop had the best scones (ironically) in America. It is a very busy shop and apparently has an extremely loyal clientele.  I eagerly stood in line for about thirty minutes expecting the fresh scone with homemade lemon curd to be - if not the best - well within my favorites range. Accurately billed  as "not dry," it tasted like too-sweet, very moist pound cake with nondescript lemon pudding instead of the tart lemon curd usually served in serious tea shops. To be fair, I was the only one in line who ordered the scone, and they all seemed absolutely delighted with their crumpets. Therefore, my advice is try  the crumpets but find your scones elsewhere. ~lrbp~Lake Charles, Louisiana
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Its not muffin, its not a biscuit, its not just bread. It is a little airy pillow of magic sorcery. Add cream cheese, lemon curd, or maple butter and church is OUT. This was hands down our favorite snack during our visit to Seattle. A sweet treat that you don't want to pass up (no matter how long the line is)~Charlie Y~Tampa, Florida
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend got the egg, ham and cheese crumpet and I got the Vermont "life changer" with cream cheese, maple butter and walnuts. We split them and had the best of both worlds. Absolutely must go here for breakfast or you are missing out on a Seattle icon.~valorrmac~Cincinnati, Ohio
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Newest delicious discovery in Seattle. One of many touristy shops in Pike's Place, but still a humble shop serving truly delicious and fresh crumpets unlike anything I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and get a 6-pack to go after stopping for a delicious crumpet - savory or sweet! Prices range ~$5 for a toasted sweet or savory, and $4 for a pack of 6 to go.~M_Norstein~San Diego, California
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place is really small and the line is always long but it moved pretty quickly. You can see they make it right there. Very good, simple and light. You won't be disappointed. Opens early and free refill of teas. Went back the next day. Wish I lived in downtown Seattle.~World Passport~Los Angeles, California
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our first time enjoying crumpets, and they did not disappoint.  I had a sweet one and my girlfriend enjoyed a breakfast one.  They were both delicious.~kingedward29~Michigan
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was a little disappointed with the crumpets.  Okay, but probably overpriced.  The tea that they allow you to refill for free all day was great though.  If you're in the market area for a long morning, stop here early and often~astaplet82~Dallas, Texas
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We called in here for a hot drink and a snack. We both had the Irish Breakfast tea and a crumpet each (one with jam, the other with marmalade). We enjoyed this very much.~GerMar60~Burton-on-Trent
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got here very early when it was still completely empty. We even got our own table. We ordered 4 crumpets to share (plain, Nutella, lemon curd, and one with pesto) and a couple of drinks. The crumpets were good but definitely not as amazing as we expected based on all the hype. Definitely wouldn't stand in line for more than 5 minutes for these crumpets.~Kellyn123~Rhode Island
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ordered two savory crumpets and a sweet crumpet to have along with our coffee. Not one thing was bad! Wish we had stayed in town longer than the weekend, we would have gone again. The free coffee/tea refills are also very nice~rrenfro1~Tulsa, Oklahoma
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You have to get there early as the line up for these tasty crumpets get's very long, but it's definitely worth the wait. With sweet or savory toppings they suit the whole family~caloundracouple~Brisbane, Australia
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yummy!! Traditional English crumpets served with a twist. As an English woman I still love them & ive been coming here for over 15 years !! & I'll be back ... Great coffee & teas too!!~Sarahws888~Buckingham, United Kingdom
The Crumpet Shop~555782~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~my girlfriend and i came here based on high reviews from trip advisor and its proximity to the market - never had crumpets before - they were delicious, although i have nothing to compare them against - a must to stop and try~bluegene126~ny
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Big and delicious blueberry pancakes. Some of the most yummy fluffy food in LA. A must go to when passing through the city.~Erick E~Los Angeles, California
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious, but lots of wasted food.  The pancakes are ginormous... and you get 3 of them.  Most people can't even finish one pancake.  Not only are they big, they taste great, too.  The velvet pancake is like eating wonderful cake with icing on it.  I'll be back again when in Los Angeles and when I am ready to gorge myself silly again .~Fishgeckos~Dallas, Texas
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great price and great service! One hint: Mom's French toast with a side of whipped cream and a side of strawberries... You will never look at French toast the same way again!!!~Mayaroundtheworld~Los Angeles, California
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had to place our name on a list and wait in line outside.....on a Monday.  This place is POPULAR!  Had the Yellow Brick Road pancakes.....which overflow the sides of the plate.....caramel and nuts.....so good.  Also had eggs benedict which is served over a bed of potato skins.....nice!  Coffee is french press.  Large menu that includes burgers and salads too.  Good service.~stoketun~Los Angeles, California
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I walked about a mile from my hotel on the recommendation of staff for breakfast - and I am so happy I did. As you may guess from the name, this place serves mombo pancakes. I opted for the deli breakfast (bagel and lox with eggs) and it was great! Service (while it was very busy and slow) was excellent. The coffee in French press was amazing. Go - relax, enjoy the wait, look at all the folks and then have a helluva breakfast!!~Matthew R~Hartland, Connecticut 06027
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I'm glad there's not one of these in England because I'd be the fattest girl ever.  If you enjoy sweet treats, get Moms French Toast.  My husband said I made a weird noise of happiness when I had my first bite. Seriously, it's out of this world.  Portions are huge. I asked for the smallest meal & French toast (see pic) there was nothing small about it.  You can takeaway what you don't finish.~tanewman~England
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So this is the kind of place happiness is made of :) be prepared for a long queue but the wait is worth it, also parking is a pain here......get your kids here to have the world's best pancakes (i guarantee no adult can finish their gigantic pancakes), the eggs benedict are amazing and are served on potato skins instead of the English muffin which is surprisingly tasty.....the Italian veg sandwich and the omelettes are also amazing, oh also the coffee here .....too good........overall this is your typical American breakfast place which will make you so happy u will miss it forever......i wish they open a branch in India!!!~GurpreetMehdiratta~New Delhi, India
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very big portions, you can share for sure. The cafe works all day long, they offer american cuisine. We ate hamburgers  and tacos, couldn`t eat all the fries which came along. We arrived at 2:30p.m. so we didn`t have to wait, but according to internet info, it`s recomended you reserve before arrive there. Cosy place.~Viviane_Muller~Porto Alegre, RS
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We determined that we had to visit The Griddle Cafe during our visit to Los Angeles based on the reviews we had read. The cafe is located in very close proximity to other Hollywood sights so it fit in perfectly with our itinerary for the day. There was plenty of parking behind the cafe, and there was no cost, which is great (esp. for Los Angeles). Upon our arrival we were treated by a server who was very customer friendly and successful serving all 5 tables in the restaurant. We sat and were struck immediately by the incredible portions on the other patrons plates. Based on the menu we decided to share two separate plates. We ordered Mom's French Toast and the "Poached y Papas" Benedict. Both were incredibly delicious and came out quickly. We enjoyed sharing both and since we had mentioned this to our server we were provided two smaller plates.   You will remember this cafe for the rest of your visit to Los Angeles!~swood73~Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had been told about the good, quality breakfasts here so made a visit on out trip to LA. Yes, nice food and good service but certainly not worth the 20+ minute wait when you can get pretty much the same stuff up the road at Mel's. Still, if you have time on your hands, worth a visit.~PeterThomas1980~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We popped in here for breakfast of pancakes and boy they were nice  we was in fact going to another place but walked past here and thought why not.  A very nice place but the food was 10/10 for us,  I'm sure later in the day this place gets really busy and the staff were excellent as well and very polite~Mark F~New York City, New York
The Griddle Cafe~350455~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were on our way to another location and this place popped up as an excellent place to have breakfast so we thought, why not? We were not disappointed! It is a very small place. Parking can be very challenging however a local told us there is free parking behind the Rite Aid which is practically next door. The griddle seemed to be completely packed, yet they seated us in a huge booth in the back. They will not seat you unless your entire party is there. My husband was outside on a conference call because it is extreme noisy in there, and I felt like we may not be allowed to stay if he didn't hurry up (points deducted). The food is very good. The pancakes are enough to feed the entire table, no kidding. They have delicious French press coffee and morning cocktails. I would give this 5 stars except that I felt under pressure for my entire party to be seated (he was right outside and they had to check) and our server 1) didn't offer another mimosa and 2) didn't bring our final check. I'm sure he went on break, but it would be nice to be told that. I felt that they all were a little rude. A group of ladies behind us were told to wait outside-and it was chilly and rainy. I think the manager or owner was pretty gruff but, if you can see past that, the food is excellent! Might be hard to get into and they seem very hurried! Expect to wait! ~Ralxndr~Reno
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Arrived as a surprise booking for lunch with friends! Felt really undressed for the venue, however we need not have worried, the staff were lovely and took great care of us. food was amazing and plenty of it. enjoyed waving to the tour buses and felt like a celebrity for a couple of hours, the best Wednesday lunch ever! Everyone should eat there at least once.~Vegas-Queen666~Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~At the request of one of our friends, this was a "must go to" while we were in California. I was pleasantly surprised. I had heard of The Ivy but never really had a desire to go. I found it to be a cozy little place and we of course had to dine out on the patio as per our friend's request. The food was very good as was the service. It's a crowded restaurant but the experience was a good one. I would go back again.~Chris236D~Brooklyn, New York
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Charming, famous restaurant in the heart of Beverly Hills. The decor is lovely. Floral decor and fresh multicolored roses on every table. The service is excellent. The food isn't great, but it's fine.  The Eggs Benedict was very good. The French Toast was fair. All in all it was a very pleasant time with family in a lovely atmosphere.~Phyllis M~Las Vegas, Nevada
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had a beautiful lunch on a sunny day in LA. Very pretty resturant with delicious food and very friendly staff~embenfleet~Benfleet, United Kingdom
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I haven't been here in a few years, but we got to stop in last Friday for lunch!  We made reservations that morning (recommended) and we were greeted warmly and offered our complimentary champagne.  Once seated we took our time and ordered things to share, so that we were able to try several things.  We had oysters, lobster ravioli, 3 types of sorbet, and stone crab claws.  All were on point.  the drinks were refreshing -- Ivy gimlet and the raspberry gimlet to be exact.  Service was first class as usual.  This place isn't inexpensive, but the location, atmosphere, food quality, and service justify it!~PlanoGreg~Plano, Texas
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I recommend a visit to the Ivy on Robertson as it's a great place to hang out, but only if you are on the patio.  The tables are place very, very close together and the music is very loud (for some reason is getting louder every time I go there!) so don't expect to be able to have a conversation!  It's more of a place to people watch.  The food is okay but you aren't really going for the food let's be honest!  It's a very pretty place and very French feeling.  I wouldn't recommend this for kids or for people in wheelchairs, although they do have a wheelchair lift.~310Amanda~Los Angeles, California
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lives up to the hype, had lunch at the Ivy and the food was very good my kids loved the Pizza and my husband had the ribs which he enjoyed loved the look of the Ivy with the garden setting and all the fresh roses.  Would definitely recommend ~lovetotravel01061972~Sydney, Australia
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I visited Los Angeles in October 2016. We are from Sydney Australia and travel regularly to Europe and the USA.  The Ivy is the best restaurant for breakfast we have found anywhere we have visited. It is faultless. The breakfast menu is limited but what is on offer is superb in every way. The attention to cleanliness and detail is awe inspiring. The service is 10/10. The fresh flowers and linen table clothes add to the atmosphere.  Parking is not a problem and sitting outside on a warm morning is so relaxing. But be prepared for an expensive outing, for all this quality is not cheap. However, if you want a truly memorable breakfast, spend the money. You will never forget this breakfast.~roamingwulff2016~Sydney, Australia
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Never been her for dinner - but the lunch her is great. Super service, great food and great atmosphere.~sivrei~Oslo
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Restaurant is very pretty and great place to meet friends.  Love the champagne on arrival .  Food is mediocre but mostly about the experience . They had a very good zucchini blossoms special night I was there !~travelnut2009~new york, ny
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in for an impromptu dinner. Offered champagne , indoor or out door table. Reliable good service and food and near our hotel. Another LA favorite, pretty, delicious and consistent. ~NC R~NYC
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere was Beverley Hills chic with a complementary glass of bubbly  on arrival, dozens of waiters hovering around in an attempt to make you feel special and a decadence of gorgeous vases full of roses. The terrace was lovely and gives you a chance to people watch. The service was efficient and professional. The food was OK but certainly not the best thing about the Ivy. I thought it was expensive but worth the experience as in my case it was a one off~margaritaparrish~Sydney, Australia
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant truly lives up to its reputation! The food as great and so are the drinks! And the whole atmosphere of the place is just amazing, I highly recommend this place! It is absolutely a must see when you visit LA. ~vibgre~Oslo, Norway
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a fantastic little brunch here on a sunny Saturday morning, starting with champagne on the house. What a great way to set a mood! Outdoor seating on the patio with pretty pillows, flowers everywhere and shaded by umbrellas was perfect. My husband loved his crab Benedict, and my pancakes and bacon were exactly how I like them. We also loved the free chocolate chip cookies at the end. My husband is already talking about going back there. ~IrishColleen2010~Chicago, Illinois
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a great night here and where entertained by a charming waiter who seemed to recommend everything on the menu. I ordered the large lobster dish . It was a lot of food , but seemed to be smothered with sauces and salads and you did not really get the lobster taste. I could not eat it all , so really it was for two people .  Anyhow the food was good but not excellent . The restaurant is beautiful., one of the prettiest restaurants I have every seen. The staff are friendly and entertaining and the experience was enjoyable.~RickX01~Brisbane, Australia
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We sat outside and were overwhelmed by the vibrant atmosphere, all the tables had fresh flowers vases, the heating poles provided ideal and confortable temperatures, the service was outstanding, the food was fantastic, we really had an excellent evening, I am certainly going back!!~ChristianePedreiro~Uberlandia, MG
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While on a trip to the LA area, my husband had to make sure we ate at the Ivy.  The food and service were amazing!  I had a seafood platter that I could not finish.  It was huge!  My husband had  half rack of lamb and asparagus that he said was the best he's ever had.  Great atmosphere!  Loved the Ivy!~pryncess830~Spartanburg, South Carolina
The Ivy~348150~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this place is iconic and is a fun place to eat with a  good atmosphere andtremendous service. the flip side is the food is average at best and it's very expensive.~Randy G~Los Angeles, California
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Appetizer was tuna crudos.  The tune was ultra-fresh and a wonderful taste composition.  I have not had such great tuna since visiting Maui.  Mains were lasagna and spaghetti noir.  Both were excellent, especially the lasagna.  The waiter provided a perfect wine recommendtion.  The service was very good.~FuzzyBeaver~Montreal, Canada
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Entrance to the restaurant is located in a back alley. Good set up. We were well received and seated immediately. I had an appointment but I am sure you can get by without one on weekdays. We had the wild boar stew and fennel crusted roasted duck thighs. Wine selection was good as well. Service could have been better but nothing to complain about. We went on the Halloween night and we got to see some performances in between. Food is fairly priced in my opinion and we thoroughly enjoyed dining here.~abhirv87~Bellevue, Washington
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Finding the place is a challenge.  Upstairs from the front street, downstairs off of the back alley. If in doubt......look for the PINK DOOR.  The menu is minimally presented with a few dailies. All that came out to our party of 8 was well prepared and presented as it should be, but nothing special. No complaints, but no wows. The service is attentive and professional. The wine list is comprehensive with many fairly priced selections for every budget. There is a full bar with music in the front lounge area. I was expecting more considering previous reviews from other TA reviewers. Again, no complaints, just underwhelmed. ~TravelAgentDave~The O.C., California
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great ambiance, great food, great service!  Good for special occasions.  Will be back in the Summer to enjoy the outdoor deck overlooking Elliott Bay. Reservations suggested.~CisVancouver_WA~Vancouver, WA
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food, fantastic service, didn't love the "show!"  Wouldn't come back, wish I would have been outside on the deck - I would come back if I could sit out there looking at the water!~Marcy W~Kirkland, Washington
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I found this restaurant on the internet before our trip, listed as a sort of hole in the wall that was a rare gem!  And wow, was the description right on! Food and service was just splendid!  Nightly entertainment, provided just the right amount of background music that did not interfere in your conversation. Just a completely relaxed and beautifully appointed restaurant to sit back and enjoy good food and your companions!~marphilk~Syosset, New York
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I would have never found this place without a recommendation from a local.  No sign, just a pink metal door and a wonderful, delicious experience!  They also have wonderful gluten-free options.~Jamie Kay S~Saint Louis, Missouri
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I were visiting Seattle on our month long drive through of Washington Oregon and vancouver island, and after a long day of walking and laughing we decided to check out tripadvisors recommendation for restaurants. Topping the list was the Pink Door.  And for good reason. We decide to take a chance and hustle over. We "found" the door while walking down the alley (as they have no sign), and stumbled down the stairs to be greeted by two hosts.  We had no reservation and the place was hoppin'!  They found us a table on the bar side and we gladly accepted.  Passing the swing hanging from the ceiling, and taking in the general vibe of the place we were expecting to be entertained as well as served.  And we were!  The music that started during our meal was fantastic, the service was attentive, informative and cordial, and the meals were excellent.  The price point was very reasonable.  In general though we were very pleased to,learn that the top suggestion on tripadvisor was not the high end, generally overpriced, restaurant, but rather a very unique place with a well thought out menu and concept, that is delivered in a way that makes everyone feel welcome and while delivering top notch food, drink and ambience.   We wholeheartedly recommend Pink Door....you will not be disappointed!~calgarypat~calgary
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Pink Door was outstanding! I saw the good reviews and couldn't wait to try it! The atmosphere is so cool! It added to the experience! Food was soooo good! We had petrole sol (excellent!), cioppino (compares to SF!) and gluten free pasta (excellent!)! I would highly recommend!~DennyDen4~San Carlos, California
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was excellent and the drinks were great as well. We had tuna carpaccio and octopus for lunch that were both very good. We sat on the patio and the weather was lovely and the service was great as well. This place is a bit tricky to find- there's a lack of signage and the door is not exactly pink- well worth it to find though.~raferjack~Corpus Christi, Texas
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tricky to find, but very worth it!! My sister and I were lucky to have the perfect weather to sit outside with absolutely wonderful view of the Sound.   I don't think you can go wrong with any item on this menu. The fish of the day was one of the best, I ever tried.  Excellent service from the time you walk in to be seated, til you leave.  I highly recommend reservations. ~lisacan2~Fort Wayne, Indiana
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here for a dinner during a recent vacation to Seattle. The Pink Door was highly recommended by our friends who live here. It was Restaurant Week, so we got the set menu with wine pairings for two for a ridiculously good price. We didn't have a reservation, so we arrived early and we were able to be seated. The place was not full around 5:30, but that changed while we ate. The food was inspired and the wine pairings went perfectly with the meals. The choices seemed to be pulled from the main menu, which was nice since you might expect to have the same dish on a return visit. Service was good but a little slow as mentioned by some other reviewers, but it was not a big deal. They filled the water frequently enough. We were done before the trapeze artist performed, but we hung out on the rear stairs with several other people to watch the show.~John M~Milwaukee
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We cannot say enough good things about The Pink Door. This cozy spot has some of the friendliest staff and best food in Seattle. The grilled octopus was perfectly cooked. We also ordered the lasagna-which is some of the best I've ever had. We also tried the the linguine with baby clams in a white wine sauce. It was so good-and there were so many clams-what a delight! As for beverages, we ordered a Dump Trump (whisky sour with a red wine float) and it was so tasty! We also ordered a carafe of house red, which paired nicely with our entrees. From the staff to the food to the ambiance, the Pink Door was an amazing experience. We will definitely be back. ~PostcardPassenger~Seattle, Washington
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner here our first night in Seattle, we had booked a table in advance after reading how popular it was. The trapeze act was on while we were there and she was brilliant.  The food here is excellent but the atmosphere here really elevates the experience. This was one of the best meals we had on our trip and we will definitely be back when we're next in Seattle.~RoadsandRunways~Warrington, United Kingdom
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were visiting from out of town. Reservations were booked, but were able to get seated in the bar area in a reasonable amount of time.  There was live music playing.  Service was friendly and great.  Food was fantastic.  We had to go back at the end of our vacation to get more of the great atmosphere and fish dinners (they change at least weekly).  Had tuna crudos-so fresh and wonderful.  Kale salad was fantastic.  Would recommend highly.~margaretf821~rhode island
The Pink Door~463486~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow. You might think it's a tourist trap because of the trapeze shows, but the food is fantastic as well. The bread was marvelous, as was the caprese salad. The cocktails were cleverly named, but delicious. I had the famous lasagna, and it deserves its fame. I am going to try and recreate it at home, wish me luck! My husband had the tuna, and it was perfectly seared with a delicious sauce. We enjoyed dessert as well. I had an apple cake and my husband had a very delicious berry dish. We were there on a Monday, so we were able to see the trapeze/aerial performer. She was amazing. I was mesmerized...we were able to enjoy three performances, because we hung around at the exit just to see her again. Each performance was different, costume change as well as how she used the equipment. They frown on you taking photos, but how could you resist? We called for a reservation, but were told that none were available, but we could stop by as they leave tables open for walk-ins. So were were there early (6;15) and lucked out. Our server was attentive, helpful and friendly.~travellerfromatown~Allentown, Pennsylvania
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Downtown Troy is architecturally gorgeous and loaded with fun bars and restaurants. Fall is the perfect time to walk around and then stop in one of them for a pint or two.  But it's hard to imagine anybody having more craft beers on tap at once than The Ruck. And they have the small 5 oz choice for easy sampling if you don't want to commit to the larger sizes. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a nice mix of twenty-somethings, college-age and middle-age. Didn't have any food but had a pretty good time at the bar chatting up the bartenders and watching baseball.~mhfella~Upstate New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great bar, mostly college age kids. Big list of beers but the main thing I see, the wings. Simply the best around!~JVRyan~Troy, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I recently moved back to the Albany area and I decided to try out The Ruck. Place wasn't too crowded on a Tuesday night. All craft beers and they are cheap compared to most bars, with most pints being around $5. I went to undergrad in Buffalo and I can say that the wings here are the best I've had outside of the Buffalo area. They've just earned a regular customer.~cl1994~Albany, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was under the impression before going The Ruck was more of a pub.  It's really a bar with a few tables.  Sat for a while before anyone acknowledged us.  However, food was good.  Burger was one of the best I've had.  Fries were a touch soggy/limp for me.  Overall may go again for food, but ambiance is not my scene.  Street parking only.~M C~Troy, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are into beer and good food, this is your place.  They have several staffers that have been trained and received certification in beer tasting and serving - Cicerone certified.  They take the beer very seriously.  Then they hired a CIA (Culinary Institute of America) graduate to run the kitchen.  Now that's how to run a bar, get employees who are passionate about what they do, then motivate them to excel.~Tom F~Albany, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you're in the Albany, NY area, you must take the time to go to the Ruck to have their Wings. They have the best wings around with home made blue cheese dressing, great selection of  beer on tap and all of their other food is good too. You can shoot darts and i believe there are a couple of pool tables and possibly another game.  Great place to go with a group of friends or dine alone, because the odds of meeting someone really cool are pretty good. People are always friendly in this atmosphere, so sit at the bar, have a beer and make some new friends!~donnac93940~South Lake Tahoe
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lots of beer, staff knows what each tastes like, the style, etc.  Consistently good food across several trips, especially the wings.  Empanadas were very good this last visit.  Gets busy, be prepared to wait for food!~Ann-Non-E-Mouse~Morehead City, North Carolina
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My companion and I went to the Ruck because we knew that they had a great selection of beers, and we had heard that they had "prize winning" wings. On the first count there is no arguement.  As far as the wings...they were good, and I would happily have them again, but I didn't think that they were all that much better than wings I have had in many other places. The bleu cheese was sub-par as were the onion rings that I had. Companion said that fries were OK, but nothing to rave about.  Ambience was loud, hip anti-elegant, and funky-fun. Service was about what I would expect, not top end restaurant, but good enough.  If I am in Troy and want wings I will go there again, but more because of the beer.~PainterRob~Delmar, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My favorite bar in Troy - for beer and for bar food. If its what you're craving, its worth checking out. I haven't had better wings anywhere in the Capital District. It can get crowded so, if thats not your scene then...take that into consideration. ~Don T~Clifton Park, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I visited The Ruck during RPI parent orientation.  We were hot, thirsty, and sad about leaving our youngster behind.  The bartender (I sadly cannot recall his name, only that it isn't Joe) quickly assessed which alcoholic beverages and food would transiently improve our mental health and made appropriate suggestions.  I had an Al Bundy and my hubby had craft beer on tap, and we had the quesadillas, which were very fresh and tasty -- restaurant quality- not at all like typical bar food-- and delivered promptly.  The Ruck attracts an educated and jovial crowd.  You should go.~Patricia H~Chapel Hill, North Carolina
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My young adult son and I met an old friend from my high school days here for lunch today.  We enjoyed the beer (danged if I can remember what all we drank, but it was delicious and the perfect temperature) and split two orders of wings (medium and Thai chile) and an order of mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce.  I've had better fried cheese, but the wings were transcendent.  We were too sated to order anything else, but there's always next time. This pub is a great choice for a  casual chow-down and adult beverages.  It would be perfect if finding parking in downtown Troy weren't such an exercise in frustration!~Lori12309~Niskayuna, New York
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~OK, from the looks, a rough gem, though walk right in because it is definitely a gem!  From an excellent menu & kitchen, to an amazingly friendly wait staff & bartenders, and a very cool beer & cider & whiskey selection, you will want to make yourself comfortable & just hang out awhile.  This is a really cool pub that almost looks like a dive bar though you quickly realize it is so much more. My wife and I visited (1st time) on a Sunday evening with only 45 minutes before seeing Craig Ferguson at Troy Savings Bank Music Hall (2 blocks away). We wished we could have stayed longer. The woman who waited our table kept our orders moving so we could make the show, and she worked with the kitchen to place the order with grace & efficiency (thank you!), which made us feel relaxed and not rushed.  And, even the bartender went out of his way to say thanks and goodbye when we left ... nice touch guys.   With a couple of great pints, we also had very different food orders and both were excellent ... we want to return to try many other cool items on the menu, not to mention the great selection & variety of craft beer & ciders, served by real pros.  They even had an impressive variety of veg/vegan menu selections. Can you tell we liked the place?.   Find a reason to go here for the amazing kitchen, friendliness, and variety & selection  of beer (they're obviously tuned into the craft brew and hard cider scene, very cool).  The music energy is very cool, too.  And, be hungry when you come, because the menu is such a pleasant surprise.  Why go to that overcrowded semi-famous barbecue place when you can get bigger, better, more creative, more cool choices of really cool food & drink here?  It's so much more than just pub food, more than just comfort food, with a really creative menu with sizable dishes & very reasonable prices.  Yeah, we'll definitely be back.~Paul B~Altamont, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Older bar, dark with lots of wood. Excellent service, and the pub fare is very good, excellent stuff.~feralman~usa
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Ruck reminded me of a hundred places I used to go in college, but nicer. The casual atmosphere is welcoming and the comfort food is good. They have an excellent beer selection and the bartenders are knowledgeable about their stock. If you're looking for a trendy place, this is not the right choice. But, if you're looking for a solid, down-to-earth place to enjoy some time with friends, give The Ruck a whirl!~eluper~Albany, NY
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was my first visit to The Ruck which was mentioned as one of the local bars participating in the Great Migration promotion for Goose Island brewery. The small plate menu was enticing but we were there for the Breakfast for Dinner beer pairings. My friend ordered the salmon omelette while I had the hanger steak with poached egg and hash browns. The food came out fast, portions were satisfying and delicious. The server was friendly and knowledgable and the beer pairings made the whole experience more quirky and fun. I plan on returning to explore some more.~Linda G~selkirk, United States
The Ruck~3735989~Troy~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried out the upscale restaurant literally up the stairs at the Ruck. The food was inventive and delicious,  the beer list great, the waiter knowledgeable. .but there was something in the air that made our eyes burn, and it was so noisy...even with just our group of six..that we couldn't hear when a group filled the rest of the 30 or so seats, it was unbearable!  Hence my 3 star review.  Acoustics and air filtration , people!~kelly48571~Schaghticoke, New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~As a Registered Dietitian in the Mohawk Valley I was happy to see so many people embrace the farm to table healthy eating experience! The food was exceptional and the staff was a pleasure! A true epicurean delight!~mnaples888~Utica, New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Can't say enough about the attentive staff.  Our daughters visiting us from NYC were very impressed with the food.  One raved about the aged filet mignon and the other enjoyed the vegan risotto.  We chose a reasonable priced red wine that we all enjoyed. The only disappointment was an appetizer (the summer vegetables, roasted & raw). The serving size was very small and not very flavorful.  The other appetizer pan seared scallops were delicious.  My husband and I had the steelhead sea trout which tasted like salmon and was good.  For dessert we shared a mango sorbet that was delicious.~Jo Anne V~New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Farm to table restaurant. Freshness of the food is palatable Small seasonable menu with plenty of options big and small. The bartenders are very helpful in making menu choices, and great wine selection. ~lmoore002~Ontario, Oregon
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First visit in 6 months and I was not disappointed. Great food, fresh ingredients, pleasant service. Worth the trip.~nycfamilyt2013~NYC
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I returned here for a really nice night out, and we were not disappointed.   Our online reservations were followed up with a pleasant phone confirmation. We were greeted warmly at the door. Our waiter explained everything carefully and thoroughly, and the food was superb.   It's always such a dignified and satisfying experience at this establishment. ~Rick S~Whitesboro, New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The service was exceptionally good, the atmosphere warm and inviting. We had heard good things about the restaurant and invited another couple who also had not been. The food in general was disappointing.  The pan seared scallop appetizer appeared undercooked.  We tried the rabbit appetizer, and it was okay...really nothing to compare it with.  The main entrees were not flavorful.  The chicken adobo was cooked well, but was all dark meat, not really tender, and would not order again.  The Hoppin John dish had very little seafood and really had little flavor.  I did not finish eating the dish. We will give it another try.  Mmaybe the chef was having an off Friday night, but we will not recommend to others until we try again and are satisfied.~Fran D~Lowville, New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had the most amazing dinner. The staff was very knowledgable and on point. The food was so fresh I had the filet mignon and my husband had the pumpkin gnocchi. The meat was soo tender ! The desserts sounded amazing but we had no room. Went on a Friday night no reservation we were seated within 25 minutes the place was packed awesome night and dinner ~kmrs~White Plains,New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We recently overnighted in Utica, and came across The Tailor and The Cook online. It's a lovely spot, and if we lived in Utica it would be a regular go-to spot. The food was delightful. We had the grilled lamb sausage (very tasty) and pan-seared scallops to start, followed by the house salad and great homemade breads. Entrees did not disappoint: Pan-roasted veal chop and the fried half chicken. Service and ambiance were perfect and the restaurant has perfect acoustics. It's both loud and easy to carry on a conversation. Close tables pose no problem. Highly recommended.~Greg P~Bakersfield, vermont
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped at this restaurant while passing through Utica on the way back from the Adirondacks.  The staff was very friendly and eager to please.  As a matter of fact, water glasses never got or remained empty for more than a moment.  I have never seen such attentiveness to water.  Bravo!  The quality of the food was excellent and the presentation very nice.  My only gripes were twofold:  the first, the size of the portions in relation to the prices.  I ordered a veal chop and got a veal chop, Jr..  While unquestionably delicious, it was the smallest veal chop I have ever had or seen.  I can't fault them if that is the size of the chops that were available from their source.  OK, but then don't charge $36 for it, or put 2 on the plate.  My second gripe was that the complexity of the dishes was overreaching and in execution, somewhat detracted from the dishes.  The Merguez sausage was delicious, and paired well with the mustard, and the cucumber salad also paired well with the sausage, but overall, there was noticeably too much acidity among all the elements.  The accompanying pita bread got lost in the mix and needed to have been heated/toasted.  It  added a slight unpleasantness to the dish.  The mustard seed preparation (their take on chimichurri?) with the veal chop was great on the roasted potatoes, which by the way were perfectly cooked, but did nothing for the chop, which actually needed nothing, because it was an awesome veal chop.  The greens, and I can't remember if they were kale or collard greens, because they were prepared like collard greens, were a bit bitter and mostly left on the plate.  After perusing the dessert menu, I just got frustrated because I was in the mood for something chocolate and simple and nothing like that was offered.  Instead, I went back to the hotel and had 3 (free) chocolate chocolate chip Otis Spunkmeyer cookies, which really hit the spot.  What can I say...~mdmd1~Maryland
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We tried this restaurant after checking out the good reviews and managed to score a table early in the evening before it became full. I ordered the Pumpkin Gnocchi which I personally did not like the taste of and found having to scrape the pumpkin pulp from the bottom of the pumpkin to incorporate with the unusual liquid inside just a little odd, however it was a creative looking dish. My main dish was Sole with another unusual creation of rice and an assortment of beans all combined in a liquid that I also found was not to my taste. Sometimes one can just order the wrong dishes and I found myself wishing I had ordered the Chicken or Beef, and since this was the first time at this Restaurant I was not aware just how creative the Chef is.   It was full by the time we left so obviously a very popular place and the Waiter was excellent and spent the time to chat with us which made the disappointment in my meal hard to complain to him about and anyway he wasn't the Chef. It was pricey as others have said but would recommend checking it out for yourself if you are passing through the area.~Liz12013~Trenton, Canada
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for our 31st anniversary. Food was great! A lot of local products used to feed us.  Service was just amazing! We will be back!~herovb~Upstate New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were greeted upon entering and the top notch service continued until we left.  The staff was professional,  friendly and attentive throughout the whole dining experience.  The food was prepared very well and served attractively.  We will definitely return.~mwb2042~Schenectady, New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in town for one night and found this restaurant on line. The service was excellent  and the food was awsome.~Jack S~Corunna, Ontario, Canada
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great place in Utica. Pleasantly surprised with this place. Great food and amazing service! People who care about ingredients and not too fussy. Had a great sole special, a chocolate dessert that hit all the right notes. Extensive wine and beer selection. A great vibe -old building that used to be a tailor shop - small space - seats 40ish. Would go back when traveling through these parts again.~AMERinLON~New York City, New York
The Tailor and The Cook~2654313~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~this place has great food but is small and a little pricey would not be an everday thing speical ocssion~Donna M~Utica, New York, United States
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Appetizer - hot sweet peppers and garlic tasted great.  The dining room was sparse though - they could use professional decorating to give more atmosphere. The server we had Jeff was good, came around often.  We had a longer wait than we expected for the food but it was delicious when it finally arrived. Spiced lamb with a side of roasted cauliflower was excellent. The Ahi tuna with wasabi was delicious. The lemon cheesecake could have had a bit more lemon seasoning, but it was otherwise great. Fantastic meal here.~David J~Syracuse, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great Italian menu w/ several specials. Excellent servers; so nice & helpful with everything. Outstanding house-made desserts~Harris S~New York City, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great food and service but had to wait 45 for a table. Excellent atmosphere. Especially loved the chicken riggies and the appetizers. ~Ann K~New Hartford, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had very good food, drinks and as always the service was excellent. Can't wait ti go back very soon.~John W~Utica, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten here several times, and every time the appetizers and entrees are cooked to perfection, and the desserts are absolutely delectable.  Service is excellent as well.  My husband and I joke about the pristine and lonely salt and pepper shakers at the edge of the table, for which one never need reach, as the seasoning is always spot on!! Chef Luke is Johnson Wales trained like many celebrity chefs, and it shows on the plate consistently.  This is big city gourmet quality close to home for us, and we are so glad we found The Willows with a little help from Trip Advisor!!!~BBfoodie777~Ilion, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In addition to the regular menu there were 3 appetizer special features and a main course special feature.  My meal was expertly prepared and exactly as requested.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The dining room was subdued and comfortable -- very pleasant.  If you arrive a bit early, parking is easy; however, once the place starts to fill up parking can become a bit tight -- carpooling would help if you are in a larger party of people.~James C~Utica, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband and I went to The Willows for date night . We have never had anything but exceptional service and the food is hands down the best in central NY.  ~justlyl~Barneveld, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Recently dined at The Willows with a large group. It was highly recommended by several people.  After the experience you know why.  Our group began at the quaint bar (seating for approximately 12-14 at the bar and a few high tops.  The bartender mixed some excellent Martinis and other mixed cocktails. It is a full bar with plenty of draft & bottled beers.  During dinner we started with appetizers (family style). Calamari, greens and artichoke hearts all cooked to perfection. Fortunately we weren't provided bread (upon request) to allow room for the entrees.  Several people ordered the filet, Tuna, salmon and brodetto. All commented that the presentation, quality, texture and seasoning of each dish was outstanding. You won't be disappointed choosing "The Willows" as your next fine dining destination.~Dave D~Canandaigua, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Started with coquille st. Jacques which was so good we ordered seconds. The lamb was perfection. My boyfriends steak was delicious. We could not stop talking about our meal. Finished with chocolate ice cream with brownie and peanut butter, made in house! Best meal ever. ~Kendra T~Utica, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because the food itself is actually very good.  I had meatballs and chicken riggies, both were excellent.  However, the service was the worst I have ever experienced.  It took 2 HOURS to get our food.  My mother told me she experienced the same problem when she went there for Valentine's Day, only difference is I actually received my food and hers was forgotten.  Would never go back here.~Allison S~Sauquoit, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place is warm and inviting with a fireplace and  fresh flowers everywhere. We had the place to ourselves as they were kind enough to open for our occasion! Our children had decorated with  memorable photos and balloons,while thestaff had set up a large table for all of us and a great buffet table.  The service and food was excellent!~kathleenn707~Herkim
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant has it all, great food, great staff, great location!  Most restaurants are quiet at 5:30 pm, but this place was already busy. By the time we left, all tables were occupied and the bar was full.  The staff is very friendly and business like at the same time.  Our waitress knew the menu and was very helpful.  Our food was well presented, and very tasty.  We started off with their meatball appetizer and their greens.  Both were delicious. Our group had a strip steak special (excellent flavor, cooked perfectly), Veal Lukatelli - very good, and veal Francaise - also very good.  The restaurant is very clean, nicely decorated and inviting.  We would return!~hitthehighway~Upstate NY
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is our most favorite place to eat and we only go there for special occasions to keep it as special as it is. We try to get there once in the summer and once in the winter. The food is all cooked to order so be prepared to relax while you await the presentation of the meals. The wait is worth every second and the chef knows exactly how to create 5 star plates. Best. Restaurant. Around.~LovetoskiNewYork~New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant was superb! From the in-house baked bread,  appetizers to die for,  the selection of entrees and their presentation; everything was beyond our expectations and a real treat. A great experience to celebrate our 25th Anniversary. Hope you are fortunate to be served by BK, she is warm, polite, friendly and knowledgeable of the food offered,~Adkcamp~Indian Lake, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Walking in the door, the coat rack starts the attention to detail that you can follow through the entire restaurant. Our visit started in the bar with an extremely enlightened wine list. We were able to visit with one an other without shouting, always a plus. We then headed to our table right on time for our reservation. The service was incredible, our server knew the menu and was able to suggest exactly the right dishes! We started with the calamari and greens(hot) both perfect, with the homemade bread to cool the palate! For me the duck (heavenly), my wife the filet (like butter), and the seafood riggies & ahi tuna w/orange ginger sauce for my brother and his wife which by their account were excellent!! We had to pass on desert, choosing to return to the bar to drink our desert! Our time at The Willows was Quality! The attention to the smallest detail made our entire experience phenomenal! We will go back again and again!! ~Eissensday~New Hartford, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We all enjoyed dinners were played beautifully...and tasted excellent! Lamb, egg plant, chicken Brian ... all excellent!  Wait staff superb! Definitely a must try!~Kathleen C~Utica, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here on this visit due to another local restaurant being completely incompetent. We knew if we came here it would be great...as it always is. The Willow's did not disappoint!  Service is top notch and the food is outstanding. Best salmon in the area!  Love it!!~Michele0101~Central New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went here based on recommendations and positive reviews on this site.   Negatives -  Waited over 30 minutes for drinks to come to our table ( 1 draft, lemonade, sparkling water and a soda ) We did not order appetizer and we still Waited over an hour for entrees.  Very loud dining room   Positives Friendly staff Food was very good   We have eaten at many fine dining restaurants so I understand that sometimes waiting for your food is a normal occurrence but that usually happens when you are being served several courses.  We just waited an excessive amount of time for everything.   I don't like to leave negative reviews and I prefer to support local businesses.  We loved the food but we all regretfully agreed that the service could use some improvement.   ~David D~Whitesboro, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went there with limited high hopes but as soon as we arrived we took the limited off.  The bartender was exceptional and had suggestions on the wine.  The hostess was extremely friendly and accommodating. Our waiter David was exceptional. From knowing everything about the wine list, to the menu and very attentive but not bothersome.  Now the food...It was wonderful.  The Ahi Tuna was very well prepared, the haddock was also very well prepared. The calamari was good, it was tender, but I prefer a little less breading.  All in all a great time. We will definitely return.~ReneeGourmet~Lyons Falls, New York
The Willows~2314801~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went to the willows last Friday and was just blown away with our meal. One of my friends suggested this place because she had such a great dinner here. We started with the calamari. It was the tenderest I have ever eaten. I then ordered the tuna and from the presentation to the last bite I couldn't have been happier.  My friends and I can't wait to get back there! ~justlyl~Barneveld, New York
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Excellent breakfast and very good bagels and also coffee. I would recommend if you pass near by, specially with cream cheese.~Marco P~Lisbon, Portugal
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great coffee darker roast than most American and good scones and pastries.  Recommended if you want a European style coffee.~Steve S~Canberra, Australia
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I respect that this is an effort at fair trade.  The coffee was good but not great.  Pastries mainstream.  Reminded me of Starbucks.  No complaints but also nothing to write home about.~Nancy S~Denver, Colorado
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've had almond croissants before and this by far the best ever. Light and flaky, loaded with flavor. Very nice place. ~Mrsym2~Dalton, Georgia
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you want a GOOD cup of coffee in a country that drinks dish water and calls it coffee then go to The thinking cup! Proper coffee at last!~Victoria C~London, United Kingdom
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love this place!  Warm, cozy little coffee house, with friendly staff.  Stayed up on Beacon Hill and went here every morning for just the best coffee!  Start your day right here, or stop for a pick me up later.~Randy H~Encinitas, California
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really nice breakfast with yoghurt & fruit and I had a egg-muffin but if the Thinking Cup is nr.1 of Boston I'm glad we did not visit the other coffee shops.Some new chairs would also be a good idea...~Bert W~Doetinchem, The Netherlands
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Small establishment on Newbury Street with some outside seating for summer days. Unusually they do not have table service, just pop inside and make your choice from the counter and order your tea, coffee etc. Good cake selection.~Peter E~Everleigh, United Kingdom
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Thinking Cup really does have the best coffee, and it seems to be consistent across outlets too, as they have three in Boston. I had a small double shot latte, which is the closest you can get to an Australian Flat White, and it was perfect. Strong, flavoursome and no bitterness at all. I was surprised at the range of fruits and cereals you can have for breakfast there. It was certainly enough for us. My wife had steel cut oats with a selection of extra toppings. I had a very nice plain croissant, and we sat at a small table by the window in the busy but intimate setting. If you want good coffee, go to a Thinking Cup!~Les_Landau~Canberra, Australia
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The hotel recommended this coffee shop / snack bar. Really good food, full of locals. Right on the Common. Not expensive but quality.~ARG191~Sligo, Ireland
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Thinking cup's coffee is pretty average-- but it's their food that keeps me coming back. I love their breakfast quiche, and their "make your own" grilled cheese is also worth checking out. I often come here alone to grab a coffee to-go, or for short business meeting  with colleagues.~Julia G~Boston, Massachusetts
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This small cafe has a big heart and what must be the best hazelnut latte in the US! In addition, they have lactose free milk and gluten free bread. Most whims are catered for by very friendly staff. I really look forward to having another breakfast there very soon!~S9599RDmike~Geneva, Switzerland
Thinking Cup~1980452~Boston~Massachusetts~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were in Boston for the first time and what a find on our last day...Thinking Cup!  Best cup of java ever - the coffee is outstanding (got coffee beans to take with) and a delicious breakfast to boot!! Recommend it highly - lovely service as well!~BillAndRobin1019~Chicago, Illinois
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Based on all of the positive reviews we made this restaurant our top pick. If you like snooty staff, hour long waits and lackluster food, this is your place. Certainly the brunch set. If you want to experience Seattle as a local, walk two doors down to the gritty The 5 Points Cafe. I cannot even find this place on Trip Advisor. It is one of the oldest and longest running bars and cafes in the city. They advertise that they've been overcharging tourists since 1929 ;) The tattooed wait staff are incredibly friendly, service is fast, but most important, the food is amazing! This will be our regular place each time we visit Seattle. So skip Tilikum unless you made reservations well in advance, like to whisper when you talk, and overpay for ok food. ~UtahTravelMomof1~Salt Lake City, Utah
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great for those that love fine dining/ foodie experience. Their menu changes based on what is in and their specials for the evening go quickly! The chicken is a staple and never leaves the menu due to popularity. The food and service is GREAT! Be sure to get the noodle/pasta appatizer. Like a light white sauce to noodle with a sweet nut finish.~MooreTravelers~Fort Wayne, Indiana
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had an eggs benedict and bloody Mary on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Friendly staff and great food. Definitely recommend this place.~bourkie100~Limerick, Ireland
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Having been to Tilikum many times over the past 3+ years, it remains consistently exceptional, friendly and noteworthy.  For some reason (?) I never tried the French onion soup until August.  Wow!  Enemy in August that soup was spectacular.  At my next visit I had halibut (over corn something or other) that was so good I almost went back the next evening for an encore.  Reservations recommended.  Very much worth planning ahead.  ~Margaret j~Seattle, Washington
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been having quite a few mediocre meals lately which has led me to give some less than stellar reviews. That all changed this afternoon. I arrived in Seattle having flown in from Philadelphia.  By the time I got to the hotel it was about 1 PM in Seattle, 4 PM "my time" and I hadn't really eaten.   I had read in advance about Tilikum Place Cafe  when I searched for restaurants convenient to my hotel. In this case, it was only a block and a half away.  I decided to forgo my usual lunch trip to Pike Place Market and give this a try. I'm glad I did!   The food was excellent. You can tell there's somebody in the kitchen who really cares about what is served.  Even the iced tea is "cold brewed" so that it actually taste like tea should, not the watery mixture you get from most commercial brewing machines.  I had read all of the recommendations about trying one of the Dutch Babies but, since that takes about half an hour to bake, I started with some homemade lentil soup. It was one of the best I've ever had.  I ordered the savory version of the Dutch Baby which contains bacon, broccoli, leek and local cheddar cheese.  Although savory, it is served with a side of real maple syrup.  I found myself pulling off the fluffy edges and dipping them in the syrup.  Exceptional!  I travel and eat out extensively. I don't usually wax this enthusiastic about a restaurant.  Although it was only lunch, this was one of the better meals I've had in quite a while.  The service was excellent and my waiter was very knowledgeable. And, to top it all off, it only cost about $20.  This place deserves their reputation. I will be sure to be back next time I travel to Seattle.~PhillyPod~Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was visiting the Space Needle and needed to kill some time before the Emp museum opened. I saw a McDonalds across the street, but decided a short walk normally reveals a better breakfast. I knew the Tilikum Place cafe was well regarded as there were people queuing out the door. It seems as a single business traveller I was very lucky to eat without a reservation as almost all the tables and places at the counter had been pre-booked. I liked the vibe of the place, it was simple decor with an open kitchen and varied clientele - everyone welcome I guess. Service was initially slow waiting about 15 minutes before being offered a drink. I was in no rush, but it felt a little too long to be attended too. However once my order was taken, my drinks and food were delivered very quickly. I had the omelette and the flavours with the homemade ketchup were amazing, well worth the waiting time. A couple sat next to me at the counter forced me to try the Blueberry Dutch Baby pie and it was delicious. A great experience and amazing I was able to stumble across and get a table in such a high regarded restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place, just relax and go with the Sunday morning brunch vibe - the food is worth it!~zpme~Reading, United Kingdom
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really good food. Pretty good prices. Great waitstaff, very friendly, prompt. My meal was fresh and very tasty. ~TanikaWeber~Russiaville, Indiana
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sunday Brunch at Tilikum Place Cafe is a smart idea because Sundays are lower traffic days at the Needle and Chilhuly, both just a short walk away. We were really looking forward to eating there and the eatery easily met all of our expectations for an eclectic, delightful meal in beautiful surrounds.   My husband enjoyed the TPC's Breakfast Platter...so good!!...and I generously shared my fantastic Dutch Pancakes (lemon!) with him. Service was excellent and the locale perfect for pictures.  You need to make a reservation for the weekend event, though.  The place fills up fast.  5 stars!~Bernadette  Z~Colorado Springs
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The whole experience was wonderful.  Great menu selections ( I recommend the chicken) and friendly staff with a very cozy atmosphere~hopdickson~Bellevue, Iowa
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This cafe is 5 minutes walking from our hotel so we dropped in for a light meal. What a find. Absulutely delicious food and a very nice wine list too. Staff were excellent, took the time to chat with us. Overall, a very pleasing experience.~shazza98~Gisborne, Australia
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a great little cafe, close to the Space Needle, that offers a very tasty brunch.  Unique menu items, and a very homestyle feel.~Chonchmobile~Vancouver, Canada
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a small restaurant on a quiet side street that is a 10-minute walk from the Space Needle and the Monorail Center. Reservations advised because it is a small space.  Get there early if you would like to have one of the tables near the windows. Although the menu is limited all the items on the menu are well prepared and the server was very knowledgeable about the preparation and all the ingredients of each item. I had a delicata squash salad with a vinaigrette. The flavors were balanced and the presentation was perfect. For a mains I had locally caught halibut.  For dessert our server comfortable cozy setting.~Rosslyn H~New York
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This unassuming cafe, tucked amidst showier restaurants is not to be missed.  I dined for Sunday brunch and even arriving at 8:45 am, reservations are needed.  Yet, even with the cafe buzzing at full capacity, the meal was served leisurely and service was pleasantly unrushed.  The food is spectacular. And my only regret is not ordering more off the special's menu as my waiter suggested.  Never having been interested in crumpets before, I took his advice and the fluffy, slightly buttery with a hint of sweetness treat is now a breakfast favorite I will hunt for.  The dutch baby and baked eggs were very good too. We had a very pleasurable dining experience that we felt lucky to find on our trip to Seattle.~RikkiP~Dallas
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Took a group of six of our friends and had both excellent food and great service. A small restaurant with an appropriate sized menu and fresh seafood specials. Add a reasonable wine list with fair pricing and it adds up to great night out. the restaurant is small and not loud so the ambiance was good. the special, grilled Black Cod was prepared perfectly and tasted great.  Worth a revisit and we will!~Steve M~Bothell
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We arrived when the restaurant opened at 11:00 AM.  There was already a line waiting to get into the restaurant.  We were seated quickly and our waiter was prompt in supplying menus.  In addition, he carefully noted the specials that were available that day.  I had a traditional American breakfast with eggs, potatoes, sausage and toast together with a nice coffee.  It was excellent in every way.  My partner had a salad of some sort that was very fresh and tasty according to her.  Service was attentive without being obtrusive.  This restaurant was recommended by a family member who is a food and wine expert. We did not sample any wines but I did look at their list and found it impressive.  The prices were moderately high.~LLion~El Dorado Hills, California
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We spotted this place whilst we were to be honest a little lost this was at lucnhtime and it was buzzing, so back at our hotel we rang a booked a table for evening meal. the inside is not overly big so i think you should pre book, but the guy who served us was extremly knowledgable about the food and i wanted to try oysters  and had picked the baked ones from the menu for starters which he said was a great choice for someone who had never had the before, my husband had the french onion soup and both had fish of the day. great place great food great staff and service can highly recommend~cnomis~Chorley, United Kingdom
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were looking for a nice place to eat near our hotel and Tilikum was recommended by the front desk manager.  I checked the reviews on Trip Advisor and we walked over.  We had the boiled oysters, Hubby had the pork chop, I had the scallops.  Wonderful!!  Perfectly prepared!  It was pricy, and the view across the street is not pretty, but the service and food made up for the location.~Tennismel57~Alexandria, Virginia
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went for lunch, without a reservation and fortunately they managed to give us a table for 2 as long as we agreed to be out within an hour. We ordered a soup and sandwich combo ($9), the moroccan chickpea soup was very good and the brie and apple sandwich, which tasted like tuna and tomato, was quite edible. The staff were welcoming and pleasant enough and the place was at near capacity but I found it lacked any atmosphere beyond 'hohum'. Not sure I'd go back, it was OK but didn't provide anything to draw me in.~ianjj~Kitchener, Canada
Tilikum Place Cafe~1516303~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went last night and the food was fabulous.  Started with drinks, many of which were based on a Manhatten.  Kind of pricy ($12) but lots of alcohol and really fine.  We had the BLT salad, greens salad, chicken quinoa soup, French onion soup, chicken and pork chops.  All were very tasty and well presented. Finished with the Profiteroles which I could live on.  Our waitress, Sarah, was extremely knowledgeable and had opinions about the dishes that we appreciated.  She was also like having a good friend over at her home for dinner.  One of the members of our group works in the food industry and even she was very impressed.  This place is truly amazing.~Chris L~Seattle, Washington
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~At 2:00 PM on a weekday, we still had to wail almost 30 minutes for a table, but it was worth every second.  Excellent food with helpful, excellent service.  Not much more to say except try it yourself. Menu was lots of variations on food you think you have tried before, but you will find out you really have not.  Will go out of our way to go back the next time we are near Portland.~Alan S~mesa, arizona
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Breakfast is absolutely fantastic.  Tasty, attractively presented.  And for me, the best part is that my dog could go in also.  Water and food is available for our canine friends.~travlkar1~Rockaway Beach, Oregon
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious food, awesome staff and they are dog friendly!   Definitely try the biscuits and potato pancakes.  The six of us ordered a different breakfast plate and they were all wonderful!~NurseSueA~Willows, CA
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Following two nights of fair to good dining we chose the Tin Shed Cafe for breakfast our third day in Portland. We weren't so sure about the place when we found it but it turned out to be an excellent choice. The staff and clientele were a mix of old and young, hippy and conventional. Many were accompanied by their dogs who snuggled up under the tables. But the service and food were really good. Highly recommended!~Westm44~Miami
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Is that fun or what...dogs can sit on the patio.  ;-)  Super yum yum potatoes and more...this is great food and an outing with your mutt. Only in Portland, right? ;-))~Julie L~Portland, Oregon
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Last stop before PDX and home to SAN. Just close enough to the airport...  Not busy and slid right into a table. The biscuits were awesome and mac 'n cheese inspired with olives and tomatoes.  Nice...~vsbrinkman~San Diego, California
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Local fresh farm vegetables and herbs, organic meat and careful preparation by people who know what they are doing is the hallmark of this place. Everything was big on flavor and we were all left not only satisfied by more than please with our selections. They even have a doggie menu for the garden so you can have dinner with your pet. Great place!!!~Quinta53~Las Vegas, Nevada
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Lovely comfortable place for a lazy get together or filling meal. Good selection and options for vegetarians/vegans. Dog friendly with a doggie menu. They get served a bowl of water upon seating. Got pretty busy and you may have to wait for a seat but worth it. Friendly staff.~TracyDan102013~Dubai, United Arab Emirates
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Parking is not good , more like awful, but the short walk is well worth it.  Atmosphere is eclectic and extremely friendly. Food is second to none .. ~kygregor~Aurora, Colorado
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tin Shed & Garden Cafe is in the 'arts' district residential area of Portland.  We arrived shortly before 8pm and were able to get seated quickly.  They don't take reservations. It is a rather small location and there are long waits at peak days/times.  Dogs are welcome and we saw several with their pets laying at their feet.  This restaurant was featured on Guy Fieri's "Diners Drive-Ins and Dives" show on the Food Network.  He specifically featured the Heartless Artichoke sandwich. I tried it and can see why it was featured.  It is a heavenly concoction of artichoke hearts, mayo, garlic, lemon, red peppers, parmesan on a grilled sourdough bread.  Absolutely a must try! I also had a cup of the chicken tortilla soup which was excellent.  Husband had the blackened salmon burger which he enjoyed.  I sampled it as well and it was very good.    Add to your list of must try restaurants in Portland....you won't be disappointed!~smariel~Coppell, TX
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Told we'd have a 45 min wait on Sunday morning (actually was less) but nice walking area to explore or you can have a cup of coffee while you wait. Food was good (large portions) and great Bloody Marys! Wait staff is friendly and willing to make exceptions on the menu. I wanted one of the scrambles without the burrito and that was no problem. Very casual atmosphere and worth the wait. Patio dining during nice weather.~Susan P~Puyallup, Washington
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Travelling from Canada and always love PDX for some the best restaurants on the West Coast :)  Had a great late night dinner here with vegetarian friends.  We just had dessert but their food looked amazing and the cake was delish!  Highly recommend~Shelby H~Kelowna, Canada
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Unfortunately I think The Tin She'd Cafe is an acquired taste and I'm not sure if I have acquired that taste yet. We arrive (party of 4) approx. 3PM on a Sunday afternoon. When we arrived we encountered a bit of a wait (as we had expected from reading reviews as well as seeing the line out the door most days we pass by). The wait wasn't because there weren't any tables available. There were multiple tables available both in the inside patio section as well as inside the bar area. Better organization and a more attentive staff should have been able to seat people as they came in but that wasn't happening.  Once we finally did get seated the waitress was nice and attentive. She did point out the happy hour menu, took our order and brought our food but my wife and I did pick up that she wasn't in a very good mood by her comments during conversation/small talk with us.  Food: I guess I have different thoughts on what is excellent food and what is ok food. Yes it tasted good (had 2 chicken tacos, salmon cakes, chicken sandwich and bolognese pasta dish) but we all didn't feel it was amazing omg gotta have again...  Ambiance/atmosphere: dogs...a lot of dogs. I get that it is nice to go out and have a meal with your pet. The Tin Shed caters to dogs (even offering dog meals, bowls and other things to keep ur furry friend happy). While we were there 1 dog continued to bark loudly at other dogs, there was a minor dog scuffle between a couple dogs. Wet, dirty, dog smell is not too appealing.  Overall food was just ok, wait wasn't necessary, staff was nice/friendly but a little disorganized. I think if we do go back we will try to make it to the Breakfast/brunch option to see if we have a better overall experience.~Tom G~Sherwood, Oregon
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were looking for some local flavor and we found it at the tin shed cafe. Located in the Alberta Art district the neighborhood was fabulous. The restaurant had its own charm with a patio area and inside location. The menu was diverse in that it offered gluten free, vegetarian and meat options. Don's miss having the biscuits with anything - they were awesome. If you are looking for a unique place in Portland - look no further. It was a reasonable uber ride from airport area!~sylvia k~Cypress, California
Tin Shed Cafe~439825~Portland~Oregon~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great treat to start the day. The Salm I Am was awesome. Our service was friendly and efficient and coffee was nice for a cool Portland morning. You can't go wrong stopping here to start your day.~Kayaktherogue~Boynton Beach, Florida
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A terrific cafe, excellent and cheerful staff, delicious food, definitely a place to visit! We came here two years ago and vowed to go back. Wasn't disappointed !~Hilary B~Oakville
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Driving from Buffalo to Boston along the I90. We pulled off the highway in Utica and stopped at the Welcome Center to ask about restaurants with "all day breakfast". The woman recommended Top of the Morning Cafe. So glad she did! I have bad food allergies...our server took the time to answer all my questions and she went into the kitchen to read ingredient labels. The food was so good. Servings are huge! You will not be disappointed!!~colebenn1~Ontario, Canada
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friendly staff, delicious food and lots of it!!  Very good coffee.  A good crowd when we were there so of course we knew it was going to be good when we first walked in!!~nytonj~Ithaca, New York
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great little place for breakfast! The menu is great, the service is very friendly, and the food is very very good! I would definitely recommend it here! ~Shannon K~Utica, New York, USA
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I googled "best breakfast in Utica" and this popped up and man was Google right. The food was awesome. Prices extremely reasonable. I didn't think breakfast was one of those meals that really mattered how it was cooked. Well it is, and this place proves it. ~2011president~williamstown, ma
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've never ordered something here I didn't like. The waitstaff is always very friendly and do not make you feel rushed. If you sit at the counter you'll control the remote for the tv.~Will D~Frankfort, New York
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's a great place to eat - can have breakfast any time.  Ample seating and nice atmosphere.  Great service.~swtstuff~Utica, New York
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It's out of my way, but if we're going out to a diner this is always the place I want to be! The servers are wonderful and the food is great!  ~William P~Clinton, New York
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loved this place! Nice and clean and easy to access and the food is great!!  The wait staff is attentive w/o being overbearing and knows their menu & helped with recommendations. I had a huge corned beef has omelet and I had to take half home.  I was salivating at some of the menu choices, like fried bologna....oh, yum and childhood memories wrapped into one. The lunch menu looked great, so did the desserts. We're gonna come back for sure!~Ellesor826~Parrish, Florida
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice neighborhood cafe offering some good food. Great friendly service. My breakfast was very good and very expensive, way more than normal. That is reason enough not to return. All other aspects were favorable.~4bird1~Kingston Springs, Tennessee
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Portions were very generous, the taste was decent but nothing remarkable. Our waitress seemed to be a bit distracted and inattentive, but "the regulars" we sat next to said they rarely miss a Sunday breakfast there and savor every bite.~851debran~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Really good breakfast/brunch spot. The food is very good. The people I go with really like the giambotte. I usually get eggs, toast and home fries - all good. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. ~Colleen_QZ~New York
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Staff was friendly, relaxed (you could read that as also being a bit inattentive as we waited a good ten minutes for just a cup of coffee), and food was good enough to satisfy us before we headed back onto I-90. The Caesar Chicken wrap had an off-putting addition of black olives, but the fries were good and crispy and peppery. Portions are large, the staff knows and chats with their regulars, the dining area is large, airy, and tables are not listening-to-your-conversation close. Great place with moderate prices to make a breakfast or brunch stop, whether you are Irish or not!~Clubess1~Long Beach, New York
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Top of the morning cafe opens early, 6 AM every day except Sunday when it opens at 7 AM.  My wife really enjoyed her omelette on top of Italian greens served with a huge piece of ham.  I enjoyed a typical sausage and eggs meal, cooked exactly as requested.  Coffee and tea were of acceptable quality.~BobNepean~Ottawa, Canada
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good service and food.  Had home fries which were absolutely delicious.  Will certainly come back again.~Beth M~Clinton, NY
Top of the morning cafe~3330509~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Was passing through town and this was mapped as an easy off and on from I-90.  Was treated to a delicious breakfast that was plentiful and delicious. The service wasn't t the quickest, but we weren't in a hurry. Would definitely come back the next time I am in the area. Nice place for breakfast. Super convenient from the thru way. ~Scott S~Syracuse, New York
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~High quality gelatos, in popular and classic flavors. Greatly recommended, however, you will not find organic or artisanal options.~Comtesse_DEury~New York City, New York
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Homemade ice cream is my weakness!  This place is addictive!  Great homemade ice cream with some out of the ordinary flavors!   If it were easier to park in the area, I would be 20lbs heavier!~Susan R~Jersey City, New Jersey
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Homemade ice cream, shakes and cakes...All year long! The only thing missing is parking, otherwise it would be 5 stars!~AldenCal~Jersey City, New Jersey
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really was creamy and smooth. It was just a wee bit sweet for my palate and the cherries in the cherry vanilla were not of the maraschino type which I would have preferred but it was yummy nonetheless.  Not only was it kid friendly they had lines out the door literally. Score again, we found the secret walk up window and felt like stealth superheroes when we bypassed the interior line. They have a multitude of flavors for every taste from avocado, to soursop, to plain old vanilla and chocolate.  A must do after park or after dinner stop w the kiddos. ~Suzana K~Dallas, Texas
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been going to Torico's all my life. It's wonderful & service is great.  I love to support long time local establishments & this one is a real treat!~MKTravels1~Jersey City, New Jersey
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I've been going to Torico's for 18 years, and honestly never had better ice cream anywhere.  Its not surprising that much of Jersey City has discovered what used to be a bit of a secret.  Flavors like pumpkin pie, Almond joy, and Coffee w/Oreos keep us torn about the best flavors.  I'm not sad about the somewhat high prices, and often long lines, because otherwise we would go there far too often.  Our favorite treat is ordering a "taster", with 8 balls of icecream.  You have to order in advance, but its a great deal for a family, and allows everyone to get their favorites.~Mimi L~Jersey City, New Jersey, United States
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of my favorite spots in JC. Great gelato and home-made ice cream. I would say that my favorite things about Torico's is that you can order custom-made ice-cream cakes and pies (not just with the basic flavors--no--any of their special delicious flavors can be included). Love Torico's!!~Kelly B~Jersey City, New Jersey
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Some of the best ice cream you will ever have.  Homemade on site.  I taste tested the coconut almond and got a coop of the chunky cherry.  I would put this ice cream up against anybodies!!~mapacho~Daphne, Alabama
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The staff was awesome; the ice cream, delicious. Great texture and flavor. The banana is great. Hard to find in Boston, the vanilla fudge is outstanding.  A great place in wonderful Jersey City. ~MedfordMA~Medford, Massachusetts
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are hundreds of delicious flavors and the staff is super friendly. You can try so many options that you end up not knowing which one you liked the most.~angyny04~Jersey City, New Jersey
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are only two problems with Torico's: the price and the long lines on weekends. Everything else is perfect.  Torico's has more flavors than you can count, all homemade and all delicious. There are some exotic ice creams if you're looking for something new (lychee, avocado, tamarind, ube, black sesame) but they also do the classics really well (strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, mint chip). No matter what you're in the mood for they have it. Not sure what you want? Spend some time tasting the different flavors - just don't take too long. The people in line behind you will get annoyed.   You can stop in for a cone or buy ice cream in pints. If they don't have the flavor you want ready to sell they're more than happy to box some up for you. Torico's servers are always friendly and helpful.   If I *had* to pick flavors you should definitely try it would be the coffee royale, chocolate marshmallow, blueberry cheesecake, and green tea. Just make sure you don't try them all in one visit. Trust me, you'll be going back.~Alec W~New York City, New York
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They have so many tropical flavors (lychee, avocado, soursop, jackfruit, tamarind, ube, and more aside from the regular flavors.  Those behind the counter are always ready to explain the flavors and ask you if you want a taste. I always take my visitors here. It is a gem in Jersey City and very close to the path train.~Charing~NJ
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They make fresh creamy ice cream and gelato in this local store.  Plenty of toppings or just dig into a scoop. Yummy!~bluerussian~jersey city nj
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is a great place to grab some ice cream. They even have a walk-by window to order. You could use the window when you can't go inside the shop. Like in case you have a dog or a very large baby stroller.~Ira L~Jersey City, United States
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Torico is a great spot for ice cream when you're walking around town. You pay a lot for an average tasting ice cream. I feel it's more for the experience than anything else. Reminds me of Applegates in Montclair: Average ice cream but people keep going for the experience. I wish they would make it better tasting so that I would feel it's worth over $6 for 2 scoops.~BahamaMama3~Montclair, NJ
Torico Homemade Ice Cream~4371781~Jersey City~New Jersey~Certificate of Excellence 2016~best ice cream i have had in ages! great variety, great flavors. busy, but worth the wait. right off main street. easy to get to and soooo good.~djh5723~Chicago, Illinois
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A cool, hip hangout with a fresh NOLA-esque menu and trendy people watching. Candles climb the walls and blown glass lighting drip from the ceiling opposite a bank of windows to the street. Music, booth seating, and bar-centric atmosphere make it more a lounge than a restaurant.~Harry S~Yuba City, California
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Another wonderful place for breakfast. All that Cajun food that choices were hard but I know we all loved our meals accompanied by wonderful bloody Mary's. Staff were attentive and guided us with our choices and then followed up several times taking good care of us. Very fun experience with very good food.  ~StevePeggy~Minnesota
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Came here late night after an event, and was really impressed with the energy and vibe of the restaurant.  It was a Thursday night around 10 PM and it was definitely lively.  I went however mostly to grab dinner and actually had a hard time deciding.  The menu itself is massive.  There are straight up French bistro classics and then there are Creole offerings.  There are plenty of steak options and a ton of seafood selections.  The list of cocktails and wines is extensive. I went with a bottle of Burgundy wine and a wild boar bolognese (so hitting the Italian vibe as well) and it did not disappoint.  The service was courteous, helpful and warm.  All in all, it was a solid experience.~Mark B~New York City, New York
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Enough people have written about how great the Creole food is for me to add much insight. It should be noted, though, that Toulouse Petit has a surprising wine list, with a lot of vintage champagnes and an interesting selection of both Old and New World wines. The service staff are very friendly, but they clearly haven't been given much of a primer on the wines they are supposed to be selling. All in all a good experience, though.~JPK_YVR~Vancouver, Canada
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had great food, creole style in a busy and quirky venue. The experience of flavors was very enjoyable ~AndreBCN~Barcelona, Spain
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Hubby and I went here for Sunday brunch. Lots of people milling around in front, waiting for their name to be called. We were told it would be 30 minutes and that's exactly the time we waited. Not a big place but they have used the space wisely, with nice booths, high top tables, and "regular" tables throughout. Once seated we were able to order our "breakfast" cocktails - a Creole Bloody Mary for me (nice and spicy), and a Kentucky Mule for hubby. He said his had a real kick, mine was okay. The brunch menu has some amazing offerings - I ordered the fried oyster and bacon Benedict - don't knock it til you've tried it!), and I asked to switch out the potatoes for avocado - good choice on my part. Hubby chose the ham and Gruyere omelet...he said "Meh!" We also shared a small plate of beignets - wonderful light pillows of goodness, dusted with powdered sugar and served with a coffee dip. I passed on the dip - not a coffee fan, but hubby loved it. He also had their french press coffee and loved it. Wonderful service and servers - we will be back! No reservations are taken for the bunch, but you can call for lunch and dinner reservations. Visbeek was our server/ very attentive!~wearymom3~Seattle, Washington
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I want to go back. This place has amazing food. I cant exactly remember what the name of my breakfast dish but it was a signature dish. ~Aroog~Phoenix, Arizona
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for? This restaurant is great for Creole/French inspired foods. You must try the fried green tomatoes with Dungeness crab. The atmosphere is great. It is a dimly lit restaurant with votive candles that are lit daily. Although it is upscale, it is casual at the same time.  Oh, and it stays open late to experience great food late in the evening.~JustAce2015~Seattle, Washington
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Second time here for a week day breakfast. I love the homemade english muffins. The atmosphere is lovely and makes me feel like I'm in New Orleans. I hear there are line ups on the weekends so if you can get in during the week it might be easier to get a table.~terrionly~Langley, British Columbia
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pancakes were so delicious! One of the best pancakes I ever ate. Also the bacon was great. I was there for breakfast only. The prices were okay. The staff were really nice.  ~peetah21~San Juan, Puerto Rico
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place is gorgeous...full of European ambiance. But then there are two big screens that dominate the room.  One or two of our plates were brilliant, but then there were a couple that fell short. Our waiter was properly polite and attentive, but brought the appetizer after our salads and opened the wrong bottle of wine, which we drank anyway...it was all fine. But it could have been great. The grilled prosciutto-wrapped asparagus was inspired, perfectly sauced and topped with a perfectly poached egg. But the braised rabbit on pappardelle was bland and watery. It only achieved excitement when I encountered several bones. With the stunning number of excellent restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood, let alone in the Seattle area, I would give this place a pass. Maybe the huge TVs are distracting the staff too.~John F~Shoreline, Washington
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There were 5 of us..... booth table with plenty of room. Menu was varied with Cajun style. Our. Wait Person was fantastic...... Magdalena. She made to night so much more friendly and enjoyable.~Picture468~Sydney, Australia
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was a great place to eat, and obviously very popular with the locals, as it was packed by the time we left~Gerald E~Helensvale
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate breakfast and dinner in this restaurant. The food was excellent and the menu vast and varied. It would be best to book for dinner (although we managed to get a table without a reservation, but I think we were lucky). There is a large range of wines and spirits. The service was good as was the atmosphere. We would recommend this restaurant.~YorkshireWendy~Yorkshire
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had eggs benedict and while it was very good,  I still carry the memory of that dish 40 years ago that I thought was the best ever.    This is a high end restaurant and it offers a unique dining experience,  so one will find there is a wait as It is so popular.    It appears to have a local following that keeps the waitresses hopping.~4cents-worth~Grants Pass, Oregon
Toulouse Petit~1635070~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~While in Seattle for a wedding, we tried this restaurant because it was recommended by the bride and groom.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Living in southeast Texas, we know what good cajun food tastes like due to our proximity to Louisiana.  Everything we had here was top notch.  The cauliflower soup, french onion soup, Crawfish Andouille, and Halibut Pistachios were outstanding.  However, the favorite item we ordered was the Crawfish Beignets.  Go to Toulouse Petite Kitchen and Lounge just to have those, if nothing else!  We were there on a Friday night, and the bar scene was hopping.  It seems to be a favorite for the locals.  Two soups, two appetizers, two entrees, a wine, and a beer was $105 before tip.  Worth every penny.~pickygirl09~Huntsville, Texas
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A visit to Trattoria Calabria is much more than dining out--it is an experience of fine food and friendship. There is a special warmth in the restaurant that makes you feel comfortable and you can sit back and truly relax and enjoy the experience.   Chef Danny cooks everything homemade and he serves it with a large portion of pride--and  he has every reason to be proud. He does a fantastic job.!  The food is to die for!! Service is outstanding.  Chef Danny is constantly checking with all those that are dining to be sure that everything is to their liking and if they have enough to eat--no one could ever finish all that Danny serves to each of his diners--everyone leaves with "Take Home" boxes.  It is important that you make your reservations early in the week so that you are not disappointed because the restaurant is already filled for the evening that you like to go there.~cvavo~Syracuse, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Five of us dined and laughed on end at Trattoria Calabria on 7/30/16.   Upon making the reservation, my wife was warned not to eat for the rest of the day. We shouldn't have eaten the day before either!    The rules;  1) Be on time 2) Don't ask for a menu  3) Bring your appetite and favorite bottle of wine  Then sit down and prepare to be fed and entertained by proprietor Danny and son Chris as they serve you fresh and beyond delicious homemade Italian specialties in quantities that couldn't be finished by the best of competitive eaters. All the while listening to the insight into their amazing dishes and dining concept.   To get things started we were served a tasty minestrone style soup followed by a massive straight-from-the-garden antipasto and huge bowl mussels bathed in a light tomato and garlic sauce (yes I drank the leftover sauce straight from the bowl). Next our eyes bugged out as we were delivered an entire pan of eggplant parmigiano along with a spatula and a knife to serve ourselves. My sister did the honors serving the tender eggplant with light, and once again, fresh tomato sauce with just a light amount of cheese. We did well, so I thought, polishing off more than half of the casserole and feeling very full we very content to call it a night.  Then the shock and awe...A more than generous serving of greens, beans, potatoes and spicy, but not too hot, sausage steeping in an amazingly flavorful chicken broth. I should have paced myself as this was my favorite dish of the night and I wished I could have eaten more. I waved my napkin in surrender.  On the canvas and hearing the judge count to ten, I think I am hallucinating when, with a thud, Danny drops the big one. A bowl, which at this point into my food coma looks to be the size of a sink, containing pasta and peas and meatballs. The meatballs were the best I can ever remember eating. The well cooked al dente shells in the now famous fresh tomato sauce added to my perfect bite when the peas were inside the shells.  This was the conclusion of the food portion of the evening but the conversation continued for a while longer and of course Danny and Chris felt like family members by the end of the night. Family style servings and the unmatched silverware, serving bowls and chairs added to the charming and intimate ambiance of once again eating in grandma's kitchen.   Grazie Danny and Chris, a presto!~JosephAIII~Matthews, North Carolina
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Food, ambience, service, price, everything was absolutely amazing. The owner Danny and his son we're great hosts. Danny told me that, "some people enjoy golfing or boating for a hobby, I enjoy cooking!"   We're all thankful that you enjoy it!~MrVD44~Central New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was our 31st anniversary and we are always up for an adventure, and the Trattoria Calabria did not disappoint. Dan and his son prepared an 8 course meal of Italian food that was reminiscent of my Sunday family meals at my grandparents home. The food was delicious and plentiful. We met some local people who frequent the establishment and ended up making friends. This is a family style dining experience and "not a restaurant". If you are looking for an adventure, than this is a perfect opportunity.~mlecuye1~Massena, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife decided she wanted to experience someplace different for dinner on her birthday. Checked TripAdvisor and we saw the glowing reviews, so we called for our reservation for 6:30. The atmosphere is definitely eclectic and you don't come here for a romantic dinner. You do come for the amazing food that chef Danny has been preparing all day just for you to enjoy. Everything from the soup to the bread, the mussels to the peas and pasta, the Italian meatballs and sausage to the eggplant parm was served with flair and perfect timing for the next course. Portions were very generous, and we went home with several good meals yet to come!  Get over not having a menu (it is a true trattoria) and just enjoy an authentic Italian dinner that is out of the park good! Can't wait to come back! We went  to Italy a few summers ago and can't remember enjoying a meal this much!~ScotIoset~Hamilton, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~No menu, it's up to Danny's discretion.  The food just keeps coming and coming.....everything EXCELLENT.  Start w/ homemade soup, a nice antipasto, bruschetta.  Then comes some steamed mussels, pasta w/ meatballs, eggplant parm, and finally a really nice baked chicken.  Great service, atmosphere, and you can BYOB!   (only thing missing was availability of wine glasses).   Great job Danny and son!   Reservations are required.~fletchlisa~Upstate NY
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Omg great  when you sit theres no menue you get what they serve and it is great food keeps coming bring your own wine but dont think your gonna get right in you have call a week ahead~junkmancometh~Utica, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Third visit since last Fall, three of us on a 75th birthday and were not let down by yet another fun time with fantastic food! Wow that chicken, and the mussels, such much food in relaxed atmosphere, thanks guys this was great!~JohnS1026~Cold Brook, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is a Utica restaurant worth finding.  We got on the road by 8:00 AM, from Dayton, Ohio to ensure that we would make our 7:00 PM reservation at Trattoria Calabria in Utica, NY.  The food is good and there is lots of it.  So that you don't doubt that everything is freshly made that day, Danny provides boxes and sends any leftovers home with you.  Danny and his son cook whatever is available that day.  Food is fresh and very much home-cooked.  I am half Italian and have spent approximately six months total in Rome.  While this isn't my grandmother cooking, Danny is, as another reviewer stated, my favorite uncle, from another region of Italy, behind the stove.  Tables are somewhat communal.  Everyone talks and shares stories of how and why they are eating at Trattoria Calabria that evening.  Be sure to take your favorite Italian red (no corkage fee), sit back, and enjoy your meal.  Price is very reasonable, too.  Note: You must make a reservation.  Danny needs to know how many to cook for.~PDfromDayton~Dayton, Ohio
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very nice but so odd to not gave a menu.  Trattoria is how meals done in Italy.  So u get 3 courses.  Soup, salad n pasta.  Food is excellent.  Has become so popular u primarily need reservations.~rainbowlake6~Utica, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had lunch today at the Trattoria. Be advised, they are only open for lunch now on Wednesdays. As other have mentioned, there is no menu, but you can get an idea of the type of food you will be served. Old fashioned, down-home Italian just like Grandma used to make. We started with iced tea, then came a delicious chicken soup and fresh Italian bread. A large fresh salad with homemade salad dressing, just right. Fabulous grilled cauliflower. A pasta and bean dish, as well as sausage and peppers. I had read about it, so I knew to skip breakfast and I am glad I did. We loved our lunch! The owner is an entertaining character and part of the ambiance. He puts his heart and soul in it, that was obvious. We saw him feed a bunch of hungry construction workers on lunch break in a half hour. It was a huge meal for what we paid, great value. We would most definitely return.~maliksmom~Utica, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We went for the 4th time and I can honestly say that Danny does not disappoint! From the delicious homemade soup to the FRESH salad and then the mussels (which I will only eat here), then eggplant parmigiana ( his son's specialty), then pasta and peas along with meatballs and sausage! I also forgot to mention the succulent chicken and the fresh hot buttered bread! WHEW!! It's always a feast when visiting here and Danny makes you feel at home!! You will need a reservation for sure--the Trattoria is always booked! Danny describes his restaurant style the best--just honest down-to-earth Italian home cooking! His hospitality and sense of humor make for an unforgettable dining experience! There is NO menu and that's just fine-- it's all good!! Trust me, you will come back again and bring more friends!!~markova47~Herkimer, New York
Trattoria Calabria~7189010~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~we so enjoyed eating here! took my parents for their 65th anniversary, we had the restaurant to ourselves as we had 22 family  members there!!~Mary Jo P~Sauquoit
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A casual atmosphere (especially enjoy sitting on outdoor patio) -- food is delicious. Particular favorites are the quinoa burger, panang curry and spaghetti squash.  Enjoy their honey lemonade as well.  It's a place where the food is fresh and you never feel hurried.  Highly recommend!~Jan B~Phoenix, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dr. Andrew Weils helped to establish the restaurant.  This restaurant started at this location years ago and now has many in other locations and states.  They source their ingredients locally and from local farms and organic when possible.  The restaurant cooks with the concept for healthy eating.  Menus is interesting and quite descriptive it includes many categories.  Since it was a treat I wanted to be conservation in my selection.  My friend ordered a bowl I ordered a salad.  The restaurant is airy has high ceiling, we sat outside for low noise.  I would definitely return and try more items.~healthyeater2013~Ferndale, Washington
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Fresh food . Nice flavors on everything from the menu. And.... You can get a drink!  The vegetable appetizers are soooo fresh.  Nice atmosphere,  casual and laid back.~David R~Phoenix, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been to True food many times.  The meals are always great and very fresh.  My go to favorite is the Panang Curry Bowl.  Super spicy with white breast chicken and vegetables.  I love that they use fresh local ingredients and cook without all of the lard and fat.  A truly healthy option.  Last time in I tried the steak tacos and they were also amazing!~Ann P~Phoenix, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was on a business trip and stayed across the street at The Camby. This was a very convenient location. The food was great as was the atmosphere.~Tootie903~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Joined by my wife, daughter, and granddaughter, we visited this place last night. I was somewhat apprehensive as I'm generally a meat and potatoes kind of diner.  I. was very pleasantly surprised.  Food selection was good. Products served were very fresh,  and flavors were wonderful.  Wait staff was friendly.   My daughter was disappointed in her "favorite" dish, a curried shrimp and noodles item.  It seems a few months ago, the restaurant changed the recipe. They offered to replace it with something else, but my daughter refused, saying "It's very good but not what it was".  All in all, a very pleasant dining g experience.  We'll go back.~michaeltheframer~Phoenix, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~LOVE the Organic Egg Sandwich on the Brunch Menu.  Egg, Turkey, Avacado and Lettuce on Fantastic Seeded bread.  My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and a Johnny Cake. So good we went twice this past weekend.~Diane M~Phoenix
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I met a friend of hers for dinner in late June. The meal was terrific and True Food continues to not disappoint. Giselle was our server and did a fantastic job of taking care of our table. We ordered several appetizers given the need to converse before having entrees. Food was great and service equaled the taste of the food. We will be back.~Prescott2007~Prescott, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife wanted to eat lunch here. I could tell by the name this may not be my cup of tea. We have a place back home like this and it's okay but not a place I suggest we go to. Anyway I have to admit the food is good but I didn't feel satisfied after our lunch. Probably  a great place for light eaters but just not my cup of tea. Service was average but I thought they could have been more helpful with the menu as I was struggling what to order. My wife enjoyed it very much the the 4 star rating. Myself, it was more of a 3. Glad we went because I know my wife goes to some restaurants with me that she's not that keen about either.~SmokiesJunkie~Fishers, Indiana
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of our favorite restaurants. We have the whole range in our family, including vegan, vegetarian, gluten intolerant, an pure carnivores.  True has something delicious for everyone. It's hard for me to order something other than the Bison Burger because it is awesome, but I do (on occasion). Definitely have a healthy specialty drink for starters.~Todd D~Phoenix, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The most amazing food.  Try everything on the menu at least once and the refreshing drinks are delish!~SoloTravelerReviews~Santa Barbara, California
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The summer salad was something I could eat all year long. Hubby had Chicken Curry dish that was really flavorful. I remained with veggies and head Spaghetti squash casserole. It was good, but overpriced. Flourless chocolate cake our friend ordered was declared to be not too sweet and husband's Chia pudding with bananas and coconut was my least favorite bite. The textures weren't good together with the coconut junks too crunchy, hard and dry.~vikitorisedona~Sedona, AZ
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner here last night and found the food to be deliciously different, fresh, and wholesome.  We started by sharing the seasonable vegetable salad which is a hot dish.  Terrific choice and we leave bed it.  I had the Lasagne which was also very good, while my wife had one of the chicken dishes which was similarly good.  We were too stuffed for dessert.~Neil S~NJ
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We met our family here for dinner recently and really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is bright and cheerful. The service was great. I had the spaghetti squash casserole and it was delicious.~sojouner2~Phoenix, Arizona
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You haven't given vegan/vegetarian cuisine a fair shake if you haven't been to True Food Kitchen. This is the BEST! Everything they serve is first quality, delicious and healthy.  Now if you aren't vegetarian don't worry, they serve lots of meats too but you just don't get amazing vegetarian selections anywhere. Vegetables aren't an afterthought here.    We ordered and went back for more it was so delicious!~dsrtgrl~San Diego, California
True Food Kitchen~1739339~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~came here twice for lunch after hiking nearby- incredible food. Fresh, healthy, good portions and reasonably priced. Loved the shiitake tofu lettuce cups and the edamame starter. Turkey burger and inside out burger were great with a nice option to split your sides (half sweet potato half kale salad) service was great - they're busy at lunch but we were seated within five minutes  Lots of great vegetarian options but also enough for a meat lover too. Wish we had this in our hometown. ~ZNJ_05~Toronto, Canada
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Did read all of the excellent reviews on best cupcakes etc. so decided to try while in the area. I stopped in on Monday got the red velvet mini cupcakes and one regular size red velvet cupcake just my opinion it wasn't anything special just an average cupcake! ~pamey25~Orlando, Florida
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every time we go to New York we go to this bakery. They have mini cupcakes and we buy them for the staff at the hotel we stay at. To say we are treated nicely is an understatement. I absolutely love their cherry scones and if you are a chocoholic their Brooklyn cake is to die for. You can't go wrong with any of their cakes. It is at trip well taking.  If you would walk any distance to get their you could even forget the calories!~CJAmemiya~Midland, Michigan
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I had almost given up on eating cheesecake just due to the quality differences at different restaurants but I knew I had to try it from the Two Little Red Hens and it exceptional.  We bought a 6" cheesecake for six of us and it was enough to fuel our dessert needs for several nights.  Neat little place, I wonder if they deliver?~gulf-to-gulf~The Dalles, ORegon, USA
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love two little red hen's it's one of my favorite reasons to go to the Upper East Side! The Marble Cake is to die for! Moist and delicious with amazing frosting.~nelliebeavers~New York City, New York
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My favorite cranberry scone yummy delicious, apple pay is very good!! Of course I highly recommended ~andali b~New York City, New York
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband found this place on a list recommending best cheesecake in NY so we thought we would give it a go. It is a little off the beaten track of the usual tourist haunts but it was worth making our way to this little place. The cheesecake was divine and probably the best I've eaten. It is a small place but we were able to eat in. The staff were friendly and it seemed a popular place for locals.~Crabcakeahoy~London, United Kingdom
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Probably my favorite dessert spot in the city. I'd recommend  the Boston Cream cupcake, but unfortunately it only comes out late afternoon. Their Key Lime pie and cupcake are both absolutely amazing when they have them. ~iJoeah~New York City, New York
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Tasty cakes from this diminutive space. Though sometimes their products wind up on the dry side, overall the place is a neighborhood mainstay that features cute and appetizing items.~Jeremy W~New York, New York, United States
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We made a point of trekking across Manhattan on a sweltering summer day to buy cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens and we were not disappointed for our efforts.   Everything looked amazing in the bakery; we tried the cherry cheesecake that night and the Brooklyn Blackout Brownie cupcakes. Everything was so incredibly fresh! We bought one 6" NY cheesecake to take home with us to Canada - the best souvenirs are the ones you can eat.  :)~Vuko68~Woodstock, Canada
Two Little Red Hens~1862362~New York City~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We was staying in w45 st and walked up, all I can say is wow, worth the walk, NY cheese cake was the best, better than juniors i would say and they serve up great cheese cake, it was that good that we came back for second slice lol, when we're back in NYC we're be Upto see you guys for round 3 ha ha.~Vickie w~Bexhill-on-Sea, United Kingdom
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~About to read the menu outside when a couple guys said to just go in - it's the best in town! Well they weren't kidding and it was "happy hour(s)". Great special pricing and never even looked at the regular menu, several items to choose from along with full bar. If you love sushi - you're in for a treat.~Deb M~Middleburgh, New York
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything about it was excellent from start to finish.  If I had to find something that was not perfect, I would say that the menu is too big!  Ha, hardly anything to complain about though!~684daveroberts~Olympia, Washington
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had the albacore belly sushi that was out of this world. Super fresh, tasty salmon, tuna, yellowtail and other ingredients are artfully paired in a smorgasbord of tasty rolls that are both colorful and delicious. Cool vibe in the restaurant as it is packed. Go there and you will see why it is so packed. Cool selection of daily offerings and sake make for a must do if you are looking for good sushi ~David D~Keller, Texas, United States
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have eaten in many cities around the world and eaten a lot of Japanese food. The waitress was abrupt and offered no recommendations when asked. The Omasake sashimi was cut so thick, and poorly cut. We spent about $150 for dinner and 2 drinks (together), and our $6 pizza we had on our walk home far exceeded the food at Umi Sake. Obviously, don't recommend.~diveclimb~Grimsby, Canada
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I think Umi has the best sushi in Seattle. They have a great happy hour that just cannot be beat! Plus great food, great service, and great atmosphere. The only downside is most of Seattle thinks this... so plan ahead.. the wait time can be a bit long!~EaganA003~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not sure why I had never been to this place, but what a pleasant surprise. From the great staff, to the interesting drink menu (good sake of course, but some great updates to classic drinks).  The portions are reasonable for the prices.  The special salmon sashimi  trio of the day was well prepared, and served on a nice plate. The Poke and the Chirashi both large  and diverse.  Can't say enough about this place.  Downside was that it was a bit loud, crowded at times and in one of the rooms the tables are set down almost knee level-almost like coffee table eating.~josef v~Seattle, Washington
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Sake flights (3) were interesting and the food was good (sushi, rice bowls). We had a short (20 min) wait and enjoyed our evening out after a long day at work. Not the quietest place, but lots of 'vibe' for those who appreciate that kind of atmosphere.~hanlievanwyk~Chicago, Illinois
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Service was fast and the food was excellent. Had a wonderful drink too but can't remember the name. A great place. I'd go back for sure. ~Chevy S~Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stop by Umi for the late night happy hour! Umi has a great selection of sake, sake cocktails and all other beer and wine cocktail creations. The happy hour menu consists of several discounted regular menu items from sashimi, sushi and other small plates. This was a great late night dinner option.~jgbeach47~Gloucester, Virginia
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was fantastic and we were seated promptly with our reservation but were asked to leave by a certain time, though our waitress did not come to our table for 15 minutes. Once she came and took our order we were rushed and my plate was taken prior to being done with my food. Do not eat here if you would like time to enjoy your dinner. If I am paying please give me time to enjoy the experience. We will not go back and did not order more food though we may have under different circumstances.~SarahCW~Cincinnati, OH
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The sushi here is fantastic. The menu is expansive, with lots of options and even some seasonal rolls. The staff is attentive and kind, and the environment is fun. I would recommend the sashimi!~sailorchica~Cincinnati, Ohio
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We felt like something light to eat and since Uni Sake House is a short walking distance to our hotel, we decided to check it out. We didn't book, had to wait for about 20 mins and we got a sushi bar table, able to watch the guys making the sushi.  The waitress was helpful and friendly, quite a noisy restaurant as everyone is enjoying themselves. Plentiful to order from the menu... loved the sashimi, had some rolls and tempura shrimps and vegetables, also fried calamari and prawns with a small salad. Modern Japanese food and there is also a Sake bar, have a drink while you wait for a table. ~brettnjess~Melbourne, Australia
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We really enjoyed the sushi. The wait staff was attentive even though the place was really busy. Each sushi roll came with 10-12 pieces. With just two of us we would have preferred smaller rolls (for a cheaper price) so that we could have tried more. We were so full after a couple that we couldn't try more of the ones we would have liked to. It might be better with 4 or 6 people so you can share around more things.~als03c~Abilene
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We thought we had good sushi in New York...and we do...but it doesn't come close to the delicious meal we had at Umi. We ordered one or two rolls at a time so we could really savor them, and did we ever! Each roll was unique and the flavor was incredible. The fish was incredibly fresh and flavorful and each bite left us wanting more. It was really crowded, even for a Tuesday night; thankfully we had reservations.~Y4269LF~New York
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here for dinner and stuffed our faces with sushi.  The menu is extensive and there are so many choices.  The rolls are huge and the seafood quality is superb.   The price is fair I would say for these huge rolls ($18-22 per roll).     Our server was nice but the place is very very loud on a sat night.  I know this is common in city restaurants but if I have to scream to speak with the person across the table then that is loud.  I would still be back though to try the other rolls.~AlexRobin~Chicago, Illinois
Umi Sake House~778411~Seattle~Washington~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Will return for sure.  The sushi was some of the best I have had.  Service was adequate. I did have to ask for our check twice but she was super busy. The restaurant is open so be prepared to talk loud because it is VERY loud.  Again the sushi is second to none.  Cheers!!~b40dash8~Spokane, Washington
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Always great to come here and get great coffee! Also a good meeting place with a fun vibe. This is a must do for locals & visitors alike.~jennk12312~Upstate, NY
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Bit of a challenge to get to the coffee shop but the coffee is quite good.  Big city prices (which I don't quite understand) and yet I tend to stop here every time I'm in Utica.~Sarah_W_1357~Boston, Massachusetts
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been here several times. The staff is always courteous and friendly. Pastries are good too. But it's the wonderful coffee that keeps me going back for more!!~Kabbyjo~Utica, New York
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I am not a coffee person & my friends wanted to go here.  They all had different specialty coffee drinks which they said were very good.  I had the best hot choc ever!!  We all had different baked goods which were very good.  Very friendly people who go out of their way to help u order the right thing.  Highly recommend.  One person said their plain decade was the best they ever had.  We,ll be back!!  I do not think ,other than bake goods they serve food.~Sandra Z~Utica
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I love this place! I feel like I'm in a different city. The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly. Those with me enjoyed their coffee. (I don't drink coffee.) The breakfast sandwiches were good. Scones are to die for!!~Linda S~Mid Florida, Florida
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was back in Utica visiting family and had heard about a couple new places downtown.  Great to see new business in Utica's downtown. My sister and I enjoyed a vanilla latte, an iced coffee, and a cranberry scone, all reasonably priced.  Coffee is very good as was the scone.  Service is friendly and the atmosphere is a lot like a Starbucks.  Looking forward to their expansion coming to Clinton soon.  The free wifi was great.~Zelco53~Fayetteville, Pennsylvania
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Nice ambience in this store and lots of products to take home and make a great cup of coffee. Blended cookies and cream latte was amazing.~SpicyBigMac~Spokane, Washington
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Of course the coffee is great, but also went for the Latte and Frappes and they rock!  Great service, cool employees and customers, neat old building and environment.~JohnS1026~Cold Brook, New York
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Small coffee roaster located in downtown Utica, NY.  Easy to get to and they have tables inside and out. The weather was beautiful so we had our roasted coffee outside. ~Roger A~Ocala, Florida
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Staying down the street at the Fairfield Inn where the coffee is basically brown water...walk a few blocks and you can enjoy great coffee. They have different roast each day. If you can't decide which to choose, they will let you sample. Busy place, which is always a good sign. ~rknobles~Rome, Georgia
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The location isn't the greatest, but it's worth going. If you haven't been yet, you should definitely stop in and get a cup of coffee. I've been several times and every time I've gone the place has been hopping. There are always people sitting and chatting or doing work on lap tops, it's a friendly environment.   You can also buy their coffee at some of the local grocery stores, if you can't get into the store.~Mccabers~Utica, New York
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~They roast their own coffee here and it is delicious.  They also carry goodies from Utica Bread which look and smell delicious. ( I can't eat them as I am gluten free)  I don't often buy coffee out, but the prices here are comparable to the chain fast food coffee shops and the coffee is far superior.  My favorite flavor is Cannoli.~kjgardeski~Clinton, New York
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This coffee shop is wonderful!!!  It has a very unique, homey feeling.  The proprietors, Heather and Frank clearly love what they are doing and are dedicated to their craft!  They are very hands-on and take the extra step to make everyone feel welcome.  The coffee was delicious and I love the big mugs.  They use real plates, etc. which gives it an even more comfortable flair.  It is a very busy place but yet everyone is made to feel special.  Overall, it feels like a second home! ~Kristin G~Richmond, Virginia
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped in prior to visiting the Tailor and the Cook restaurant.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The espresso beans were good.~syracusenewyork~Syracuse
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped while visiting in the area and loved the coffee, the industrial decor and friendly staff. There is another in the beautiful town of Clinton. I recommend you stop in and get a coffee of any kind.~CT-Foodie60~Orange, Connecticut
Utica Coffee Roasting Co.~2561284~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Work in that area and office goes their daily for a coffee run. Nice place and friendly staff.  Sometimes hard to find a parking spot but worth the effort.  ~Ann K~New Hartford, New York
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every course is amazingly executed, extremely tasty and well presented.  The place features a nice atmosphere and service is very good.  Definitely not one to miss.  It's not a 5 star to me just because portions could be more generous. ~Gianangel~London, United Kingdom
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can't say enough about this place.  The setting is wonderful; the servers are helpful, friendly, and attentive; and the food is exquisite (and even reasonably priced!). And just to be clear, I'm not a vegetarian, nor am I comparing this just to vegetarian restaurants. It's great compared to restaurants of any type.~crs107~Ann Arbor, Michigan
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I took my sister here for her birthday! She is a vegetarian, I am not. We both extremely enjoyed the food, delicious! They even put a candle in her dessert, wonderful surprise! Amazing waiter, food and service!~VincentH1982~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was craving cheesecake and decided to go online and search for "best cheesecake in Philly" Glad I chose this place off the list! I'm not vegan or vegetarian but this cheesecake was amazing! One of the best I've had! It's a must have dessert!~Lenny G~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Its nice to see vegan/vegetarian options going outside of just trying to replace/replicate standard meat dishes.  Like the small plate concept so you can try a variety of tastes.  Everything was very enjoyable with the meal, good service, but nothing was really excellent that makes me need to come back.  Worth a visit though.~Breezy-N-Wheezy~Glenside, Pennsylvania
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My wife and I struggled on our last Philadelphia visit to find high quality vegetarian or vegan dishes outside of Whole Foods Market. Vedge was recommended. The ambience and service were 5*. The dishes we chose looked like fish & 'pulled beef'. This was odd for my wife who has never eaten fish or meat (I eat fish & used to eat meat). Carrots that looked like salmon fillets! The room was full so we think our fellow diners enjoy this style of cooking. We did not.~Scottannan~London
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Okay, a group of us went to Vedge for dinner this week. We started at the bar for happy hour, and half our group showed up 3 minutes before happy hour ended. The bartender told us that he "didn't want to interrupt  our introductions by mentioning that happy hour was ending" so they missed the happy hour timeframe and drinks doubled in cost.   The table service was great, and our waitress was attentive and made some terrific suggestions. I'm not a vegan and have never eating at a vegan restaurant. Nor had anyone within our group. The food was good, not shockingly good compared to our normal diets. We all had some laughs about spending $100 per person and going out for pizza afterwards.   I'm glad we went, we had a great time, and all of the food was good. Amazing is a stretch, but maybe amazing for vegan food.  We would never go back.~MRCPRZ~Sewell, New Jersey, United States
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Our first time here for a special event dinner. My husband (carnivore) was amazed. after dessert he said he was ready to return anytime!  We each had a starter, main, and side. even though plates are a bit small, I was full. We tried fancy radishes, rutabaga fondue, spicy tofu, fried seitan, fingerlings and mushrooms. Loved it all. We even tried dessert. I had trio of sorbets (LOVED the cranberry and the pineapple) while my husband enjoyed Choc Uber Chunk. Great wine, beer and cocktail offerings. We left full and happy.  On a Thursday night the noise level was low (a few empty tables) and that made dinner conversation pleasant.~Moffett1~Key west
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Vedge is a stunner of a restaurant with imaginative plates, a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and a friendly and attentive staff. We will definitely be back next time we visit Philadelphia.~Ron T~Fredericksburg, Virginia
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Vedge is the best vegan restaurant my wife and I have ever been to (and we have been to a few).  The restaurant is very well reviewed and given that it is somewhat pricey, I recommend you read through multiple reviews before going.  Here are my suggestions: 1. Go lighter on the appetizers and side dishes, go heavy on the main dishes.  We were a party of four and we ordered three appetizers, all five main dish options (they come in small plates and sharing is a must), but only two side dishes -- we were glad we did;  2. Some of the appetizers are hard to share -- for example, the radishes selection: I would skip those; 3. Wine is quite expensive here and if you indulge, beware that your bill could get out of hand (which may be OK, depending on the occasion).  This being vegan fare, I recommend a light bodied wine like a Gamay (there are three different ones on the wine list, all somewhat reasonably priced) or even the Lambrusco if you like a little bubble in your red; 4. Don't rush!  Take your time to savor each bite and talk, share your experience.  And enjoy the impressive, top notch service,  You will be rewarded with a memorable experience.~Max59er~Palo Alto, California
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very good foods and service. We did take different foods and shared them so we could taste a lot of those.   My son would like to recommend Toffee cake with ice cream (or something that sort). i liked it too.~Hessu_FIN~Espoo, Finland
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We dined at Vedge Saturday evening (after having lunch at their sister restaurant V Street for lunch) I am vegetarian, not vegan, I say that because perhaps you are neither and are skeptical about vegan cuisine. This has to be amongst the finest meals I have eaten in my lifetime. Number 1 was always Chef Ludos way back in his L'Orangerie days in L.A. Back to Vedge. Food is clearly an art to Chef Landau and Chef Jacoby and what was created will stay in my food memories for a long time to come. We ordered multiple plates their Seitan reminded me of eating a succulent Filet. This isn't your supermarkets Seitan. The Rutabaga Fondue which is mentioned in many reviews earns its stellar reputation. The Portobello Carpaccio was cut paper thin by hand, delicately seasoned and served with a deviled radish. Their dessert options too are amazing vegan treats. I mean who can think that you can pair horseradish cream with celery sorbet to make an amazing treat that you'll beg for more of? Also a sage ice cream WOW!  I sincerely believe Vedge will go down in culinary history as creating a movement for fine Vegan dining and chefs taking seriously elevating Vegan cuisine as Chef Jacoby and Landau have. Let's not forget the service which was on par with the food. Stephen took care of us and was friendly, efficient, helpful and an amazing host to us while we dined. Really don't delay try out Vedge you will never forget it.~myl0ginname~New York City, New York
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We started with some spicy shishito peppers and curried cauliflower. The peppers had a kind of Chinese "salt and pepper" flavor that brought out a little bit of the mild flame and the cauliflower tasted wonderfully tangy. The best starter, though, was a peel-yourself bowl of lupini beans with roasted garlic.  We then had a rutabaga, trumpet mushroom and greens salad and a roasted beet pate. The pate tasted like it had crab salad in it (although it certainly did not) and was rich with a hint of sea foam. The salad was understated but satisfying and earthy, clearing the way for the main dishes.   The roasted mushroom entree redefined how I thought about mushrooms. The maitake mushroom was seared and spiced such that it had a remarkably meaty, savory flavor and not too spongy of a texture. It was like nothing else I've had. Amazing. And the celery root fritter that came with it was so rewarding I could have walked away happy with just that for dinner. My wife had the grilled tofu for dinner. It was a bit spicy and smoky. Very delicious but the mushroom just couldn't be beat.   The drinks we excellent with my wife ordering some specialty cocktails from Vedge's proprietary menu and I enjoyed two perfectly crafted dry martinis.   For dessert there was an earl gray ice cream which my wife still pines for to this day and a chocolate "uber chunk" that is a pretzel bowl containing chocolate ice cream laced with stout beer and topped with a custard. Out of this world. I also had a cappuccino which was very good.  Even if you're an omnivore I can't imagine your experience here being anything less than stellar. The service was impeccable and we felt welcome and well attended to. The noise level was a bit high and we could hear the conversation at the next table over pretty clearly (although it must be said they were loud). Do yourself a favor and get a reservation well in advance. We barely landed our table weeks ahead of our visit to Philadelphia. It's worth it: prices for this quality of food and service are remarkably affordable. Go to Vedge and enjoy.~JEGRH~Kerhonkson, New York
Vedge~2478284~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Yesterday I tried the Vedge. The ambient is very noisy and you have to shout to make you understanding. The personnel is smiling and professional even if young. Menu is not long but you will find very good dishes. The cocktails are very well made so take profit! I recommend this place.~270GianlucaP~Aix-les-Bains, France
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A quiet Tuesday? Hardly. The beautiful things were cocktailing downstairs at the bar. The four suits in the dining room were figuring out who's expense report was in play. Dates and groups of friends filled out the rest of the top floor. Our party of four included a three year old. If anything can go up on two wheels in a hurry, it's a dining room with multivarious guests at cross purposes.  if this is what a Tuesday looks like, I can only imagine what  weekends are like. But the staff at Vernick are pros. Our waiter Harhai was calm, knowledgeable, quick witted, and smooth. I believe he may now have moved on to chase his own new career, but everyone who approached the table was up to speed, and on board. The crowded and energetic room was never overbearing and had a distinct placidity to it. Quite a feat.   There's a fine line between delicious cocktails and overwrought, time consuming, and self indulgent drinks. Vernick is absolutely the former. This paves the way for a beauty of a wine list. Considering the restrictive and backward wine laws of Pennsylvania, the breadth and depth of the wines are a miracle. If I had one quibble, I would say that the Champagne selection was a little slim, but I definitely get the impression that Vernick is the sort of place that would find you a few stunning bubblies if you gave them a couple of days notice.  A child's custom made pasta was no problem, and had everybody at the table enjoyed it. The three adults shared a number of smaller plates of which the Grilled Romaine, Mackerel, Arctic Char, and Trout were the stars. Again, Vernick is on the correct side of the ingredients/flavor/plating visual line. The food is refined, balanced, and elegant with excellent textures without being fussy or precious.  The fish cuts, in particular, were of the highest order both in the starters and mains. We shared a halibut and also split a perfectly cooked squid ink pasta.  Portions were well sized, and splitting just one dessert had everybody reeling.  Bravo! Do what you can to try Vernick. Worth a detour.~angussmith~Boston, Massachusetts
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Amazing food in a pretty setting.  Everything we had was delicious.  For example I HATE peas. HATE them, however my husband loves them.  We had one of the toasts that featured peas and even I had to admit it was delicious. A must go for sure.~JessMacB~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dear Vernick, If only you used less salt,  Your food would taste better I wouldn't have to send back my mushroom and my potatoes The wonderful steak would be even better I would give you five stars~Bonniew19111~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Dinner at Vernick with friends turned out to be a pleasant experience. Although too crowded at this little spot, the service is above average, the food on point. Our table almost had every dish. The steak was a bit charred for my taste however it was quite good. The tartare a little small in portion but also on point. We enjoyed the pastas, the fish, after you pull back the charred skin is moist and flavorful. The egg and Uni very sexy. We overall enjoyed our experience... Probably one of our favorites in Philly.  ~phillyfood2~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great atmosphere and very professional staff and service. Their chicken is the most juiciest that I've ever had and their simply greens is delicious and very fresh!~MadeinNewY0rk~New York
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great evening, great food, great service. We had the good fortune of sitting at the Chef's table which is basically bar stools looking into the kitchen.  The chefs and waitress were all passionate about their jobs and very friendly as well.  I would definitely recommend Vernick. The special octopus was amazing as well as the oysters. Every dish had a great combination of simplicity with sophistication.~gbernstein~Orange County, CA
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I agree with anyone who has written that Vernick uses too much salt.  One of our party had to return a dish that was over salted (squid ink pasta), and one of the dishes probably should have been returned for the same reason.  The toasts were excellent: we had the tartare (very good) and the chanterelles and charred eggplant (fabulous).  The toast could have been slightly thinner, but it was beautifully grilled and the flavors blended beautifully.  The parmesan custard with carmelized baby artichokes sounded the most interesting on the menu but was in fact the least so: the baby artichokes were an unrecognizable mass of tiny fried shreds of oversaltedness that completely overpowered the parmesan.    The halibut was good but should have been better: the fish itself was tender and delicious, but the broth it was in was too salty and prevented the flavor of the fish from coming through fully.    The spaghetti with pesto and brussel sprouts was fine but not incredibly flavorful - although it might have been the case that since it was not too salty, it was overpowered by the other, much saltier dishes that we ate.    Wines by the glass were fine.  I would possibly return again but I would have to talk to them about the salt, and either choose dishes that could be prepared with less salt or choose dishes that called for less salt in the first place.  I have not encountered this problem at a high end restaurant before and I am slightly perplexed that they haven't addressed it.    Service was excellent: professional, friendly, unobtrusive and helpful.  The replaced dish came promptly and without question or hassle.~CAGreens~US
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I didn't think I would have the opportunity to dine here a second time, but I traveled to Philly for a football game and we got come back!  I love this place, everything about it is appealing to me.  I love the environment, the food, the service, just everything.  The variety of the menu is wonderful and the food preparation is interesting and so full of flavor.  We had a special of a sea bass type fish that I do not recall the name, as well as the chicken and a few sides.  Truly a memorable dining experience again!~Carrie S~Owatonna, Minnesota
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I just wish I could eat bread since everyone loves the "on toast" appetizers, especially the avocado and beef tartare.  Loved every seafood dish.  If the cauliflower is available, order it.  Bartender knows how to make delicious drinks.  You can sit in the backroom and watch the small kitchen staff flawlessly execute dish after dish or enjoy the tranquil upstairs or the higher energy bar area.  Go Go Go Go.~Jenna P~Pennsylvania
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I visited here last night with my wife and we had a really nice experience.  We were a bit confused by the menu at first but our server was very helpful and in the end we opted to share 1 item from the 'on toast', 1 from 'raw' and 4 small plates, although afterwards we felt 3 would have been plenty.  The food was very interesting, well presented and great tasting, although 2 of the dishes were a little salty for my taste. I think this was more to do with the ingredients (cheese) than over seasoning.  In all we had a wonderful time, great service and if we were ever in Philly again I'm sure we would come back.~Brian S~Burgess Hill, United Kingdom
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My friend and I have birthdays close together so while she was in town as we do every year we went out for dinner. Her choice was Vernick's. We were on the wait list for a reservation-the call came and we got a seat at the Chef's table.  How much fun was that-we sat at a table that overlooked the chef's making the meals. Rob and Ed were two of the best! They enjoyed answering our questions as we asked what they were making-Ed even gave us  sourdough bread toast for our sauce that was with our Halibut. We didn't even ask-he knew we would enjoy it! We had 3 small plates and one large and it was plenty for the 2 of us-beet salad was very good, pumpkin butter toast was even better and cold noodle salad-a little to spicy and the server removed from our bill and we didn't even ask! The large plate was Halibut and gnocchi the best ever! Desert was the highlight. I had a puff pastry with mascarpone filling and my friend had chocolate cake with ice cream both had a birthday candle and lots of love! I highly recommend visiting this restaurant-plan ahead for a Friday night- reservations are recommended and ask for the chefs table It's like dinner and a show! Thank you everyone at Vernick;s  we enjoyed your food and your professional and friendly staff~nancynurse73~phila
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~One of the best meals I had in Philly, the food was amazing and the service was great. Try the crab on toast, grilled lettuce salad, black ink pasta. Did not love the black cod. ~Rannoush26~Amman, Jordan
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place is really nice and refined. Food is extremely tasty and well presented.  Staff extremely friendly and professional.  Portions are quite small though, but quality is ensured. ~Gianangel~London, United Kingdom
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Vernick accepts reservations made on Open Table sixty days out.  We suggest you get out your calendar and select a date now!  We enjoyed an excellent meal in the downstairs dining area near the open kitchen. We could not resist the Maryland crab toast to begin our meal.  It was extremely fresh.  I sampled the small plate butternut squash pasta special.  It had fantastic tastes of sweet and savory and was also a nice portion for a smaller appetite.  My companion opted for the roasted lobster with green chili sausage and seasonal vegetables.  It was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.  The service was attentive and efficient.  ~Hollis P~Westampton, New Jersey
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We attempted to make reservations, but they were booked.  We were told to check in anyway and they may be able to accommodate us.  We scored a lovely table on the 2nd level overlooking the street.  We chose small plates and 1 large to share.  Everything was delicious:  lobster ceviche with ground cherries, beets with melon gazpacho, cold melon aperitif, fresh monk fish from North Carolina. ~55plustraveler2010~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a fantastic evening at Vernick. Loved the atmosphere, the service was attentive and friendly, and the food was amazing. We especially liked the red snapper in coconut sauce (special of the day), the mushroom salad, and the potato with smoked butter.~skigrrl~new york
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~When I told my friend in Philly last June that we were coming for a visit in September, she said - I'll book Vernicks for dinner right away.  Really?  Yes, and well worth it. The four of us shared everything we ordered, and it was all just fantastic.  Probably some of the most interesting and delicious food we've had in a very long time.  The menu changes often with the availability of locally sourced and seasonal ingredients.   The service was excellent : knowledgable, friendly, efficient.  The space is great as well, an old townhouse on several levels, with a great looking bar.  The only drawback for us was the noise level, which made it difficult to have a conversation.  But, we were all busy eating anyway.  I would definitely put this on a must do list when in Philadelphia, just make reservations way ahead of time.~DNWA~Port Angeles, Washington, United States
Vernick Food and Drink~3297221~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow. I've eaten a lot of good restaurants, but this meal might take the cake. The food here was incredible, and everything was delicious, unique, and inventive. We sat at the chef's counter which looks into the kitchen, and I highly recommend getting seated there if you get the chance. The food was all great except for the beef and squash lasagnette which had almost no meat, was burnt on the top and bottom, and was way too creamy. Overall, great meal and I would recommend things specifically but honestly the food was so good that anything you get will be incredible.~blas b~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A couple weeks ago I visited Philly and dined at the Victor Cafe. I have to say, it is now one of my all time favorites. The food is great and the servers sing opera arias in between providing excellent service~Carole B~Albuquerque
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A local client suggested this unique restaurant. The servers perform opear throughout the evening. The performances add a marvelous bit of entertainment with adequate time to talk between them.~mburrows~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~From the minute you walk in and see the red checkered tablecloth's to the minute you find yourself having tears from the beautiful sounds of the singers you will enjoy this magnificent Italian restaurant.  The food is excellent. We enjoyed all the appetizers between us, especially noting the clams casino's, and the butternut squash soup which is something I would not normally order but was delicious. I personally ordered the Saltanboca which was not too salty and absolutely perfect. Do yourself a favor and make sure to visit this restaurant.~palmspringsdoug~Palm Springs, CA
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had early dinner on a Sunday. Tried the smelts, mussels, a seafood special with risotto, kale side, linguini with clams and other dishes. Everything was fresh, some had a bit too much garlic for my taste but still very good. Desserts were very good. Loved the singing staff. If you enjoy opera and even if you have never listened to such music you will have a good time.  Many young people including some children all seemed to be mesmerized by the singing-except for one teenager who could not stop texting on her phone. People of all ages in very very close quarters. Looking forward to going back to try other dishes.~noconnection~Atlanta, Georgia
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have been here several times over the years since I moved from Philly in the 1980's. It was a favorite of my family then and it is now. Wonderful atmosphere, everybody sings, even the buspersons. Food great. It was our friend 40th anniversary and the upstairs bartender came down and sang "Some Enchanted Evening".~Navy49~Fair Lawn, New Jersey
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I prefer old school restaurants for their reliability and comfortable seating and lighting.  This place also has tons of old worldy charm, featuring head shots of famous singers and vaudeville performers, mostly of Italian extraction.  Service is always deferential and attentive, and many of the waiters are music school students or graduates who grace the entire cafe with a song from time to time (it is done with consideration - they do not get in your face and you can enjoy the music with everyone else in comfort).  The pasta dishes are all just excellent, and the quality of ingredients is high. This place is my two or three times per year pick-me-up place.  A different and charming dining experience.~Rachel R~Moscow
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~In Philadelphia, a city known for fantastic restaurants, Victor's Cafe is unique. Nestled on a side street in the old Italian neighborhood locality Philadelphia, the imposing entrances masks a unique dining experience.  The food is 5 star quality featuring seafood specialties and pasta entrees that are almost works of art.  The atmosphere is casual with checkered tablecloths and thousands of photos of opera stars adorning the walls.  The service is excellent but achieves a whole new level as periodically, each member of the waitstaff climbs a short stairway, rings a bell, and thrills the customers with truly great operatic songs.  It was a delightful evening that my wife and I plan to revisit again. ~Phillymark2011~Philadelphia, PA
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just had my first experience at Victor's cafe. Like going to Grandma's house. The charm of a early 20 century row house greats you as you enter and is even more evident in the second floor lounge. Just take the time to walk around and look at the artifacts and decorations!  Next, even though not my thing at all, you have the singing. This performers are super talented and it adds something you won't see anywhere else. If you are an opera buff, this may be you heaven. If you are like me, it was an experience I enjoyed, was in aw of the talent, but had no clue if they even got the words right :-)  As for the food, Awesome. Was with a large party and we sampled a number of the items. All started with soup, I have the vegetable. Was good but a little overloaded with chickpeas for my liking. The salads were generous and the Ceasar was very good. I had the Chicken Piccata, good size portion and fabulous. Others in party have the Salmon, Ravioli, Porkchop, etc. Everyone raved about the food.  The cannoli to wrap up the meal were scrumptious!  Overall, a really nice place with good food and a one of a kind atmosphere. I recommend everyone try it at least once.~Tim D~Feasterville, Pennsylvania
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My girlfriend and I ate here while on holiday in Philadelphia and it was one of the best , if not THE best Italian food I have ever eaten....The opera arias incorporated into your meal made it one of the most unique and magnificent dining experiences I have ever had. If you are familiar with the last two Rocky movies (Rocky Balboa and Creed) the scenes that were filmed at Adrians restaurant were actually filmed here....I highly recommend it to anyone who would enjoy a truly wonderful night out...ps....Don't forget to make a reservation !~Flyerguy_10~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My husband is a big boxing fan so while in Philadelphia we done the rocky tour which took us here during the day and we came back at night for a meal.  After sitting down we heard a girl introduce herself and telling us what she was going to be singing............I wasn't expecting it at all.  The meal wasn't great to be honest (I've had worse) but the atmosphere was great and my husband was in his element,~Samantha G~Glasgow, United Kingdom
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Not a lot to look at but its classic old world.  We started with salads which were good, not great.  The wine list was not spectacular, not real varied.  As we waited for our food, we were treated to the wait staff singing opera.  These performances happen every 15 minutes or so and are pretty terrific.  Main courses were very good.  I had pasta in a vodka sauce that was very good.  Others had gnocchi, tortellini and a veal dish...everyone was pleased.  For dessert a chocolate filled cake and a canoli were ordered...agaon everyone was pleased.  The price was fair, the service was good and the atmosphere was cool.  I'd go again.~PBC7~Dubuque, Iowa
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food was amazing as usual!  But the best part, bar none, is the entertainment.  We were seated, given menus and the bell rang.  We were there with a couple who hadn't been there before.  The aria was amazing, truly a talented artist.  The look of amazement on our friend's faces was priceless.  Then the young women who had sung came to our table for our drink order.  It's rare to see our friends speechless.  There were a few new twists this time.  The drinking song from La Traviata has a chorus.  The entire staff sang it!  I can't wait to return!~CS124578~Park City, Utah
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The place is small but we were comfortable with our party of 5.  Reservations were a must.  The food was just wonderful.  The entertainment really great.  We weren't sure if the kids would like the opera arias, but the first one sang was the one from Mr. Bean's Holiday, so that was just perfect.   Price was worth the quality.  The beer was warm.  Not sure what that was about.  The ladies all enjoyed the wine.  ~keith c~Charleston, South Carolina
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This Italian restaurant is full of happy energy - all the waiters are opera singers who take turns breaking into operatic song.  It is amazing.  You might be watching  singer across the restaurant or the waiter may be standing right next to you.  I've been all over the world and never been to a restaurant quite like this.  It was started in 1918 by Italian immigrants.  What a long history through so many phases.  The food is good if not superlative.  The overall experience is a 10!  For romance, for celebrations, birthdays ... just for fun.  If you are eating out in Philly surely this restaurant should be on your list.  ~JKLS333~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is 98 years old. You do not last this long if the food and service is not outstanding. This place did not disappoint. The wait staff not only takes care of your every need but are truly talented opera singers. Every twenty minutes or so they ring a bell set up the story about what they are going to sing about. Even though you cannot understand what they are saying unless you speak fluent Italian the performance is riveting. They food is very good and the atmosphere is electric.~jnezbo~Destin, Florida
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Victors was as entertaining as I remembered from my last trip to Philly 15 years ago. Remembered it so well went back this week and the singing and food were outstanding! It's an experience unique to Philly- we listened to six outstanding voices and the wait staff were attentive and super friendly~Pattiz2014~Camillus, New York
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~What a great way to celebrate your birthday!  The food is awesome and the singers are excellent!  Very romantic. The steaks are well cooked. ~lafnsing~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Victor Cafe~461518~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You know that scene in "Pretty Woman", when she goes to the opera, and can't help but tear up, b/c she's so moved by the experience? That's how I felt tonight at Victor's.  This was a homerun for so many reasons - 1.  The food is authentic and delicious!  2. The history.  This has been here 100 years, and used to be an RCA recording studio, so all over the walls, are the stars of the day that used to come here.  3.  Rocky.  This was Rocky's restaurant, "Adrian's" in one of the later Rocky movies, and there's a beautiful giant painting on the back wall that they got to keep from the movie.  4.  The opera.  I've never been to an opera before, but it was incredible to be eating this fine pasta, in such a historical place full of memories on the walls, and listening to the amazing voices as each of the wait staff, took turns belting out opera songs.  WOW!  It was moving and fun and unique, and we all loved it, even my kids who are 16 and 4!  We love good food, but the overall experience just put this over the top - highly recommend to all to try it - it's worth going out of the way for.~ificouldonlyfly~Yankton, South Dakota
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~After a day wandering around Santa Monica we walked past this restaurant which was buzzing even at 5pm. We decided to call in and had a 5 minute wait to get a table by the window. Nothing better than watching the world go by whilst eating your meal.  The food was amazing and fresh and was mainly fish / seafood, but does cater for people who like meat also.  The food is by American standards small - or by UK standards just right,  Will go back to this place when I am next in Santa Monica.  If you want a table after around 6pm you would be advised to book ahead as this place was heaving. ~Oliver S~Leicester, United Kingdom
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Ate at the bar and had appetizers.  The crab cakes and salad were fresh and flavorful!  The atmosphere was warm as were the staff. Good place for a nice dinner.~mthomas03~Boston, Massachusetts
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had lunch with son and daughter-in-law and what a beautiful place and views of the Pacific Ocean. Oysters were great, lobster rolls were excellent, only negative think was the kitchen burnt the octopus dish but was quickly taken care of and "Michael" was and excellent server with a lot of personality.~Larry W~Yorktown, Virginia
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I go there a lot! They have a huge selection of oysters, delicious fish and nice atmosphere. The view is great and they're pretty large so it's easy for small parties to get a last minute table or find some space at the bar. If you have a large party it might be better to make reservations.~Carol123321~Miami, Florida, United States
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I hadn't been to Water Grill in many years, but had enjoyed it in the past, so I looked forward to dinner there with a few business associates, and wasn't disappointed.  They have a wonderful raw bar, do a pretty good New England style clam chowder for a west coast place, and offer a Caesar salad with just the right anchovy influence without making it overwhelming. The main dishes, of course, are well prepared. My Chilean sea bass was scrumptious. I also saw elegantly prepared salmon and tuna delivered to our table.  The wine list was pretty extensive, including geographic diversity. In general, you'll pay about 2-3 times the cost per bottle compared to retail, which is a typical mark up for this type of restaurant. Service was professional, and our table had multiple folks coming to provide various services, in addition to our primary server.  I was happy to recommend this to a group looking for a business dinner later in the week after my visit.~Ron_in_paradise~Mattpoisett, MA
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I use trip advisor, and visit different place. And this my first report! If u want perfect fish, or shrimp, or doesn't matter seafood. It's really good place in LA! ~Isirk2016~Los Angeles, California
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Overall we thought this was a nice place, very crowed so I would recommend reservations. I had the cipiono and had some of the seafood been hot it would have been great. My colleague had the salmon which was very good. Overall a very nice seafood place in downtown LA.~VanHalenII~Michigan
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So close to where I live and feels so comfortable going in. Love the people and the food. Always a great experience!~Alexis_rae91~Los Angeles, California
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Water Grill Restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants...fantastic seafood(big variety), what can I say about the wine...Nectar and by the way Water Grill Restaurant serves Rombauer Chardonnay by the glass, while many restaurants do not. The service is perfect and fast as always! The whole family was satisfied while the prices were quite reasonable. It is a must especially for seafood lovers!!!~John R~Los Angeles, California
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The atmosphere is gorgeous. The music is jazzy and hip. The room is dark. Cocktails aplenty. The raw bar offers many spectacular options. The place was empty so our service was very attentive. He recommended a variety of oysters and when one came out undersized he brought me an extra - complementary.  I was disappointed that the gluten free options were very limited and not marked at all. Not really great for vegans or those not into raw seafood. The Mexican street corn was a disappointment given that it was like miniature corn dressed in a spice. Very small and hard to eat.  Go here for a romantic meal of oysters and cocktails. ~Live2traveldaworld~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The restaurant has a very strange, narrow and interesting entrance, but I am not the Fenshui master. So I will just talk about the food now: the choices of raw crudoes are great for fresh sea food fanatics. Everything was prepared either in the ice covered oyster bar or in the expansive open kitchen, which are very clean...there are around ten to twelve choices for the oysters and you do get to taste the freshest uni/sea urchin on earth--it's local and tastes much better than the authentic Japanese kind, by at least two levels! More importantly, the uni was prepared fresh from a live sea urchin, which goes very well with the wine I ordered, a 2014 duckhorn Sauvignon blanc...I strongly recommend the grilled octopus and the steamed king crab legs, which are succulent and fresh and sinfully juicy...the service was almost impeccable. And our server was very polite and knows his stuff...the manager was very pleasant and showed great hospitality... enough said, if you are in a mood for an unforgettable lunch to indulge yourself, this one would be a fantastic choice.~A M~Los Angeles, California
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant is rated #4 or 8,139 restaurants in L.A. by Tripadvisor? I've not visited the top three, but they must be something special to beat this place!! The venue is beautiful and ambiance is wonderful. You can see right into the large kitchen and it looks clean, well-lit and inviting. Executive Chef, Paolo Bendezu, is Peruvian and brings a South American panache to his dishes. GM, Brian Buonarti, has assembled a bar and wait staff of well trained, caring professional who guarantee your satisfaction, no matter what! I had lunch with a few old friends and started with fresh oysters on the half shell. They were clean, neat and tasty. At our table we had swordfish, Chilean sea bass, and spiny lobster. All good except for the swordfish that was over done, so they brought another sea bass dish instead. I enjoyed a Dover sole pan fried in butter and lemon. That was the special for the day, so extra fresh. Sides are extra. We had sauteed broccoli and fries. Also, tasty.  Good wine, Chalk Hill Chardonnay, and conversation filled out our luncheon menu and we lingered over espressos and cappuccinos for a long time before leaving. It was a very unhurried atmosphere...a real oasis from the normal lunch rush. Of course, it is not a cheap lunch, but well worth it when you  have time and good friends.~HappyTraveler0109~Pasadena, California
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came here for a casual business dinner with 4 women and loved it. Food was great, service was excellent, and atmosphere was fun and lively. Big tables, interesting menu and very well prepared seafood dishes with tons of variety.~Wendy L~new york, United States
Water Grill~364702~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had dinner there the first night in LA, and then returned with another couple the second night.  One of the broadest sea food menues I have seen in a quality resturant.  The fish is cooked for fish lovers, rather than for people who want fish so covered in sauces that you could be eating anything.  Good bread, a broad wine list, a great bar and excellent wait staff.~pageslady~Newton, Massachusetts
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Any time I am in town for business, I always try to stop here. The pizza is fresh, with inventive toppings. Sometimes it's super busy and hard to maneuver a place to sit, but crowds move pretty fast here. I love the white slice so much! Service is quick and friendly.  Highly recommend.~theladyknownascady~Tulsa, Oklahoma
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every time I visit DC and am near this part of town, I always stop to get a slice or two of NY style pizza, sold by the pie or the slice as you need. Fast, cheap and a little greasy - living in the midwest, it is everything I miss about pizza. ~Jennifer A~Terre Haute, Indiana, United States
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~First, location. If you're staying on the Hill, this is your pizza place. It's right off Pennsylvania and within walking distance from the Capitol.   Secondly, the crust. It's is doughy yet crisp at the same time. The bottom gets crunchy while the middle stays "pan style." There are about 20 kinds to pick from. It is $4/slice and the slices are huge! Two is dinner. Seating is outside or upstairs.   Loved it!~Roux-de-LA-vi~Bossier City, Louisiana
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I picked up their lunch special for $10, for 2 large slices of pizza and a soda. The pizza has great flavor and there are unique pizzas like a BBQ sauce pizza with onion rings on top. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is the bs environmental fee (1%) tacked onto your bill.~Jake W~Boise, Idaho, United States
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I really enjoyed it. Large variety of pizza and crispy. The handmade soda was good too. The special 2 slices and a soda at 10 $ worthy. ~Vanessa M~Cape Town Central, South Africa
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I was a little skeptical of this place because of all of the buzz - but it delivered.  I'd suggest sticking with the pizza as my chopped salad wasn't nearly as good as the pizza.  Good crust, good toppings, with some creative choices.  It can get a little crowded on the weekends, but it's worth the wait.~WFleet~Washington DC, District of Columbia
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~It was a good food, fair prices. The only thing I didn't like was we sit upstairs and when u need to refill you have to go down. Nice enviroment. The person serving the drinks was not that nice. ~1969ViajeroFrecuente~Kingsville, Texas
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Many different types of yummy pizzas to choose from.  You can order by the slice or get a whole pizza. They also have lots of different sodas available as well.~amalphiea~amalphiea
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The best pizza in DC!  Great pizza varieties, very reasonable prices, convenient location, incredible food - what more could anyone ask for in a pizza place?  Buy it by the slice or buy the whole pie.  Indoor and outdoor seating available. We The Pizza is the best and we can't wait to go back for more!~350brandyh~Knoxville, Tennessee
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The pizza was delivered pretty quickly to our hotel. We ordered a plain cheese pizza and it was decent, not anything I'd rave about. Maybe had we ordered something a little bit more than just plain cheese it would have been different but my kid doesn't like anything. I would order it again. ~CryRain~Louisville, Kentucky
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~There are many varieties of pizza offered at We the Pizza and there are always lots of people there.  There is seating outside and upstairs.  This is truly wonderful pizza.  The roasted pepper and sausage is my favorite but the Hawaiian and Pulled Pork ones are close.  ~Josie1952~Lexington, KY USA
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place puts a fun twist on all the history that D.C. holds. The pizza was delicious and the perfect warm meal for the chilly autumn night. Definitely a must for D.C. visitors!~Natalie A~Little Rock, Arkansas
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very much enjoyed our visit to We the Pizza. Our group of seven had no issue ordering or finding room to sit in the second floor. The pizza was delicious!~redpepperburns~Piqua, Ohio
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We came across this restaurant by chance and decided to try it. The pizza tasted so delicious. Friendly staff and quick service. We' d love to come back and spend more time here.  Highly recommend this restaurant!~Everilda S~Washington DC, District of Columbia
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We enjoyed the walk up Capitol Hill to get to We the Pizza, which we found to have delicious pizza and wings.  We ordered a large cheese for the family and my son enjoyed the chipotle bbq wings.......my kids are finicky when it comes to their pizza and they loved it.  While we did not indulge in the other flavors, there were lots of tempting choices in the window.  Laid back atmosphere and self service made for a quick and yummy dinner.~oceantraveler95~Raleigh, North Carolina
We the Pizza~2192447~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We walked over to the Eastern Market area in DC, after visiting the Supreme Court to have lunch at We the pizza, after hearing good things about it.  During lunch, they offer a deal with two huge pieces of pizza and a drink for $10.  And I mean the pieces of pizza are huge!  They also offer many already made and interesting types of pizzas from a Greek pizza to a spinach and artichoke version.    ~masscouple2016~Melrose, Massachusetts
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Can we just say what a fantastic experience we had at this restaurant!!  From friendly, helpful waiters and staff to the deliciousness of the food.  Attention to all details did not go unnoticed.  This was a great experience and well worth our time and money.  We will return again!~Vicki A~Brunswick, Md.
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great meal last week at this grill , we went early, around 6pm and booked our table online , I could see other guests waiting for tables . Very busy place , I ordered salmon , very nice .  Service was very good .  My only criticism would be because it's so busy it's noisy .  Will return when we're back in Phoenix. ~Hayleys68~chester
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Have gone here several times & ordered different items - all have been wonderful. Expect some waiting time at the peak dinner period. The wait staff is perfect. Given the upscale nature of this restaurant, it is surprising how loud it gets inside sometimes - you would expect better sound dampening so conversation would be easier.~1Kenneth1~Phoenix, Arizona
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Save room for the deserts-the bread pudding and banana cream were outstanding. The Maytag burge, Ahi tuna, and Jambalaya were delicious.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and available.  Highly recommend. ~cooleemee~Raleigh, North Carolina
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The baby back ribs are made in heaven. Falling off the bone wow! Artichoke appetizer was oh my god good. If you are going here you won't be disappoint.~JAMES D~EDMONTON
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The bar is so cool. And the service was spot on. The apps on the Happy hour menu, were all good we were a foursome. All had different foods. We all enjoyed our choices. The dishes were very ample, one could split the sliders. The wine was a good pour. And the reds and the whites were good. As was the "Cosmo"~45Kars~Apache Junction, Arizona
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is The Place! Want Burgers? Delicious Entree's? Decadent Desserts? All here, and all delish. The Hosts/Hostesses and servers were friendly and attentive to details. Everything: service, food, and ambiance was perfect. White Chocolate Grill has a casual adult malt-shop, busy vibe. We had a great time and will return.~larryh50~Texas
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This was our first visit to White Chocolate Grill. Loved the name and assumed that with a name like White Chocolate there would be dessert. I was totally surprised at how good the entree's were. Between the four of us we had the Fillet Mignon Cobb salad, the Tender Filet Steak Sandwich, and the Stacked Enchilada Casserole. Everyone was more than satisfied. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. The portions were perfectly sized which doesn't happen at a lot of restaurants these days (left-over salad isn't very appealing ). The desserts are advertised as being for two but we only got one for the four of us. We split the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.(Hint: the desserts are all "white chocolate something") The was a generous slice of mild cheesecake, a layer or white chocolate, whipped cream, drizzled with fresh raspberry sauce and caramel, and garnished with fresh raspberries. I still haven't figured out what the crust was made of but it was delish. Call ahead for reservations.~krlynn~tucson az
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Very Good Food here and a nice variety of entrees to chose from.  Menu is basically the same for lunch and dinner.  We eaten here a few times and no matter what entree we chose it is always very good.  Our server this time was Josh and like the others, he had a great sense of humor and was very efficient.~Larry W~Anthem, Arizona
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We decided to stop in for lunch because the location was close by. We were a little nervous when we arrived at 11:15am and there were only a couple of cars in the parking lot. We were seated and met our amazing waiter Clifford.  He proceeded to describe the unfamiliar offerings on the menu and offered some suggestions.  We really like this restaurant as we wanted something different. WCG delivers this.  In addition to the normal fare they had some interesting options.  I chose what I would call a French Dip sandwich but with turkey instead of beef and wild mushroom gravy instead of broth. The special side that day was spaghetti squash made with pistachios and roasted garlic.  My wife had a slaw/salad made with Brussel sprouts which she loved.   By 11:45 the restaurant was packed so we were glad we arrived early.  Even though they were very busy we never had to ask for soda refills and service was very attentive. Thank you Clifford and WCG!~taxdoctor~Denver, Colorado
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a busy day and were deciding on a nice spot for dinner.  My brother, sister-in-law, husband and I arrived at White Chocolate and were told we'd have a short wait.  They gave us a timer and sure enough, we had our table in 15 minutes.  The salmon, ribs, steaks were perfect.  The selection of sides was great and the drinks fabulous.~joybells99~Surrey BC Canada
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had amazing salads here. Very generous amounts too. Our guys had calamari, mussels, and prime rib. It was all really good. We all split an incredible white chocolate brownie with ice cream for dessert.~KBudz~MI
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had lunch on a Monday afternoon.  The restaurant was quite busy which usually means it is good.  They had a gluten free menu and I ordered the grilled salmon.  My HH had a club sandwich.  Our meal seemed to be taking a long time and then the manager came and told us that there had been a problem with my salmon.  They wipe the grill off before cooking the salmon for people with gluten allergies.  But they had to remake my salmon 3 times since the grill had not been wiped down on the first two tries.  I appreciate how conscientious they are about gluten allergies.  We got our meals but unfortunately my salmon had been rushed on the third try and was a bit uncooked.  The manager was so kind to remove our entrees from our bill due to the delay.  Worth trying again.~GFFoodWineLover~Thousand Oaks, California
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We have visited on several occasions and the food and service has always been very good. The menu is broad and varied and all of the food is excellent. The service is prompt and knowledgeable. They can help with your menu selections.   One suggestion for an appetizer is the grilled artichoke. Yummy ~Bob C~Phoenix, Arizona
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We often stop to have dinner here after a movies.  Food is consistently good and they are always busy.  Open Table gets you a table as soon as you walk in.  Go For the Tomato Gin and the Artichoke.  the WCG Salad, while too much, Is outstanding.~Donna B~Scottsdale, AZ
White Chocolate Grill~638881~Phoenix~Arizona~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Who wouldn't want to stop at a place called The White Chocolate Grill? This place has consistently good food, a nice atmosphere, and if you go in the winter they have fire pits outside and it's really nice to sit outside on the patio where the fire pit is, as long as it's not too cold. Food is good. Always. You won't go wrong if you eat at the White Chocolate Grill~Jama J~phoenix
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A little bit of a wait but well worth it. Great skillet options and the pancakes are fluffy, warm, and delicious.~travelinbroke~West Palm Beach, Florida
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~A near perfect experience. You will not leave hungry. Biggest pieces of Bacon I've ever seen. Service was old school......perfect. Went back World Series weekend....different result. Lesson learned....go early or you will lose time in waiting line. Other tip....don't go too early, we arrived at 6:20 am, don't open til 6:30, griddle not ready, food not as hot as previous 3 times. Basic two eggs, hash browns, toast and bacon...approx. $30 plus tip. Service was good once seated all days we went. ~GalapogasJim~Dallas, Texas
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Although there is usually a long wait, if you can be patient, it is worth it! Lots of interesting choices on the menu, food is great and service was outstanding too!~Dazeymae7~Colgate, Wisconsin
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Come hungry and leave happy.  Friendly, helpful staff, great service.   Have enjoyed both breakfast and lunch meals.~Chuckles78~Algonquin, Illinois
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Every time I'm in Chicago I make a point of having breakfast at Wildberry. Wether you choose an omelet, a skillet, pancakes, or one of the many other options, the food is awesome. Just make sure you plan on getting a workout in. Portions are large and you won't want to leave any behind. Be aware: wait times can be long well into the morning and even the afternoon. Arrive before 7 AM or call ahead to get on list.~sailfishshooter~Daytona Beach, Florida
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Friendly, clean and DELICIOUS!  Two big guys on business, looking for a filling breakfast.  WOW!  An Omelet and 2 Pancakes, Fresh Squeezed OJ and iced tea for my 6'3" 235 lb. business partner, Corned Beef Hash Skillet with 2 chocolate chip pancakes and lemonade for me 6'1" 300 lb, and couldn't finish it all.....big portions, great food, and we got out for $38. including tip.  That's terrific for downtown Chicago.  The only downer was the 45 minute wait at 9:30 am on a THURSDAY morning.  I can't imagine what the wait is on the weekend.~timpX8759ND~Annapolis, Maryland
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Had the chance for the first time to have breakfast at Wildberry Pancakes cafe. As per all  the Yelp reviewers, it is worth the try.  The breakfast was very good and the service was excellent. The portions are huge, and you have to wait. I used the Waitlist option on Yelp which was well worth it. ~Lovetravelall~Fairfax, Virginia
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been here twice and have had wonderful service and impeccable food each visit. I tell myself to try lunch, but I always order breakfast. The specialty pancakes are amazing, and the skillets are huge. I had the corned beef hash skillet my first visit, and I could not come close to finishing it. I had an omelette on my second visit and I did finish it, but only just. Waitstaff is efficient and friendly. You will wait for a table here, but it is worth it. This is a nice stop for breakfast before visiting the Art Institute.~cupcake_hull~Austin, Texas
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~If you are in the mood for a delicious breakfast, this is the place to go! Be sure to make a reservation or be ready to plan a wait into your morning. They use a cool app that lets you wander away but keeps your place in line and then notifies you by text when your table is ready. Just from walking around downtown, we didn't see a ton of breakfast spots, so this was on the top of our list. Delicious food that didn't feel too heavy. ~lscorp~Providence, Rhode Island
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~My hubby and I are breakfast folks especially on Saturday mornings. We decided that we wanted to go to a try a new breakfast spot. After doing a google search, I came upon this place. We chose Wildberrys. We got there around 9 so parking was easy to find. There were a lot of people waiting outside to be seated so I got nervous immediately knowing that we would also be waiting for a long time. Wrong! The wait was 30 minutes and it went by so quickly. Hubby and I went walking on Millenium Park to kill time and before we knew it, the restaurant sent us a text message that our table was ready. We were seated immediately and the waiter was quick to get our drink orders and also answer any of our questions on the menu. We ordered the passionfruit lemonade and it was bomb!  We ordered our meal and it arrived in no time. I ordered the Denver skillet with buttermilk pancakes without eggs and hubby ordered the Butcher's skillet with blueberry pancakes. It was delicious!!! After a couple of bites of my meal, I discovered that there was eggs in my food. I immediately told the waiter and she was very proactive in letting the manager and the cooks know. The manager ensured a new meal was prepared for me and he took my meal off the bill. He also came back multiple times to ensure that we were fine. I thought it was a very sincere gesture and it made a lasting impression on hubby and I.  The cleaning staff were amazing! They worked very hard to get tables cleaned and ready for the next group. We left feeling really good about the whole experience. We are definitely adding this place to our list of good eats. We also plan on coming back when our family are in town.~ChiTownLolly~Chicago, Illinois
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Straight in and seated for a late breakfast.  The staff were helpful and attentive.  The pancakes arrived within a reasonable time, and the cost was also reasonable.  I'm glad I took up the option of a 'short stack', as the meals were substantial.  The order was for "Signature Berry Bliss", and I was very happy with the selection, I will just have to go back and try some of the other options that looked tempting another day.~NMinperthWA~Perth, Australia
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food at Wildberry was delicious. Breakfast food never excites me, but this was just great. We had to wait 45 minutes to get a table, so get there early. The nice thing is, they alert you by text message when your table is ready, and provide an app you can download to monitor your place in line. So, while we waited 45 minutes, we didn't stand in line. My wife and I went for a casual stroll over to the Cloud Gate and through Millennium Park. We waited until we were about 10th in line, and headed back. It was a lovely wait. Once inside, I expected to wait a long time given the crowd, but our food was out to our table quickly, and the service was friendly. Definitely a good option for breakfast in a city that doesn't have a lot of reasonably-priced breakfast options.~Andrew F~Carmel, Indiana
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place is fast, portions are huge, and the food is outstanding.  Be very hungry when you come here.~BTLanders~Searcy, Arkansas
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We got there at 10 AM before going to the Art Institute and had to wait 45 minutes to get seated but it was a great place to eat.  Especially downtown.~Mike678901~Indianapolis, Indiana
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wildberry was recommended to us by the bellman at our hotel. It was excellent. Great menu and large servings. You definitely get your money's worth. Because it's such a popular choice the wait was over an hour long but you can seat yourself on the patio. It was on the cooler side the day we went so we were able to get a table right away and the server was there nearly immediately. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in downtown Chicago. ~AChristensenMN~Minneapolis, Minnesota
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wow! this place is fantastic, well worth the wait. Food is exceptionally well prepared. Service is great!~Thomas D~Cincinnati, Ohio
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~You need to use the nowait app on your phone in order to get in line and avoid the long waits, especially after 9 am. This place is so popular that the wait can be as long as 3 hours. I had the Napa Valley fig omelette along with a side of pumpkin pancake. I definitely purged during my first visit and it was worth it. Everything was done nicely and the portions are generous. I'd say skip lunch after a meal at Wildberry. The service was pretty good. Everyone was trying to get the food to the customers on time. Definitely recommended.~Alexis B~Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe~2407503~Chicago~Illinois~Certificate of Excellence 2016~lived up to expectations from all the reviews I read. everything was yummy. service was as good as the food!~888KJC888~Miami, Florida, United States
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Broad selection of delicious sausages at Wurstkuche.  The ordering process was straight forward and very efficient.  This was aided by the excellent staff, who were on hand in the line to answer questions and get you a beer while you waited on line.  Hooray for great service!  Really enjoyed having a selection of mustards at the table.~Mike M~Bar Harbor, Maine
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Delicious brats and killer fries!  I chose a traditional pork, but family members had chicken or  duck brats.  If you are truly brave, try the rabbit and rattlesnake brat.   Good selection of beer, but this is not a German themed eatery.  Seating is at long tables which gives it a friendly vibe.   We went at 2 pm on a Sunday, and high ceilings and loud music made the noise level almost unbearable.  Some outdoor seating, but it was 104 degrees outside, so we stayed indoors.  Located in the funky arts district, there are interesting businesses to explore.~junebugclaremont~Claremont, CA
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great sausages, tasty fries, and excellent beer. I go about once a month. Every time I take my friends there they love it. In fact one of them only wants to come there when visiting. Worth a trip to either Venice or DTLA locations. ~msmusicagent~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I went there last year. I heard it was good, from reliable sources. The sausage tasted fine, nothing out of this world. The problems were:  1. Sausage too small 2. Bun too large 3. Don't make people line up on the sidewalk. It looks like a soup kitchen. Do you folks really believe that by making people line up outside, others will think it's really popular and wonderful? Food trucks do this trick. Line up folks and WAIT.  4. The staff, especially the kid serving at the bar, had lots of attitude. I don't need that in DTLA, nor anywhere else. Once was enough for me.~notfromla~los angeles
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Just what you always wanted to try.. a rattlesnake rabbit sausage on a delicious roll. That's only the beginning of a menu full of insanely delicious sausages. Vegetarian sausages are also available for the non-rattlesnake crowd.    Wurstkuche has two locations - Downtown LA and Venice. Downtown hours are 11:00-1:30am and Venice 11:00/12:00-12:00am.  Beers, beers and more beers served in giant steins. Belgian, American, German draft beers and tons of bottled beers you don't recognize, but can't wait to taste. Beers are served in giant cold steins.  Not a beer drinker? Check out the non-alcoholic drink menu. Apple brews, teas, flavored sodas, colas and gassed Pellegrino make for delicious drinking.  My favorite menu item ...the double dipped fries and dipping sauce. Blue cheese and walnut bacon, Chipotle Ketchup, Curry Ketchup are just a few of the sauce choices.  Seating is tight, street parking is plentiful and there is always a fast moving line. Good prices and good food with friends or if in a rush. All hipsters, non-hipsters, Mom-hipsters, and all meat eating humans should not miss this place! ~Bunnie T~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Love this place - once I get inside.  The line is long and inability to make a res is a minus for me.  But I love the exotic sausages, duck fat fries, and excellent beer options.  Yes, there are hipsters, but not any worse than DTLA generally.  Ignore them and enjoy your meal!~kmfesq~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Terrific Sausages and Frites .  Lots of Varietes too from traditional to gourmet to exotic.  They also have a great assortment of Belgian Bier on tap.  I highly recommend this place.~KevinPH1~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is delicious here! I really wish the atmosphere was better. The ordering area is far too small, so the line often goes out the door. Seating is uncomfortable, awkward and in a very open room, so it gets extremely loud. On weekends, they also have a DJ playing, which makes it even more noisy.  That being said, this place is a must try! The exotic brats are unique and all are excellent. I'd highly recommend the Pheasant with Herbs de Provence with grilled onions and dijon mustard!~EmBentley~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is excellent. Haven't had a sausage I don't like here. The staff is friendly and kind to the kids. The tablecloths are brown paper and they give you crayons to color. A great atmosphere for parents and fun for the kids. ~theJohnson8~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is good, but the prices are outrageous and the atmosphere is rather plain for what you get.  Not worth the value!~dganas1~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This is about as authentic a beer garden as you are going to get in the USA.  Beer and sausages are excellent :-)~GreenPowerGuy~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place was recommended to me by a colleague and I was not disappointed.  There was a line already out the door at 5.45pm on a Saturday but it moved quite quickly and they handed out menus and took drink orders while you wait.   We got the duck and bacon sausage and the roasted pepper, both were great but the duck and bacon was the stand out.  You must get the fries also, they were delicious.~sandram972016~Irvine, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wurstkuche (meaning Sausage Kitchen) is located very close to the Little Tokyo Metro Station and can easily be walked to from there. They have a variety of sausages...some German, to choose from and it is a fun place to try. I've been there twice now and plan on going back again. There's plenty of indoor seating and a little area for outdoor seating as well. Oh...and they have good beers, too!~GermaicanSpiceGirl~Los Angeles, California
Wurstkuche~1380148~Los Angeles~California~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Wurstkuche is a very straightfoward eating experience.  Casual, public.  Wait in line (and hopefully it's not during a busy hour, because it can be a long line until you order).  Then take your number, and proceed to find a seat in the dining hall, with a bar full of craft beers on tap.    Perhaps one of the more affordable places to eat in Downtown LA.  Personally, I prefer the flavor of the cheaper spicy sausages, as opposed to the more exotic blends such as rabbit and rattlesnake meat.  For me, the fragrant musk of rabbit is a bit masked for me to care, especially when you get toppings such as sauteed onions.    The fries however, those wonderful Belgian frites. Those keep me coming back.  Fabulously crisp, but fluffy soft on the inside.  One of LA's best for thicker cut fries (chips if you're English). The dining, seating is mostly grab your own benches.  Unpretentious, and loud, with noise bouncing off the walls of the vast hall.  ~Chuck S~Los Angeles, California
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~A friend took me there, we are at the counter, the chef sent out some extra dishes to try, wonderful atmosphere and food, we all had a very special evening.~Robert S~Hilton Head, South Carolina
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Arrived around 5:25. Started with a few saltim (salad), and a great home made hummus and laffa (flat bread), then went on to some tayim (taste of) consisting of lamb kofte, and pastillas (chicken pastries). Kofte had a great texture. Went on to a nice dessert of konafi and a wonderful Turkish style coffee. Hummus and flatbread were what stood out for me. Honestly the best I've had out. The food, service, and company made this a great birthday meal.~Elliott B~New Jersey
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Evidently a big success.  Trendy, noisy, polished.  The food was pretty good, what there was of it.  I guess we misunderstood.  One "main" would be mainly for a person who had just eaten.  The serving of fish was a small patch, completely unadorned.  The serving of couscous was the size of one soup ladle.  Adding insult to injury, the tiny main was brought with a separate large empty plate.  I suppose the concept was "family style" - one should order double the mains as the number of diners.  Perhaps the server explained this, but was drowned out by the noise. ~BARRY T~Toronto
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~I didn't have a reservation, so I wanted for about 40 minutes for a seat at the very busy bar. The bartender was terrific...super friendly and and went over all the dishes with me. The food was spectacular, especially the humus and laffa bread, the beef & lamb kofta, and the fried cheese dish (can't remember the name). The fried cauliflower was good, but not great. The portions are small and fairly expensive, but worth the treat while on vacation.~VacationTraveller101~Los Angeles, California
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~I'll start by saying I don't like a lot of the foods and flavors on the menu no matter how they are prepared. That being said I did not enjoy my meal here at all. The staff was great and I'm sure the ingredients were fresh. A friend told me to try it even though I said I didn't enjoy that type of food. I'm always willing to try new things so wanted to write this review to help others. If you don't like hummus like I do not then you won't magically like it here. I have been to places where I like certain foods that I may not normally eat because the preparation is unique. Not the case here.~Ulikethat1~Philly
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~If you want to have a food tasting experience, Zahav is where it's at!  Israeli small dishes of all types for sharing exposes the diner to things they may have never tasted; unusual marinated veggies, raw lamb kibbe, chicken Bastilla, delicious hummus with hot, fresh pita type bread, wonderful grilled meats or vegetables, and the list goes on..The $45 per person menu is the way to go; you get so much food, even though portions are small, and it includes dessert, as well.  Noisy, yes, but an upbeat atmosphere with great service.  We loved it!~boncakes~Bethany Beach, Delaware
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Incredible food, inviting atmosphere, great service.  Every single bite and dish was phenomenal. Just be sure to make your reservation well in advance - even the bar fills up very early!~gw2588~gw2588
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~It can be a challenge to get a reservation here, probably because of all the deserved high praise. The tasting menu at $45 is almost a bargain, given the quality, originality--and quantity. Every dish pleased, although we each had our favorites. Excellent service that was attentive and never felt rushed. Would probably make Zahav the top recommendation for any moderately adventurous eater visiting Philadelphia. Do try the grilled duck hearts and the lamb tartar. ~prosecco050~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~My son arranged this for Mother's day.  He knew I loved to experiment with different cuisines and had been here and told me I would love it.  And, the boy was so right!  Loved the concept of the small dishes that met the needs of everyone there.  The food was delicious and the waiter was very attentive and understanding of ll the questions we asked.  I can't wait to go again.~Linda S~Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Plan ahead. A long time ahead. Reservations are hard to get. It's worth it. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Tomorrow!  When everyone at the table gets the tasting menu, you'll have plenty of food (and perhaps someone will be lucky to take some home). Your dinner starts with salatim (modern takes on traditional israeli salads), this if followed by hummus (our favorite was the Turkish butter and garlic --- beyond yum). Then are the small plates ... fried cauliflower, haloumi with sour cherries and pistachio, criminal mushrooms, spiced eggplant, and on and on.   The dishes come out as they are completed by the kitchen (similar to having tapas small plates). Our waitress helped pace the dishes so that we weren't overwhelmed all at once.  And for anyone with special dietary needs/concerns, the kitchen was able to accommodate and make changes.  Cannot wait to get back to Philly and Zahav.~eawnyc~New York
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Tapas style Mediterranean/ Israeli food that was unbelievably delicious! Our waiter James was super helpful and guided us toward amazing choices. It is a hot ticket and we tried two weeks in advance to get a reservation and the best we could get was 5:15pm which is on the early side for us! But we kept it and glad we did! ~Traveler123NJ~Boston, Massachusetts
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~The food is great, no doubt about it.  So why not 5 stars?  One primary reason, and one minor reason.  The primary reason is that the waiters really encourage you to get the Tayim (tasting menu), which is $45 per person.  That's not an outrageous price; but you get far, far too much food.  We had a group of four, including some big eaters, and we couldn't even come close to finishing the food.  You're far better off just ordering off the menu, so I wish the waiters didn't push the tasting menu, as it seems like a good idea but isn't.  The minor downside?  When it's crowded (which is always), it can be noisy and hard to hold a conversation.~crs107~Ann Arbor, Michigan
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~This restaurant is one of the best places in Philadelphia.   From the atmosphere,  service and food...it's outstanding.   We sat at the bar and Tori took great care of us.  Gabriel was excellent too.  We both tried the tasting menu which left us full and happy.  Will definitely be back. Keep up the extraordinary work!~BecLyn414~Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Unusual dining with all small plates or you can order a flight of small plates with a common theme. We had a fish flight. It was sea bass with risotto red fish with cheese grits and snapper with mango salsa and coconut rice. All wonderful. Large portions and 3 were too many for dinner. ~Claudia H~North Naples, Florida
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~Very nice and delicious food in The Society Hill Section.  Great mix of Mediterranean flavor.  Had lamb, chicken and vegetarian dishes, we all shared.  Had several shared appetizers as well but the names I cannot recall.  Flavors are delicious and portions are generous, would take clients back in a second.  Good service and nice atmosphere.  Prices are typical of a center city fine establishment but well worth it.~Bruce S~Lake Forest, California
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~We hadn't been to Zahav for over a year and made it a special event to celebrate our friend's 70th birthday. Reservations are hard to come by, we made these two months in advance for Friday night. We were having difficulty getting a Saturday night. We tried to get the lamb shoulder, which you used to have to order in advance, but they have no longer been taking advance orders and, much to our dismay, they sold out before we got there for our 7 PM dinner reservation. While disappointing, the remainder of the meal that we ordered was absolutely outstanding.  They had a limited ribeye Mesibah which all four of us got with the tasting menu.  That included the various salads and tahina  as well as sweet potatoes,  cauliflower, brussels sprouts, Naya,  eggplant and more. We got a very good wine for a reasonable price,  The Dom Guiton Cab $55.  The desert and assortment was outstanding and they were fully able to accommodate my dietary restrictions, no milk no cream no cheese! Ren Shaw, 9our server was 99% perfect.  We gave the night a very high 98%, only wishing we could have snared that lamb shoulder.  Next time!~David G~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Zahav~1070950~Philadelphia~Pennsylvania~Traveler's Choice~We have visited a few times now and it never disappoints.  I'm sure there are people that don't think they would be into Israeli/middle eastern food, but they really need to try Zahav before ruling it out.  From the humus onward everything is exceptional, and plenty of options if you are not a meat eater as well.~Breezy-N-Wheezy~Glenside, Pennsylvania
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Been there twice recently.  Similar experience both times.  Some dishes are unique, and better than you would find at other restaurants serving Greek or Turkish food.  But other dishes are pedestrian and frankly no better than your neighborhood place.  The setting is pretty and the servers are nice, but overwhelmed.  The food comes out way too fast because they are trying to turn over tables to accommodate the crowds.  You can eat very well here, but unfortunately it is not as good as its reputation. ~581RAS~Los Angeles, California
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Blend of Turkish ,Greek, Lebanese food which I don't normally eat. It was stupendously good! The chefs $55 menu gave us a taste of perhaps 18 different dishes. I kid you not this might very well have been the best meal I've ever had in a restaurant and I'm 63 and very greedy!  Can't begin to explain all the tastes. Just go!  Learned latter in an article on the plane flying home that Zaytinya is one of Michelle Obama's favourite restaurants. And goodness I can see why. Not a quiet place but busting with energy both staff and diners. Wonderful,wonderful wonderful!~john k~Rossendale, United Kingdom
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I can be a food snob. So I was somewhat reluctant to visit. The restaurant is clean, staff friendly, and the food amazing. I had the meze lamb kabob and tomato soup. Seasoned perfectly. Bustling, a bit noisy, but pleasant. I highly recommend. ~Drjdd~St. Michaels, Maryland
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have always been for dinner and this place is consistently delicious! There isn't one thing on the menu that isn't good. The ambiance and design of the space is beautiful; lots of windows to see the bustle of the city outside and crisp white details with soaring ceilings on the inside. The plentiful staff is attentive and do a great job of delivering and clearing the small plates. The cocktails are also very good. Highly recommend this for lovers of Greek food and those who have never had it before.~AlwaysOnNineOne~Northern Virginia, Virginia
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I have been going to Zaytinya for at least 10 years.  The first time I went for an office party and others ordered...the usual hummus, baba, etc.  It didn't seem worth the money for what I could easily purchase in the store.  I was convinced to go again a year or two later, and what a difference!  We actually ordered interesting and unusual tapas, and it was fantastic.  Hooked ever since and have brought many guests, who all agree that it is one of the best restaurants anywhere (most are very into food and travel domestically and internationally).   The food is great, with interesting Greek wines.  Even inspired me to take a cooking class on the Island of Kea with one of their consultants.  That was fabulous as well!  Highest rec...although worry that I'll never be able to get in now!  (one caution, can be a bit noisy depending on where you sit).~Travelmaven625~Washington DC, District of Columbia
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Perhaps it was the company for lunch that elevated the restaurant but actually I suspect it was the food, service and layout of the place. Again, a convenient location and caring service always helps. It is also just a pleasant place to spend a few hours and even though we had a very late lunch, we were treated with respect. That the place is large and airy helps give that open, Middle East feeling to the place. Like the best middle-eastern food what stands out is the quality of the ingredients and the skill with which they are presented and prepared. Again this is the type of restaurant where it pays to order small dishes and share. That way you get to enjoy more of what is offered. We had seafood and vegetable offerings and enjoyed each one. This was a last minute choice and it is always pleasant to have one's expectations more than met.~cfreedma~Sydney, Australia
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~So many people said we should eat here, that we felt we had to try it.  We made a last minute reservation on OpenTable and went early, about 5:30.  The place had not filled up yet.  We had a great server, who took the time to explain the menu and make sure we had covered all our bases in ordering.  Then slowly the plates started appearing, and appearing, and appearing! The fresh, hot pita bread was delightful and was kept refilled. The service was good, although the bussers are very anxious to take away plates and we were just thoroughly enjoying our evening and not in a hurry to finish. The dishes were varied and delicious - we saved room for dessert and had that also. One note, please do not miss the AMAZING and fragrant hot teas that they have to offer! Two of us ordered cocktails, which were very good.  My husband wasn't feeling well, and he ordered hot tea.  OMG, it was incredible.  He ordered the Jasmine tea, and they also had Marigold tea, and some other unique teas. I would not miss this restaurant.~Cruisers58~Bend, Oregon
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Stopped in with colleagues after a long day of meetings for lunch. We did not have to make any reservations but it was recommended. The restaurant was fairly packed inside and out. We wish there was room outside because it was a beautiful day to be outside. We all ordered a different shwarma lunch and they were all good. The dipping sauce that came with the fries was awesome! ~Trvlchic5~Poughkeepsie, New York
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This place had no missteps. We skipped lunch in order to enjoy an early dinner as we could not get a later reservation than 5:30. Everything we ordered was very good to excellent. Kale salad, sojouk flat bread, spanakopita, grilled octopus, haloumi, htipiti and the kebab plate. Good selection of Mediterranean wines. Minor quibbles as I would have preferred straight olive oil for dipping as opposed to mixed with balsamic vinegar and I do not see the point of mixing sweet with salty (as in dates and cheese). Service was also spotless and the piping hot pitta bread appreciated.~DoualaE~Pennsylvania
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We ate tapas type food at this mid-eastern restaurant. It is very busy and for good reason as the food is great, atypical and made in tapas type plates which allow you to try many dishes, and to eat lighter if not very hungry.  We ate on the patio which I suggest if you are adverse to the noise and bustle of the younger crowd. The hot pita bread was a useful way to dip into the various dishes. I will be back on my next visit to the Capital.~bartonbalis~Boulder, Colorado
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We had a wonderful meal here.  Love the room and love the small plates which my husband and I shared.  Our waiter Johnny was so helpful.  He was an A+ waiter.  We had 5 small plates which was more than enough food.  We had the mushroom pide, imam bayildi, garides me anitho, blue catfish skordalia, hunkar begendi and of course a wonderful dessert..turkish coffee chocolate cake.   Every bite was delicious.  We will be back~momofjake11~Virginia Beach, Virginia
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We really enjoyed Zaytinya.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun but as it got busier, the service became spotty.  It took us a long time to get our check at the end of our meal.  But other than that it was great!~Fozzley~Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We really enjoyed the food but having to continually ask for drinks and cutlery took away from a good evening.~MsVictoria~Essex, United Kingdom
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stumbled upon this great restaurant for lunch and we were very impressed.  Since there were 4 in our party, we tried the chef's lunch menu which comprised of 3 courses plus dessert.  It was awesome!  The lunch menu allows you to explore the menu without breaking the bank.  If you are in the area of the Spy Museum, don't miss it!~HoosierDady~North Central Indiana
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We're from Detroit area,  so we've had great middle eastern food.  This is some of the best I've ever had.    Somewhat off the main Chinatown area, but easy to get to.   Sit outside if there's a wait for inside.   Upscale, but not ridiculous. ~Soccerdad2~Michigan
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Went here with at the recommendation of a friend who lives in DC. The plates are smaller and reasonably priced so we ordered five or six different things and everything was tasty. They also have really good bread and I appreciated that they had some non-alcoholic beverage options in addition to beer/wine/drink list. We had the NA ginger beer and it was great. Good customer service also.~Lindsay N~Minneapolis
Zaytinya~481226~Washington DC~District of Columbia~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Zaytina provides amazing upscale middle eastern food.  It is clearly not a secret, since the place is busy late into the night.  Highly recommend a reservation.   Suggestion: Do not miss the Soujouk Pide.~Es_bo123~West Bloomfield, Michigan
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Don't let the outside or location fool you, this is a family owned and operated ethnic Lebanese restaurant.  It was FANTASTIC!!! The family is wonderful and EVERYTHING down to each ingredient on the salad is fresh.  Remember Turkish coffee is the size of espresso so if you're like me and don't have a reaction to the concentrated caffeine, opt for the pot!  Great size portions, reasonably priced, and a wonderful family to boot! Note: They DO take credit cards and I recommend using your GPS as some of the Utica street signs are missing!~nikcentralny~Sharon Springs, NY
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Everything I have ever ordered has been great and since the owners and their family are the staff, you always get exceptional service. Everybody goes above and beyond to make sure that you have a great experience and a great meal, the owner even brings around little cups of Turkish coffee, it is strong but free so I always have some.~Laurie E~Clark Mills, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Great place to eat!  Traditional, home-cooked Lebanese dishes.   Delicious and all homemade.  The restaurant is family oriented and the delicious Turkish coffee that Albert serves is on the house.   Love it there!~Mymy1018~Utica, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I always enjoy looking for new dining experiences when traveling. I was traveling across NY and decided to yelp local restaurants.  I am so pleased with my dining experience at Zeina's.  The food was amazing! The service prompt and the prices very reasonable. The cafe doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that steer you away. The food is excellent. It was a sweltering day and the air conditioner did its best to keep up.  I recommend the seasoned fries , yummy!~Chris B~Queensbury, New York, United States
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I am always looking for new dining experiences when traveling. We were staying locally and were looking for dinner. We had a great dining experience at Zeina's. The food was amazing! The service prompt and the prices very reasonable. The cafe doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't let that steer you away.~189chrisandbarb~Hillburn, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~I would not let my dog eat here without him worry about food  oiling place is dirty and just have bums in there asking for  money or cig stay as far away fro this place~Donna M~Utica, New York, United States
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Loaded fries and lamb gyro and saranac soda can't go wrong.  Filled both of us for lunch. It was busy but we were treated like the only customer with fantastic service.  Gotta try this if u have not yet done so!~JohnS1026~Cold Brook, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Meal was excellent and inexpensive very impressed with service and product.  Service was excellent and very clean.~Scoz117~Utica, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The Lebanese food was excellent - the hummus was truly marvelous.  I don't think the pita was homemade although it was good.  Service was good as well but the garlic paste was a not what I remembered from Brooklyn - a little too salty.  But overall the food was really good - a small neighborhood gem.~Julie B~Seneca, South Carolina
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~The food is amazing, the atmosphere is like being in someone's home - Albert & Laila make you feel like family even if it's your first time there. I make a point to stop whenever I am downtown, even if it's just to grab something to go. IN the years I've been going, I have never been disappointed.~moulterd~central new york
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside. Once you walk in, you are greeted by the owners and/or their children who also work there. You are treated like family!! The food is delicious each and every time!!~k13392~Utica, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~This unpretentious cafe serves authentic Middle Eastern (Lebanese) cuisine for lunch and dinner. Locals seem to gravitate to the few sidewalk tables. Inside, the cafe is tres casual, but clean, and when we visited, a steady background of late '50s to late '60s lounge singing/show tunes on the sound system.

Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We stopped here while at a baseball tournament in Utica.  The food was excellent and the portions sizeable.  The gyros are gigantic.  We had the sampler platter with hummus, cucumber dip, grape leaves and babaganoush.  All were delicious.  We also had the lamb platter which was very tender and a chicken gyro which was massive and delicious.  We had baklava for dessert which was also delicious.  Would definitely go again if in town.~Maureen M~Buffalo, NY
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~We were warmly welcomed when we arrived for lunch, were able to select our own table and service was prompt. We ordered a platter as our app, then two entrees. The platter we got, had a choice of four selections. Each app was wonderful; tasted fresh and flavorful. Then we got our entrees, both were delectable. In looking around the room, everyone loved their food and had been there before. As we left we were thanked for visiting their restaurant, the pleasure was all ours!~NanSim12043~Cobleskill
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Zeina's is family run and they provide a wonderful experience. The atmosphere is not elegant but that is part of the charm. The food is the best middle eastern food I have had. There are many items on the menu from which to choose and they will have special items from time to time that are always a treat.~mhodge5300~Utica, New York
Zeina's Cafe & Catering~4100651~Utica~New York~Certificate of Excellence 2016~Zeina's is run by some of the most sincere and loving people you'll ever meet. They care, they work hard, and they want you to love your experience.   LOCATION:  Located on Varick St., Utica's nightlife Mecca, Zeina's is easy to find and well-known by most in the area. As a result, expect to arrive with no issues but to, occasionally, wait a few minutes for service. It's worth it.   This restaurant is located in a converted old house. There's no hiding it when you enter and take your seat. The ambiance is a bit lacking due to this, but you quickly overlook any shortcomings when you meet the staff.   SERVICE: You'll feel like family because you will, literally, be surrounded by the Zeina family. These people are simply unable to treat anyone like a stranger. Prepare yourself to actually matter. And, don't hesitate to ask questions or to make your desires clear. They care.   THE FOOD: It's authentic, prompt, and good. They're not at all skimpy with the portions so be sure you're hungry.   There is nothing surprising on the menu, if you're familiar with Lebanese cuisine. And there are plenty of options. It's OK to mix and match items to suit your tastes; just ask.   Save some room, and some time, because they're going to push their Lebanese coffee and that wonderful baclava. Go for it!  Bring some friends, and make some new ones. Zeina's is great!~Rick S~Whitesboro, New York
