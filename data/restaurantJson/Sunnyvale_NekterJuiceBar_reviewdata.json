This place makes an amazing detox smoothie (I ordered the biggest size) and purchased a bottled juice to go (also a green juice). Cost me around $16 for 2 drinks. You can drink deliciously healthy but it'll definitely cost you so it's only something I get as a treat or while away on vacation and have no access to a blender. \nHowever, I really enjoyed the juice and the friendly staff and will continue to go in the future. Parking in this lot is atrocious by the way. Expect a 10 minute delay in finding parking anywhere around 11am to 2pm.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-20T16:28:16-0400", "location_id": "10622687", "id": "394892485", "user": {"username": "Frumpy L", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
