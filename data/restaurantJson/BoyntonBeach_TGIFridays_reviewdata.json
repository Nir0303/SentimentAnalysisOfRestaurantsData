Maybe 3 tables in the restuarant. Had a veteran server, this we knew because the couple we joined for lunch eats here religiously. Drinks 20 minutes food another 30 minutes. The potato skins still frozen with frozen cheese on top. I don't know how you can possibly mess something up that only needs to be heated up with a lot of time to do it. General manager cane out to the table and pretty much laughed in our faces. He claims he was the one cooking in the kitchen. Ok now it all makes sense. Most of the food that was ordered was sent back because it was either frozen or not what we had ordered. It would have been nice if between the server or the manager things got corrected but never hapoened. This restuarant is in a prime location and would probably be a lot busier but it will never happen with people running it that just don't care.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-09-07T14:49:35-0400", "location_id": "403979", "id": "227571859", "user": {"username": "Kylie8069", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
