The garlic rolls I will refuse to eat because they are drained in oil and there gross. The meatball sub in many occasions had egg shells on them. The plaza that this place is located in is not in the best neighborhood and so If I have nothing else to eat since they are close to work I come here but it's definitely not my first option. The daily lunch special is not that bad of a price I just wish they would get a new cook to make better garlic rolls!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-18T06:52:04-0400", "location_id": "474189", "id": "383677033", "user": {"username": "Liz A", "user_location": {"name": "Hollywood, Florida", "id": "34296"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34565-d474189-r215796498-m11068-Zuccarelli_Pizza-Plantation_Broward_County_Florida.html#review215796498", "text": "The best New York style pizza I've had in a long time!
