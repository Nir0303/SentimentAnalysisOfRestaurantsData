Get there early and you'll find them, but later in the afternoon and you won't.  Cash only, so be aware.  I haven't had donuts that satisfy my craving in decades, since I worked late shift at Kmart in Oxnard.  These do it, but with a little less variety and nothing late, sadly.\nI love their sandwich croissants with ham, but they tend towards limp, but not enough to stop me from getting them.   I'm not sure if they're even open in the later afternoon/evenings at all, so the early bird and all that.\nTheir staff are friendly, but not perky, but you'll like them all the same.\nParking - It's a bit tight, so enter at either opening, but be careful on your way out due to traffic.  Be aware that people tend to slew around the corner very fast on the Lewis Road side, but charge for the corner on the Ventura Blvd side.  I do not recommend charging across Lewis Road towards the Metrolink Parking lot in order to travel North, back into town under the freeway - dangerous at best.  Leave via the Ventura Blvd. side and try to get into the turn lane, and definitely do not try to cross the lanes in an attempt to go West.  \nIf you get stuck, drive Lewis to the next stop light at Dawson Place and go right or left  and make a turn-about there.  I suggest the Left into the Crush Winery parking lot, it'll be easier and safer than any other, or you wind up driving in circles.\nWheelchairs - You can wheel your way to the front door at the parking lot corner, which is also the best place to park, near the corner mexican food place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-12T16:35:25-0500", "location_id": "2402632", "id": "339516066", "user": {"username": "Tvlr8", "user_location": {"name": "Camarillo, California", "id": "32147"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Storage Wars", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32147-d2402632-r213224415-m11068-Donut_Queen-Camarillo_California.html#review213224415", "text": "nice clean little doughnut shop.... good service for a Sunday morning enjoyed our fresh doughnuts along with Starbucks coffee.... i liked the light weight pastry and cinnamon roll", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-01T21:54:21-0400", "location_id": "2402632", "id": "213224415", "user": {"username": "Debbie R", "user_location": {"name": "Murrieta, California", "id": "32764"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Nice Little Find", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32147-d2402632-r206032965-m11068-Donut_Queen-Camarillo_California.html#review206032965", "text": "I usually get up early when we travel to go photograph the surrounding area.
