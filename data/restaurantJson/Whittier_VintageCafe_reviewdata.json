My MIL is not a gourmet by any standard, but my wife and I enjoy fine dining.  We found Vintage online and after reading a few reviews, decided to go there.  Vintage is a long narrow restaurant, in uptown Whittier.  It is warm and charming, and would be great for a romantic meal - with one exception.  There is a TV over the bar, and it's visible from much of the restaurant.  It just seems a little out of place.\n\nMy MIL ordered the salmon with no appetizer and a glass of water, my wife ordered French onion soup, coq au vin and a glass of red wine, and I, a Caesar salad, wild mushroom ravioli and a pint of IPA.  \n\nMy wife's soup was dark and rich in flavor.  The broth looked to be beef based, rather than chicken, and while it was very good, a splash of sherry would have taken it to another level.  \n\nI am pretty fussy about Caesar salads, and often order them to form a first opinion of a restaurant.  There are far too many restaurants which add non-traditional ingredients to their Caesar, leave a few out, or serve woefully inedible dressing with it.  Fortunately, Vintage's Caesar was excellent, and very traditional.  Their dressing was outstanding, and far better than any other I've had this year.\n\nOur entress arrived, and my MIL seemed to enjoy her salmon very much.  The portion was the perfect size, and the veggies that it came with were perfectly cooked.  My wife's coq au van was served more deconstructed than traditional, yet it quite good and she really enjoyed it.  My ravioli were simply fantastic!  A good sized portion of ravioli in a lush sauce that was simply outstanding. \n\nAs far as beverages, my wife's wine was perfectly good, but my IPA was just so-so.  There is no shortage of excellent brewers in southern California, so I think it's reasonable to expect great beer in an upscale restaurant.\n\nWe all shared two desserts - creme brulee and an apple tart.  Both were excellent, and the apple tart was exceptional.\n\nTo say we enjoyed this meal would be an understatement.  Most everything, except my beer, was very good to excellent.  \n\nWhile I am not from Orange County, and have not dined at every restaurant in the area, I would certainly recommend Vintage Cafe to anyone looking for an outstanding meal.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-08-18T11:13:43-0400", "location_id": "1976476", "id": "172847014", "user": {"username": "rodenbach", "user_location": {"name": "Tucson", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2013-02", "title": "not a french restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33268-d1976476-r153482157-m11068-Vintage_Cafe-Whittier_California.html#review153482157", "text": "Went there last night.
