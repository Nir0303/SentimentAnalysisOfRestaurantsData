I have been going to this little sandwich shop for over 25 years and I swear the sandwiches have only gotten better!! My favorite is The Rachel, which is the most delicious pastrami, piled sky high on the best rye bread!! I honestly can only eat half at a sitting, it's so big. And their pickles are out of this world, and you can buy extra to take home!! I stop in anytime I am on east Hillsboro Blvd. People are nice, food is excellent, whats not to love?
