The hotel is solid. Modern Courtyard appointments, pretty clean.  Nice front desk staff.  No Bistro in this one, however,  There is a place to dine in the building (Nage) which is pretty good and has a small bar.  The location is fine. A bit of a walk to the Metro, but not too far.\n\nIt has a fitness facility but it is SMALL. Very little if you want to lift weight- just dumbbells and a bench, nothing more.\n\nMy issue with this stay was with the HVAC.  It was a very chilly Fall evening with temperatures down into the 30s and, well, I didn't have any heat. None. It was cold.  I didn't get more than a couple of hours of sleep due to my only finding this out in the middle of the night when the temp in the room had dipped into the low 60s.   The staff apologized and the issue was fixed the next day however, nobody offered to do anything other than fix the heat.  I'm a road-warrior and go with the flow but when you pay for a place to sleep and you don't sleep, well, call me crazy, but maybe the hotel should do something for you.  Again, I go with the flow and let it go.  Now the thing that really turned me off... after I checked out, I let the hotel management know about my experience via an e mail. More of a constructive, sharing my experience, e mail, nothing in there that indicated I was mad, just a, \"hey, you should know about this\" kind of note.   No response.  Nothing.
