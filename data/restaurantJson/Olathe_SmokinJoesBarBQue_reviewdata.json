I ordered the burnt end dinner and a brownie togo. I had never ate Smokin joe's before and drove past all the time. I was really craving some good saucy BBQ like you get at Joes KC and Gates. The sauce smelled spicy so having the brownie to balance my meal with some sweetness was a good decision....right? I was so wrong. The only item recommended to me was the slaw and it was had good flavor but was a little thin/runny.  I could have probably slapped some of the slaw and beans on a thicker piece of bread and had a more satisfying dinner. Meat was dry, like chunks of beef you left in a pan overnight and then served someone as is. \n\nSo after being deflated with my BBQ experience I thought, well at least I have a \"gooey\" brownie. I poured a tall glass of milk and plated my dessert. There was not a gooey brownie in that box. It was the sole of a shoe. It even tasted/smelled like leather. I love to bake and was trying to think what would make a brownie smell like that. Were they baked in a rusty pan? Thinking about it made it worse. I was so disgusted and disappointed. It is too bad that a little hole in the wall place like that can't get BBQ right. Those are usually the hidden gems.

It is a nice quaint little restaurant where you can smell the aroma of burning wood the second you get out of your car, and even more when you go in the front door. Like so many of the BBQ places in KC, you order at the front counter then they bring the food to your table.

As you noticed, you are able to order a single rib here, which I really like. Sometimes I want something else for my main course, but also need a rib on the side. The ribs were cooked a little more than my liking, but they were still very solid ribs. They were not bite off the bone, they were fall off the bone, but maybe just a little past the point of being moist fall off the bone. Most prefer fall off the bone, and if you do, you will really like these ribs. The burnt ends were cooked very nicely, with a little char on the outside. They were very good. If I had to find a complaint it would be that I prefer the brisket point be used for the burnt ends, and these were a leaner cut of meat, making them a little less tender and more dry, but also removing the big chunks of fat you find in burnt ends made from the point. Overall, very solid burnt ends. The beans were also very solid, with a little spice to them. I also tried some of their hot bbq sauce, which I really liked and it was pretty spicy for bbq sauce.\n\nOverall this was a solid place to get some KC BBQ.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-17T15:20:29-0400", "location_id": "846875", "id": "383539366", "user": {"username": "joshua b", "user_location": {"name": "Olathe, Kansas", "id": "38954"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Still the best!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38954-d846875-r380910057-m11068-Smokin_Joe_s_Bar_B_Que-Olathe_Kansas.html#review380910057", "text": "I had to go back and it was so good I made sure I introduced some pals from North Kansas City to this gem!

The meat overall has been good, and the french fries are supersized.  They serve a secret family recipe for their Cole Slaw, your party will either love it, or hate it, I LOVE it, my husband hates it <---they say opposites attract :) The baked beans are really good, too.

If you're driving through downtown Olathe, it can be missed if you blink.\n\nFor years before a couple of larger BBQ joints moved to town, this was the \"go-to\" place. In my opinion, I am still a fan!\n\nThis place has a few tables and a little seating at the bar area where you place and pick-up your orders but they also do a heck of a take-out business. \n*Fast & reliable service.\n*Good quality food.\n*Large portions.\n*Prices are reasonable for BBQ.\n\nEach day of the week they offer a different special that is discounted a bit from regular menu prices.\n\nCurrently, Wed & Sun are slab days. I won't quote prices since those are subject to change.\n\nI have introduced many to this hidden gem. I highly recommend the slaw even to those who are not a fan and most have truly enjoyed it. Creamy with a hint of garlic, it is a great accompaniment to the tad of spice in their BBQ sauce.\n\nMost everything comes with the wonderful, crinkle cut fries. \nHonestly, I think I have tried everything on the menu at one time or another and not been disappointed.\n\nHands down though....even if you're not feeling like you want to order one of their various meat options...grab a slaw, baked bean and fry. Dip those delicious sticks of golden goodness into the goo of the beans & slaw and enjoy! I know it sounds odd but it is so good!\n\nNext time you pass by, give them a try.
