You will always find your favorite menu items anywhere you find a Waffle House.  Over the years, of course, there have been some minor changes, like no longer having pork chops with eggs on the menu, but by and large, consistency is just that.  Two of us decided on the steak and eggs, one with tomato slices and the other with hash brown potatoes.  The steaks were, naturally, thin and nicely done in the manner we requested.  The tomato slices were as good as you can obtain here in the winter months...good, but not vine ripened.  Our son opted for bacon, which was cooked crisp without burning.  I asked for well done hash browns, and got just that...done exactly as I like them. If you are not familiar with Waffle House, one of their specials is hashbrowns done with a variety of toppings.  Had I not been dieting, that would have been my joy of the day!  Linda, our server was very attentive without being overbearing.
