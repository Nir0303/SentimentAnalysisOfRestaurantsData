The young waitresses are more interested in flirting with the young guys sitting at the bar than to take care of an older couple.  We had such waitress once.  We sat down at a high-top table and my husband put down a $20 bill.  A waitress finally came to our table and we ordered a pizza.  She took the $20 bill and left.  Neither one of us noticed that she had taken it, so when the pizza arrived, and she told us the price in order to collect, we both thought that the other took the money off the table.  I then gave her another $20 bill.  Much later we realized that that we had paid twice for the pizza.  The entire time the waitress did not return to our table, she was much too busy flirting with a group of guys at the bar.  My husband had to get up and get us another beer at the bar himself.  Since we had already given a $20 tip for inferior service, we left without leaving an additional tip.  We never again went there.

After ordering (sara) our waitress tells us our total is $16 and before getting our food n drinks we had to pay wich i found very unorthodox but paid. Sara never produced a bill for us.  When i asked can i see a copy of the bill she lied and said she can't she closed out the check. I have served fr 5+ years and i know for a fact she was lieing. Sara gave us our food never came back to check on us or anything. It wasn't that crowded i dont know why she wasn't very attentive at all. Before leaving i asked the bartender for a copy of our bill after waiting 5 min. Finnaly got our bill and of course was over charged because sara made up a price in her head and tried to be slick! The bartender refunded me our money and we left. Nevertheless i will NEVER return to this establishment. I only gave one star because dispite our horrible service and or con of a waitress sara the wings were good.
