Then after he finished and we returned from working at the Balloon Fiesta the water in the sink in the kitchenette would not come on. I tried to turn it on below the sink but it was leaking. The plumber came back on Sunday to fix this issue. Another no nap day. The rest of the week was the normal - not enough towels/ toilet paper and such. but to end up the week we had the AC blowing while we were at the Fiesta and when we returned the room was hotter then it was outside. I called the front desk and was told that \"they\" turned on the heaters because of the \"freeze warning\". All we could do was open the doors and get a fan from maintenance to circulate the air. Other then that the beds were nice and comfy and the room is very large. But I don't plan to stay there again. Especially if they close off all the outside doors.
