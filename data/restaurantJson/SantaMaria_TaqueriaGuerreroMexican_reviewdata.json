Anyway, my friend and I ordered the Caldo de Res and another friend ordered the omelet with ham, chorizo, and cheese.  This came with beans and rice, so the plate was full and she could eat only half.  There's a \"cart\" with condiments of salsa, onions, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, etc.  The salsa (which you go up to get) was very good with the chips.  The caldo had potatoes, carrots, beef, and I think maybe some chayote.  The fixings - cilantro, onion, and lime were brought to us.  We were there around 9:00 a.m., and given another hour, I think the beef would have been very tender.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-07T09:53:40-0500", "location_id": "5052865", "id": "345640709", "user": {"username": "Anne N", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
