Best Western was nothing compared to this Inn. Great beds great service and most importantly great WI FI.FREE. I will definitely stop here again.  I encourage everyone to give them a try.

The rooms could be nice but the carpets are filthy apparently due to the dirt and grime from the construction worker\u2019s boots and the beds are way past their use by date.
