With it's roots as a German butcher shop, Lutz's makes many of its own pork and beef based cold cuts and meat products on premises.  The result is unmatched freshness and superior taste.  With a nice variety of fresh specialty rolls and breads always on hand, Lutz's is our \"go to\" place for the very best sandwiches in town.  There's no seating at Lutz's - it's all take out.  \n\nOf course, as an \"all around\" butcher shop, we feel that Lutz's can't be beat!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-06-30T03:53:02-0400", "location_id": "4411053", "id": "165740565", "user": {"username": "RobDeb2006", "user_location": {"name": "Union, New Jersey", "id": "46878"}}}]}
