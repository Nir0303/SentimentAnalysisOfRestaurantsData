I usually get the two dish combo plate that comes with chow mein or rice. My favorite two dishes to order are orange chicken and walnut prawns. This time I opted however for orange chicken and  kung pao chicken.   Portions are good size and sometimes I even ask them to put in less chow mein just because  they give you so much for a reasonable price..\n\nIt can be busy as its a popular Panda Express to stop at during lunch hour or after work when one does not want to cook.  Staff is friendly and works hard to deliver food and service as quickly as possible.  The chefs in the place always seems to be cooking during the busy times to replace things as they run low; as such in general food is relatively freshly cooked.\n\nThere are sides such as egg rolls, etc.\n\nOrders are served with fortune cookie - i.e. the two dish plate will have one fortune cookie with it.\n\nParking is by the restaurant and is free. Often people take the food for take out but they do have both inside and outside patio seating as well.\n\nThere are other ordering options such as family style or small bowl style if one wants a bit less.\n\nMy personal four star rating is given since it is a reasonably good price at a good price for a quick meal.  Is is the best Asian food in the area - no, but for a fast food place, its a good place to go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-12-05T11:06:34-0500", "location_id": "4251079", "id": "243108899", "user": {"username": "mini", "user_location": {"name": "Fremont, California", "id": "32411"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "selfish portions", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32717-d4251079-r186578068-m11068-Panda_Express-Milpitas_California.html#review186578068", "text": "Hey not sure what is going on here but really??
