The boring name is a good fit for this little Chinese place. We decided the food was \"okay,\" a slim notch above \"not bad.\" Looking for positive things to say we found that it is convenient for the Law School corner of campus and the prices are good. I love pot stickers. Theirs were wondrously boring. The fried tofu was bland even with sauce. But you can try a small range of their food at the lunch buffet.\n\nThis is NOT a place to take a first date if you want a second date. There is absolutely nothing fancy or attractive here. On the other hand, when you have been dating for a year and want to eat together without impressing or busting the wallet, this may be a decent choice. But with so much to choose from in the area I would only return for variety.\n\nPerhaps if I loved bubbles in my tea I would have become a fan.
