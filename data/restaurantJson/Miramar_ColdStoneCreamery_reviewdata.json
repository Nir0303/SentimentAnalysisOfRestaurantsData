The flavors are delicious, but my favorite has to be strawberry.  The shakes are also delicious...yesterday I tried the strawberry blonde, but I changed a couple things......instead of caramel I asked for chocolate sauce, and instead of the canned strawberries, I asked for chocolate shavings.  It was very good.  \n\nI only have two negatives.  First, the strawberries used by cold stone are the canned kind.  It would be much better if they used fresh fruit!!!  In my opinion, fresh is much better than canned!!!!  Other than that, it's always a nice experience at cold stone.  And second, the prices are a little steep.  Cold stone could probably reduce their prices by 15 percent and still make a good profit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-11T14:35:03-0500", "location_id": "10058101", "id": "354665907", "user": {"username": "Johnny G", "user_location": {"name": "Pembroke Pines, Florida", "id": "34548"}}}]}
