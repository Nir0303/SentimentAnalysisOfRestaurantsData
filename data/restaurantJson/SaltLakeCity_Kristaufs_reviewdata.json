First off, the d\u00e9cor was really cool.  Nice warm ambience, not too crowded, and the layout was just right.  Not too open with unnecessary space.  Dance floor was a good size.  The people were so chill.  The place didn't feel pretentious at all.  Then there was the music...perfect!  Mostly top 40 with a little mix here and there.  We got to the bar and Wes the bartender was professional and hella helped with everything, especially with picking a drink.  I don't drink Martini's often and I really just wanted something strong and not fruity.  Wes HOOKED IT UP!!!  Whatever he made, got my cousin and sister dancing after like 2 sips LMAO.  Anyway, he was hella chill, totally made our night!  If you go there, ask for Wes.  Im sure the other bartenders are cool, but not as cool as Wes haha.  Its a shame we couldn't return the next night.
