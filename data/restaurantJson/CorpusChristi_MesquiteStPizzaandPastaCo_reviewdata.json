He seemed nice at first. He took our order (there were 6 people) but never rode anything down. SO the order was entirely wrong. \n\n1 huge slice of pizza is $8 and only includes cheese. Each veggie added is 50 cents and each meat is $1. \n\n5 of us ordered the huge slices and with everyone wanting different items, it would be a lot for the server to remember, However, since he didn't write down our order, the order was wrong.\n\n My son order 2 veggies plus pepperoni and it came out as 2 veggies plus sausage. When my son told him that his was wrong, the server said \"sorry, it takes too long to make you another pizza\". I responded by saying \"excuse me, that is not the pizza that he ordered and he doesn't like sausage.\" The server responded by saying that he would just throw some pepperoni on there and my son could eat it like that without charging me for the extra meat. I told the server that he doesn't like sausage, it wasn't what he ordered and he should take it back, plus I wasn't paying any extra for something that we didn't order. In the end, the sever had a new pizza made. He told us it would be ready in 20 minutes and it took 5  minutes. \n\nThen my husband ordered the pizza burger with onion rings. He got fries instead. \n\nThe appetizers ordered were pizza fries at $10. They are incredibly salty and so greasy and soggy. Don't waste your money on them. The onion rings say that they are handed breaded but they look and taste like prepackaged frozen rings and the ranch tastes like tartar sauce. \n\nThe sodas are $2.50/each. The server constantly refilled the kids sodas but would never refill my soda or my husbands water. \n \nThe pizza is super thin on crust an not crispy. Everything slides off of the pizza when attempting to eat it. It was ok tasting but not worth the money. \n\nThe last straw was when the server added a 20% tip to the bill automatically without seeing anywhere on the menu that is automatically done for certain party sizes. And then he charged someone elses $118.21 bill on my credit card PLUS my $111.24 bill with his tip. Then came to tell me sorry for the inconvience It should fall off in 3 days. \n\nI am so ticked off at this dinner. The server has a poor attitude and defiantly was not deserving of that tip. I am still sitting here 6 days later waiting for the credit of someone elses bill to go through. \n\nSave yourself the hassle!

But we're always open to suggestions, so we let the waitress know it was our first time there and asked for her recommendation. She told us about this burger.\n\nIt's funny - we've tried quite a few burgers and wonder why some places struggle to keep them juicy.  This was not a question that ever formed here... it was juicy and delicious!  The ingredients were fresh and perfect - not a mealy spot on the tomatoes, nor a brown blemish on the avocado.  Even the red onions were perfectly crisp, sweet, and didn't scald your senses.  Such a great combination of flavors and all on a soft, sweet bun.  Killer sandwich!  \n\nFor sides, we tried the onion rings and the fries.  Both were good, but the fries were seasoned in a way that made you want to devote yourself to a plate of them.  \n\nCrumbling the bacon on the burger seemed like an interesting choice until you realize the reason... it's easy to bite in to!  You're not having to tear through bacon.  The cheese melted over the bacon held it onto the beef patty and they definitely did NOT skimp out on the bacon.  \n\n\u200bYou really just can't go wrong with this burger - it was perfect!

My friend and I shared the Alfredo Bacon Fries which were great! We also shared the garlic knots with the house made marinara. We both love the marinara! The price is average and the staff was friendly.

Everyone who performed was hilarious. Had been wanting to try the pizza because I had heard so many great things about it. My boyfriend and I shared the meatball pizza and both tried a big red margarita. The pizza was basic, tasted like something out of a box, with thin crust. The meatballs were just ground beef, absolutely no flavor. The Big Red Margaritas (admittedly by the bartender) were weak and are never strong. These are $10 drinks mind you. so $20 on two margaritas that were weak, $20 on pizza that was sub-par. Nothing was bad or went wrong, it just wasn't quality food. If I return it will be for the comedy, I'll eat first and have drinks after. Oh, also the server we ordered from definitely seemed in the weeds. she wasn't rude to us but she was very rude to the guy who ordered before us, who coincidentally was sitting right next to us", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-29T10:24:19-0400", "location_id": "8373967", "id": "293782514", "user": {"username": "JoValarie", "user_location": {"name": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "id": "60927"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "For Pizza Lovers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60927-d8373967-r283409009-m11068-Mesquite_St_Pizza_and_Pasta_Co-Corpus_Christi_Texas.html#review283409009", "text": "We wanted to try a new place in town so we dropped by for some pizza.
