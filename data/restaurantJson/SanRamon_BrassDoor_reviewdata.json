From the outside you cannot really gauge what the interior environment will be as it is not easy to look inside from the parking lot. Any windows are facing the street side which seem to be well cordoned off by trees so you don't have to look at the passing traffic which is thoughtful. That's about all I have to say that is positive. After that it kind of goes downhill. It's all about first impressions and for me, they scored low at each experience marker.\nWalking in the door: Well, the Brass Door is no longer a Brass Door. Which immediately sent me a subliminal message that this was a place that was still living in it's own past. Yes, there were photos and memorabilia in the entry showing you that in fact, there had actually been a Brass Door, it USED to be a place where San Ramon would dine and celebrate. It SMELLED like it had been a long time since the carpets were cleaned OR they have a bad case of bar rot behind the bar. Just a really distracting scent of mold / mildew and OLD. \n\nThat did not really make me want to stay and eat lunch to be honest but I thought that maybe I was jumping the gun and would miss a memorable meal by pre judging the situation before giving it a chance.\n\nIn hindsight I truly wish I would have listened to my inner voice.\n\nThe menu is reminiscent of the old Steak House / Martini Lunch Spot with the obligatory Surf and Turf type combo offered, Prime Rib on the Dinner menu, and Clam Chowder as an old steady.\n\nDone well this is actually making a comeback. However, the Clam Chowder was barely warm (not really sure what the problem was: broken soup warmer or was it allowed to sit out after being portioned??) and the rest of the meal was not particularly appetizing. Everything had a \"hologram\" quality to it in that it was a representation of a dish and not actually done well enough to actually BE the dish.\n\nMy father was new in town and I was actually embarrassed that I had recommended this place. I apologized to him. He said that he had made a reservation there for dinner in case we wanted to come back as he was wanted to treat us (he made the reservation BEFORE we had eaten anything, I guess he did it when he excused himself to visit the restroom), however, after the experience, we cancelled the reservation.\n\nI am sorry as this is bound to upset some of the loyal customer base they must have but this was just one of the worst dining experiences I have had. Luckily I did not get sick from the under temp Clam Chowder. There are just too many red flags going up for me there. I cannot in good conscience let it go without comment.\n\nI hope they push themselves to correct their opportunities and take a moment to view the facility with a fresh perspective and see what needs a good sweep, scour and scrub. EVERYONE can benefit from that. Gordon Ramsay would have a field day in this place.\n\nUnfortunately Disappointed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-08-24T19:08:25-0400", "location_id": "779645", "id": "410356656", "user": {"username": "Jennifer D", "user_location": {"name": "San Ramon, California", "id": "33038"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Real good old fashioned food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33038-d779645-r409580064-m11068-Brass_Door-San_Ramon_California.html#review409580064", "text": "I have been here for Brunch and dinner.

My dear hubby and I used to frequent the Brass Door before he passed away, in 2003.  I had not been back to this restaurant since.....until my dear friends took me there to celebrate my birthday.  I was soooo surprised to see (when we first walked in) we were greeted by a waitress who I immediately recognized from days past....and she also remembered me.....wonderful feeling.   We were seated in a very private area and immediately offered something to drink.  The atmosphere was very pleasant and the quietness allowed for \"catch-up conversation\" with my friends.   Everything on the menu sounded so good to me, but I settled for the pan fried sea scallops and substituted au gratin potatoes for the French fries.  When our food arrived, I was delighted that the scallops were the large sea scallops (not the little bay scallops) and were \"done to a turn.\"  They were so yummy, as was the au gratin potato and the cabbage salad.   Our waitress was super attentive and my friends LOVED their entries, as well.   I must say that it was wonderful to dine there again and to know that they are living up to my fond memories of this fine restaurant!\nBon Apitito!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-02T13:42:05-0400", "location_id": "779645", "id": "379170228", "user": {"username": "Ruth R", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
