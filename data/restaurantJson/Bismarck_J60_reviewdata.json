Their beer selection was ok, skewed towards IPA's.  The food was very good and a diverse menu.  The bread and salad to start all tasted fresh.  I had the crab cake, it was just a touch on the salty side but it was full of crab meat and cooked well.  We skipped desert because we were both full.  Service was good, we did not get our appetizer but I'm guessing he missed it because I was also asking questions about the menu.  Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  Of all the restaurants in bismarck, I cannot name a better one to go to.\nNegatives - I would have liked to have seen a broader range of beer selection.  Thought the place was a touch noisy for my taste.

Having recently moved here from one of the country's great restaurant towns (Houston), our dining out experiences have mostly been disappointing. Food here is generally expensive (even in the store), so one often ends up paying more for mediocre food and service than one would like. The opposite is the case at J60, which opened over the summer. First, unlike most Bismarck dining establishments, J60 has excellent front of the house management. The manager, Paulie, is in evidence every night keeping a sharp eye on things and meeting his customers. They make a lot in house - like the excellent bread which arrives with two spreads and the vinaigrette for the salad which contains real live olive oil. The salad, by the way, comes with your meal and is tossed tableside, which is a nice touch. My husband and I have been twice and this is now our go to restaurant. We've sampled the smoked salmon appetizer, the crab cake appetizer (accompanied by arugula/apple salad), delicious beef stroganoff and saut\u00e9ed scallops with black rice. All were top notch and by local standards, very reasonably priced. Service was better than average - our waiter got us out in time the make the symphony on our second visit - and getting better as the wait staff gets more experienced. All in all this place is a winner and I hope they can stay in business!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-21T09:21:28-0400", "location_id": "10543039", "id": "420888657", "user": {"username": "HVane", "user_location": {"name": "Houston, Texas", "id": "56003"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Another great restaurant in Bismarck!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49709-d10543039-r413881489-m11068-J_60-Bismarck_North_Dakota.html#review413881489", "text": "The atmosphere is very modern though it did seem pretty loud.

It was a heap of crab cake type of substance plopped on the rice then baked. So the top had a little crust but the middle and bottom of the crab cake was soggy. It should have been a crab cake that was fried then placed on the rice. Crab cakes are fried on both sides. \nThe other problem was we kept having fruit flies all around us.
