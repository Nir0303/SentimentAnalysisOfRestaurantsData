I've eaten them all over the U.S.\n\nThe local JIB on O'Connor in Irving is just ok.  They always take a while to have your order ready for you.  My wife and I went there today @ 1:30 pm and waited about ten minutes for our order.\nThree other people were waiting ahead of us and I saw about five or six cars in the drive thru line.\n\nI think since it is an older JIB maybe they have a smaller grill/prep area.  Either way, it takes longer that I'm used to for fast food.\n\nOur burgers were good but a bit dry...even the Ultimate Cheeseburger with extra mayo.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-06-28T13:39:46-0400", "location_id": "4884441", "id": "212520318", "user": {"username": "Grant W", "user_location": {"name": "Irving, Texas", "id": "56032"}}}]}
