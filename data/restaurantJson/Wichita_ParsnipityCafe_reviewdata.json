Serving food from 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Chef Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork started this cafe to fill a much-needed gap serving the many businesses inside the Epic center, as well as the surrounding buildings including the city building and the county courthouse. The day I went was a \"government\" holiday and so Chef Cynthia was able to spend some time with me when I expressed interest in writing a review. \n\nParsnipity Cafe has a menu featuring items for breakfast, lunch, the onsite bake shop and snack items. There is a small salad bar. Some of the unusual and popular items include the Pig Candy Waffle Sandwich (it's a maple-glazed bacon/waffle concoction), Fried Cornmeal Mush Stick with syrup, Power Toast - a take-it-with-you breakfast of house-made 12 grain bread with a variety of toppings. There are a variety of breakfast burritos and sandwiches available. After lunch, deli sandwiches are available when Parsnipity turns into an Internet Cafe, also offering baked goods, smoothies and coffee, including the \"Parsnipity Blend\", made locally just for the cafe.\n\nThere is a special every day. Since the website is under construction and up soon, I perused Parsnipity's very informative and interactive Facebook page to see some options. One that looked delicious was 1/2 Cornish game hen with barley pilaf and peas. Another was Butter Poached Shrimp over grits, served with served with a choice of either Pork Roast and Barley Soup or Broccoli Salad. There is a sandwich special every day, as well. It could be a meatloaf sandwich or a pulled pork with homemade BBQ sauce and potato salad. \n\nI decided I wanted to try Parsnipity Cafe's two best-sellers, the Coronation Chicken Salad and the fried Lumpia. A LOT of food, but I was determined. I had the Coronation Chicken Salad in a spinach wrap with lettuce and cheese. This chicken salad is the most unusual and flavorful that I have ever eaten; golden raisins, mayo, curry and something I couldn't quite identify until Chef Cynthia told me there was some apricot preserves in there among some other wonderful flavors. The Lumpia is defined as a Philippino egg roll. Chock full of meat and veggies, these fried rolls are served with sweet and sour sauce. My food was very good. I loved the daring and interesting flavors that Chef Cynthia incorporates into her foods. Just that day she let me sample some of the sweet Lumpia she's experimenting with; banana and Nutella was one. Yum!\n\nThe cafe boasts floor to endless-ceiling windows in a huge lobby serving as the dining space, making it bright and cheerful. There is a lovely venue available right off the main lobby/cafe for hosting parties and business meetings. Chef Cynthia offers catering for these events or guests may order from the menu. She does not charge to use the room if she provides the food. \n\nIt's worth the trip negotiating downtown traffic to go visit Parsnipity Cafe. And if you work downtown? What a treat for you!", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "CynthiaWilson, Owner at Parsnipity Cafe, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for your lovely review.
