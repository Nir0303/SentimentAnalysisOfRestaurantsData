They are placed in picture frames which is cool but the TV's were so distracting. Here we are having a quiet family dinner with the Godfather & Rocky all over the walls. Come on this is not a sports bar. There are many classier Italian restaurants that have better food & cheaper drinks.

What a mistake!!! The waitstaff could barely hear our questions about the menu, the food took an hour to come out ( between salad and entrees), and there was a complete disconnect between us and the waitstaff. I will say that this was more likely caused because of the amount of customers as well as the painfully loud sounds if the motorcycles cruising up and down the street.

The dressing was maybe a creamy Italian, it was very bitter. As for the waiters they were all very friendly and we had great service.
