I order the 2 fish meal that came with hushpuppies. I asked what the side were- there were 3 sides! coleslaw, hushpuppies and fries. So since it came with the hushpuppies and I could have 2 sides guess what I picked-coleslaw and fries which I didn't want. I wanted a vegetable like the green beans they show on the website.  This will be my last trip here for a while.  The fish is heavily battered and greasy, the fries are good and the hush puppies are great, but I can really taste the salt in them.  Service was fine, but he didn't give any apology so I have to assume this is their menu because the website says it varies by store.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-24T19:09:10-0400", "location_id": "4517243", "id": "396436874", "user": {"username": "411margaretb", "user_location": {"name": "Glendale, Arizona", "id": "31231"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "It's fish...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31308-d4517243-r353942378-m11068-Long_John_Silver_s-Peoria_Arizona.html#review353942378", "text": "What can be said about a restaurant chain that has been around for ages?

So, off we went to try LJS again after not even seeing one in 30 years. \n\nNot much different from the last visit. I had the cod and shrimp platter. It came with a side of fries and coleslaw. A nice touch were the little packets of everything that you could try to flavor up the meal...And it needed it. Shrimp, okay. Cod, okay. Fries, kinda okay. Hush puppies, not quite as I remember them, but okay. Coleslaw, I didn't try - I don't eat fast food mayo anything. \n\nIt's fast food.
