It seems to have turned into a drunk fest on a regular basis.  \n\nWhen I was in (the LAST time I will go in) I could not help but hear the owner Dave screaming and swearing at someone.  The vulgar language was such a put off as there were a few customers in the place trying o eat.  We were all shocked at the language he was screaming in public.  DEFINITELY NOT A PLACE TO BRING CHILDREN.\n\nThere are too many other good places to dine in the downtown Worcester area, places that have real class and great food.

We thought we would try it out and were pleasantly surprised because there have been a number of restaurants in this space over the last couple years and they haven't made it so far.  The bartender, Amy, was wonderful.  She was pleasant, efficient and friendly.  The wings were ok, not that great but we like the idea of all you can eat wings to help deal with the cost of going out and paying for drinks and other food.  We could only give the food 3 stars, but that was only based on the wings.  The menu looked tasty and creative so we will be back to check out the other stuff next time.  We think they should continue to advertise and I suggested to Amy that they look into Restaurant.com and groupon, as I know quite a few of my friends, as well as ourselves,  love these sites and we are NOT cheap we just want to help alleviate some of the cost because we love to go out :)  We would also suggest that they think about having the kitchen stay open longer, until at least 11 p.m. even if it is just serving bar apps.  They currently close at 9 p.m.  We think having a place that people know they can get something to eat encourages people to go, eat and then hang out.  Since it is in downtown Worcester parking will probably be an issue, but first I guess you have to get the people there and then maybe offer a way to help people figure out the parking!  We would love to see them do well and stay.  There are not really many pub / sports type places to go in Worcester that aren\u2019t chains.
