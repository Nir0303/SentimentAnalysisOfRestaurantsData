THE best sushi in Tuscaloosa. I have been going there for years, and used to every Tuesday with a group of \"girls\" for Ladies Night (1/2 price wine). Although I go more infrequently now, it NEVER disappoints. I was not even a big sushi fan until I had it at Chuck's... it is SO fresh, and perfect, that I am spoiled and cannot handle anything less anywhere else. The sashimi appetizer is also SOOOOO good ... the freshest (and prettiest too!) tuna and salmon. I am craving sushi as I write this. ... My favorites? The Dat or the Amazon. A friend and I got the Kaos roll once - VERY spicy, so beware of that one if that is not your thing. Be sure to try the Uptown Shrimp at least once - similar to the Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish Grill. They used to do a pretty good discount on the Uptown Shrimp on Wednesdays, I believe, but I am not sure if that is still the case. \n\nFor your dinner entr\u00e9e, if you want to spring for the filet, it is WORTH it. One of the best pieces of red meat I have had in Tuscaloosa - melt in your mouth, cooked to perfection (I get mine medium rare). \n\nAlso, remember 1/2 price wine on Tuesdays. And this may sound silly to some, but their wine glasses are thin-lipped, which somehow makes the wine taste a little better to me, and it just \"feels\" better. And the wine is always perfectly chilled. \n\nI don't have a negative word to say about Chuck's: every food item on their menu - absolutely fresh, the highest quality, and prepared perfectly; the atmosphere - wonderful - so nice and cozy, but not too formal; the service - not a lot of turnover with staff, even over YEARS of coming in, which speaks volumes for ownership / management, and they ALWAYS remember who I am and what I like - much appreciated. \n\nIf I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-15T07:27:24-0400", "location_id": "1017487", "id": "418836474", "user": {"username": "Laurie_A_A_PG", "user_location": {"name": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama", "id": "30889"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Outstanding", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30889-d1017487-r418460286-m11068-Chucks_Fish-Tuscaloosa_Alabama.html#review418460286", "text": "Outstanding food, creative dishes and cool atmosphere.
