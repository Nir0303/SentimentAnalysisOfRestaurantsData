It came out very fresh, aromatic, well seasoned but not excessively hot/spicy.  Just right to my taste.  Some in our party were vegetarian:  the no-meat curries were excellent too.  My wife's brother got a yellow curry with soft tofu.  I tasted it and liked it.  Another plus is they serve both white rice and brown rice.  Only a couple of things keep me from giving it 5 stars:  Decor here is very simple and plain and a bit shop-worn.  Server was new to this restaurant  but still was attentive, polite, and enthusiastic.  Would definitely go here again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-14T21:58:30-0400", "location_id": "1943825", "id": "318826947", "user": {"username": "Gregory D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Yum Thai", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31281-d1943825-r318823499-m11068-Nunthaporn_s_Thai_Cuisine-Mesa_Arizona.html#review318823499", "text": "Low key establishment.
