It's an actual family style restaurant where you get seated and waited on versus every other Hawaiian place I've been where you order at a counter and then pick up your food when it's ready so that was nice. The space is large but comfortable and has a tv in case there is a Seahawks game on like it was when I visited but you can't see it from everywhere and there is only 1 so keep that in mind. \n\nWhenever I visit a Hawaiian restaurant for the first time, I always order the Kalua Pork with cabbage. It's a staple of Hawaiian cuisine and fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you see it, it's like pizza. Even if it's bad, it's still pretty good. If I go back a second time, I'll order a Lau Lau plate but I noticed that on Bobby's menu, it describes their Lau Lau plate as pork wrapped in fig leaves. True Lau Lau as you might know is butterfish, not pork so I don't think I'll be back to order that. One thing about Hawaiian restaurants is that they are few and far between so unless you want to travel, you're kinda stuck going to the closest place to your home. At least with Bobby's, that's not a completely horrible thing. \n\nSome of might complaints are they only give you a fork and one napkin. Hawaiian food can get messy so having multiple napkins would be nice and at the end of my meal when my plate was nearly clean, it would have been nice to have a knife or a spoon even to help me get those pesky remnants on to my fork. I had an order of the Lumpia and it was good but I would have liked to have more sweet chili sauce to dip them in. Their teriyaki sauce was tasty but refrigerated so I quickly dropped the temperature of my food while applying the sauce to it and halfway through my meal, I was asked if I was done with it so that they could give it to another table to use. I was okay with it but I'd really like to see them have enough bottles so that each table could have their own.\n\nThey offer a few mixed drinks and they have a nice selection of beer in bottles plus wine if you'd rather. Overall I wasn't disappointed and I will definitely be back when I'm in the Lynnwood area. \n\nPro tip: The Everett location is closed. The Lynwood location is the only location but your GPS may tell you otherwise.\n\nThanks for reading.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-08-30T19:06:41-0400", "location_id": "884904", "id": "305160676", "user": {"username": "mrbraae", "user_location": {"name": "Federal Way, Washington", "id": "58471"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Hard to spot off hwy 99", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58466-d884904-r304803141-m11068-Bobby_s_Hawaiian_Restaurant-Everett_Washington.html#review304803141", "text": "I love Loco Moco, and this establishment does it very well.

It's not gourmet. It's not fancy. It IS, however, excellent Hawaiian-style home cooking, and for a great price. You definitely won't go home hungry from Bobby's! The portions are ample, Hawaiian comfort food at its best. Yes, the mac salad and white rice are on the bland side, but for those familiar with Hawaiian cooking, that's the way they're supposed to be. If you want something popping with exciting or spicy flavor, you want to look for a different kind of restaurant. The chicken katsu has been my regular order up until a couple of weeks ago, when I tried the pork chops katsu: the breading is nice and crispy, the pork chops incredibly moist and thick and delicious. We recently tried the lumpia basket appetizer, which comes with a sweet/spicy dipping sauce\u2014wonderful! My husband's favorite is the Loco Moco, scoops of white rice covered with hamburger patties and gravy and topped with a fried egg. The desserts on offer are basically cake with different fillings. The white cake with fruit-flavored filling is nothing special, but the chocolate cake with chantilly cream filling and frosting is heavenly! They seem to run out of this quickly (not a surprise that it's popular!), so if you go on a weekend, go early. That would also help with the seating. Recently Bobby's moved to Lynnwood in the Lake Serene area at 14626 Hwy 99, Suite 101 (in a small red-brick strip mall); note that the address and picture here on Trip Advisor are outdated, showing the pre-April 2013 storefront and address. Parking at the new location is ample; their new space is quite a bit bigger and they now have seating available while you wait for a table. Prices are on the low side of average; entree with mac salad and rice is about $8-13 depending on what you get. Desserts are around $4 but the size is generous. The waitstaff are friendly and are pretty good about checking back to see how the food is, keep drinks refilled, etc.; possibly a bit less so at busy times on weekends or when they have large parties in the banquet room. The booths are, thankfully, not ones you have to squeeze into so tightly that you can hardly breathe. And they are long enough to comfortably seat 6, so family groups can be easily accommodated. (There is also some table/chair seating.) Their website has the new address and shows their menu. Again, don't come here expecting a gourmet experience or a new-age fusion menu.
