As a business don't you think you should check your draft beer before you open? Anyway, as we were sitting there we were smelling this horrible smell. We narrowed it down to 1) The glass cabinet- Glasses were upside down with the rim on the bottom of the cabinet.  I noticed the dirt, and dust and who knows what else and ask for a straw. 2) The moldy, dusty, nasty motor on the cooler.  It seemed like every time they opened it, we smelled \"the smell\". 3) Could have been the nasty Tabs from the draft beer that looked like mold could grow any second, or trip catchers under them that when I leaned over the bar seen \"junk\" floating in them.  4) Every time we tried to move our feet and unstick them from the floor \"The Smell\" returned.

More of a late night atmosphere. Definitely the best party bar in Louisville! Great music lots of fun! The staff is super friendly and has a great time. More of a college bar but a wide range of people end up there. Even after I graduated college it is still one of my favorite places to go!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-08-06T18:13:21-0400", "location_id": "838054", "id": "171118792", "user": {"username": "Leigh W", "user_location": {"name": "Louisville", "id": null}}}]}
