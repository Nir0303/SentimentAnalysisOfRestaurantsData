This is the place.   The food is reasonably priced and tasty, the atmosphere is great and the live music is second to none.  It's a great night for dancing every single night.   Singles, couples and adult family gatherings are perfect at the Cape.  The Management of this place is stellar.   Friendly and welcoming all of the time.    The wait staff is equally stellar.   If you've been there at least once, it's likely that your face will be remembered and your drink order will also be remembered if you get the same wait staff.   We simply love Cape Cabaret and we're quite sure you will also.

Music was great as always! Food actually blew us away as the quality was substantially better than the last time. My only complaint is that though they are working at upgrading the interior, get the walls painted and remove the old carpet. Unfortunately it still looks like the \"Other Place\" and people still see this which does hurt the new image being created.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-10T10:35:18-0400", "location_id": "9602317", "id": "391081003", "user": {"username": "Don V", "user_location": {"name": "Cape Coral, Florida", "id": "34118"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great Night Out!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34118-d9602317-r390072822-m11068-Cape_Cabaret-Cape_Coral_Florida.html#review390072822", "text": "My friends and I recently heard about this venue and decided to try it.

One of us had the chicken cordon bleu which she said was great.  The Gatlin Show was excellent!  They are incredible performers and I highly recommend seeing their show.  Cape Cabaret has entertainment most nights of the week.  We were able to dance all night on a large dance floor.  You can check their calendar on their website.

This is a fairly new establishment in downtown Cape Coral.The decor was a bit of a tip off: bland like a Holiday Inn lobby. The tables are arranged around a nice stage setting. Granted, we did have a table of eight, but the waiter came up, took our drink order rather promptly and then apologized that he had several other large tables \"before us\" and that it would be awhile before he took our dinner order. My drink was TOTALLY wrong-how a bartender thinks that he/she should put vermouth in a vodka martini is beyond me-even after I specified \"nothing in it but a twist of lemon-NO VERMOUTH\". UGH. The wait to place our dinner order was well over an hour. One guest got up and got bread for us. The wait for the food was about 45 minutes more. I'm guessing that the salad: two cherry tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, piece of red onion and sliver of cucumber, was made yesterday. Dressings were unceremoniously plopped in the center of the table in metal cups-our party had to pass them around to the right person.The food was for the most part, cold and unappetizing. Do not have the fried chicken. I was WAY overcooked, and the meat, bone dry. My boyfriend had the seafood pasta which he said was good.\nThe Rod Stewart impersonator was mediocre. We left early. On the way our the hostess asked us how we liked everything. I told her that the food was awful. She asked what was wrong. I didn't want to regale her with my critique. Horrible.
