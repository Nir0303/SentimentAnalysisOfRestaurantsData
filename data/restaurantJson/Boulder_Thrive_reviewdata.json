I really love \"raw nori wrap\" and \"sammich\". Love love love it!  \nFrankly, for me, I don't think it needs soy sauce on the side for raw nori wrap, it already had great natural taste and wasabi taste. The soy sauce just makes wrap too salty, IMHO. \nThe bread used for the \"sammich\" is also really delicious! I hardly eat bread in daily life though this bread taste like a nuts and peas. Nutty and crunchy texture and flavor. \nThis place is definitely top notch for genuine vegan people. Excellent for take away but perhaps not great as an eatery place since they don't have any real plates and utensils.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-01T14:34:31-0400", "location_id": "10789376", "id": "433775065", "user": {"username": "Laura H", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Creative smoothies & salads with a groovy new age vibe", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33324-d10789376-r422284893-m11068-Thrive-Boulder_Colorado.html#review422284893", "text": "Came in for a smoothie one morning with a friend and was impressed with the creative selections on the menu.

Over the 20 years that I have lived here, I have seen many restaurant incarnations in this location, and I've never darkened the doors of any of them...until now.\nThrive is really great, and is filling a much needed gap in the Boulder food scene. This place is raw, veg, sprouted, kind goodness. \n\nI had some flax crackers with their cashew nacho 'cheese', and some vegan broccoli cheese soup. Everything was outstanding. Several people around me were ordering some type of vegan shake that looked amazing. I'm definitely trying that next time.\n\nI thought the prices were very good considering the care that is going into sourcing and prep. It is of course run by the Boulder hippie kind, so service is slower than to be expected for a 'fast casual' type place. However, it is definitely worth the wait. \n\nI'm honored to write your first review and wish you tons of success.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-27T21:15:53-0400", "location_id": "10789376", "id": "411652752", "user": {"username": "Amy W", "user_location": {"name": "Boulder, Colorado", "id": "33324"}}}]}
