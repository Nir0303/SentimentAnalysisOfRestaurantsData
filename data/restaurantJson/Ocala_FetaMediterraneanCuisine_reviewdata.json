I love to try as many dishes as possible, so the sampler entree was the perfect choice for me.  It came with a decent portion of 5 different items.  My guest got the lamb burger and was also impressed. I grabbed baklava for dessert.  We arrived around 8pm and it was not crowded at all.  It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to going back again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-12T08:51:23-0400", "location_id": "3650774", "id": "372379967", "user": {"username": "Angelle R", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
