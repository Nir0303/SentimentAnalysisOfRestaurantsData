The innkeepers are great designers, not only of the facility but of the way they foster human interaction with it.  And this goes for the Adobe's location in the Santa Cruz core.  Easy access to the city center makes this particularly attractive.  We walk to great restaurants...and then head up Hwy 1 to Wilder Ranch Park for nature walks.

And incidentally, though the inn is often full, we've hardly ever bumped into anyone else.  It's a magical place.  And one time we had a problem with a squeaky bed and left a comment.
