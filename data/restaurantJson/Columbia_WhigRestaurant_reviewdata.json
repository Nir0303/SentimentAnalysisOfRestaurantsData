I had heard great things about it and seen it walking past the State House a couple of times so finally decided to try it out with my girlfriend last night for dinner.\nLuckily I read some information online about going down the stairs and opening the large metal door so we got in. First, let me say the one positive thing about my experience was the decor and style of the place, I thought it was really cool how the area at the bottom of the stairway was lit with red lights and the inside of the Whig was low lit and decked out in interesting pieces. Don't know of any other place like it, so that was really neat. However, once we stepped inside and looked around the neatness stopped. Nobody said anything and we didn't see anyone to talk to about a table or anything so we just sat down. Upon sitting down the only thing on the table was a beer menu so we made up our minds on our beers of choice and just sat and waited....still nothing. After about 5 minutes we were wondering if anybody was gonna grab our order or anything but then I noticed everyone going up to the bar to order so I decided to check that out. Turns out Tuesday nights only serve tacos as the sole menu item. After some strange looks from the people inside we decided to leave and go to another restaurant down the street.\n I admit I have limited dive bar experience but some signs on the door or upfront letting newcomers know about how the place is run would be nice. Feels like a place that definitely caters to its usual crowd that knows what is going on there. I guess my girlfriend and I just didn't fit into that crowd.

This is my new favorite place in Columbia!\n\nAll you need to know is they have a jukebox, an Atari game that has PacMan and Galaga, and a good beer list that even includes draft cider.\n\nFor food we tried the fries with gravy and cheese for an appetizer. The portion was huge... more of an appetizer size for four people than two. I had the chicken sandwich which came with pimento cheese.
