I am happy to report that this is not the case. In fact, everything is house-made and i find the food to be fairly honest. They also have a thriving bar scene with a selection of bourbons that is downright impressive. On my last visit, they were out of the house made bitters they use for my favorite drink, the Old Fashioned, but there are plenty of other fish in that sea and the drinks are nice sized and well made.\n\nThe problem with Granville is the service. On almost every visit, but especially between shifts like at 3-5pm, the service is spotty to the point of non-existent. The servers are also trained in a style I describe as California Over Share, and the announcing of names and banter are a little off-putting for me. I have had some good and professional servers, but I've had some that were definitely in the wrong business who do things like deliver one dish without the others or without side dishes and who go to other tables to take orders when they should be heading straight to the kitchen when there's a high priority need like a missing sauce or even cutlery. These things would be easily fixed with some good training, but I've had some pretty bad experiences with two plus hour lunches.\n\nThat all said, there is some GREAT food on this menu. My personal favorite is the Thai Ginger Salad with\nMango, soba noodles, slaw, avocado, peanut and candied ginger with grilled salmon as my protein choice.The Spring Chicken salad comes with chicken only, but it's wonderful and filling and worth a trip in itself. \n\nOn a recent visit I had the Thick Cut Pork Chop a 12 oz bone-in chop, cajun-rubbed, cran-mango compote, sauteed spinach, yukon russet mashed potatoes which was as good as anywhere i've ever had it, with a thick juicy chop and excellent flavor and proper cooking temperature of just barely pink in the center. The burgers and especially the fries are above average, and there are thin crust artisan pizzas, pastas and an extremely long list of interesting and tasty side dishes available. \n\nThe food is well above average for a place like this. It's fresh and honest and the portions are generous. I like the environment inside with large plants and trees and stacks of firewood along the far wall. I also enjoy the covered outdoor patio at lunch time, complete with bar seating and a lot of tables and banquettes. Frankly, I like it so much, that I am anxious to go whenever can, as long as I feel like I have the time to spare in case I have one of the many slow servers I've had in recent months. I do wish they'd work out their server issues.

The wait ended up being less than the estimated 20 minutes. \n\nThey offer a lot of non-gmo and natural, healthy options which wasn't important to us, but would be to a lot of people. I had a burger and fries which was OK. The burger was very thick, but pretty dry. The fries were good but nothing special. My husband had a turkey sandwich and chips which again was good but not exceptional. \n\nOur server was very good, but went on break while we were waiting for our food. The food took quite a while because they apparently prepare everything fresh after you order it. \n\nWe sat in the area in the front of the restaurant which is open-air with a view of the street outside. The weather was perfect so this was a nice option. Would probably try something different though if we ever returned to the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-30T16:42:36-0400", "location_id": "824341", "id": "423953938", "user": {"username": "Lori M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "casual, healthy, super fresh, delightful flavors and most satisfying", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32123-d824341-r419994311-m11068-Granville-Burbank_California.html#review419994311", "text": "This is the perfect spot and my favorite so far in Burbank, CA.  They boast their food items are made from 'scratch' and indeed, they use fresh produce and herbs.  We had outstanding sandwiches with nice, and unusually treated sides such as Greek salad, seasoned french fries.  If you love bacon, this is a must do as they have crisp sweet non fatty bacon in the turkey and chicken sandwich with your choice of breads.  This place is popular and does not take reservations so either go early or expect to wait for a while.  There are a few sidewalk tables and indoor tables and a full bar.  Our only criticism is the  cocktails are weak, minimalistic and cost about $10.
