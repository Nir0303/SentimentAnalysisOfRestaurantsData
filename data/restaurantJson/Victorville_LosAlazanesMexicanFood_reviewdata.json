Since it was so late, nothing was open except McDonalds and Steak n Shake and I did not want that.  This was a little Mexican drive thru open 24 hours, they have inside seating during the day.  The drive thru did have cars and filled up quickly so to me that is a good sign.  It took awhile  but t.he lady in front of me ordered a couple bags.  I figured this was being made from scratch which it was.  There were so many choices but I picked the 2 beef burrito combo plate with rice and beans.  The burritos had actual hunks of beef.  It was not ground beef. Also had peppers, jalepenos, tomato and both were giant. The carry out box was so heavy! Hot and delicious would definately repeat visit if I lived or was in this area. Plate was $7. 00 and could have fed more than 1 person if I wasnt so hungry.
