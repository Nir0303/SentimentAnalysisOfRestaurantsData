We were greeted by a very friendly server, Michelle, and were promptly seated along with a high chair for my 3 year old. The menu was pretty extensive and included all the usual \"tavern type foods\", burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads and a few entrees also. We tried the sandwiches and soup. The Rueben I ordered was very good and served with pub fries. The fries had a garlic type coating similar to garlic parmesan wings, and were very flavorful. Due to the kitchen having problems with their tomato bisque soup, I had the French onion soup. It was served in the classic bowl with a generous coating of cheese and a huge piece of bread under it. The soup tasted great and was served promptly. Michelle kept checking on us and keeping our drinks filled and my 3 year old entertained which was very much appreciated :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-12T23:00:48-0400", "location_id": "8423268", "id": "288392530", "user": {"username": "disneyguy333", "user_location": {"name": "Clifton Park, New York", "id": "47491"}}}]}
