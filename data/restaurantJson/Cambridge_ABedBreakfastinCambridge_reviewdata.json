It looked like it hasn\u2019t been renovated since the Victorian times. The interior proved to be much worse. \nThe B&B was on the 3rd floor, so we had to haul our suitcases up a narrow, dusty staircase. Upon our arrival on the 3rd floor we had to navigate a very narrow, dark and dusty corridor to our room. Our room was even worse, but before we could even look around the manager insisted on us paying \u201cupon arrival\u201d. If we had any choice we would have left immediately, but we were tired after a long flight and we didn\u2019t know where else to go.\nBottom line; we stayed and suffered. Our room was full of old, worn-out furniture which had nothing to do with antiques as they had advertised. The beds were simply uncomfortable (mattresses and pillows need to be replaced). Everything was dusty, and the window frame and the armchair had layers of dirt on them. Under a chest of drawers there was a box with a fire escape equipment which had about 2cm of dust on it. The curtains on the windows and over the bed were dusty as well, the air-conditioning unit old, dirty and loud. The bathroom was shared and in a Victorian condition as well. Every time you had a shower you could be sure to find interesting leftovers of your predecessor in the bathtub. The garbage bin in the bathroom wasn\u2019t emptied for several days. The ironing board was so incredibly dirty and ancient that we just gave up any thought of using it.  The kitchen was doubling as the common room and the laundry room. The cabinets were beyond cleaning and there were wires hanging about. The porch was full of old, broken equipment and furniture and the chairs and table were simply dirty. \nThis B&B was definitely not a place to feel comfortable in. \nThe only highlight was the live-in manager, who was always very entertaining and helpful. He prepared a fresh and home-made breakfast every day, which could have varied more, but was nevertheless delicious. \nFor what it offered, this place was definitely a rip-off. It is always a question of what you get and what you were promised for your money, and in this B&B we certainly didn\u2019t get what we had been promised.", "helpful_votes": "7", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-15T11:17:46-0400", "location_id": "208226", "id": "229064064", "user": {"username": "Liz H", "user_location": {"name": "Hamburg, Germany", "id": "187331"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Low standard, overpriced, good location", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d208226-r225134462-m11068-A_Bed_Breakfast_in_Cambridge-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review225134462", "text": "I booked this B&B based on the great reviews and got seriously disappointed.

My son & I spent 5 days there while exploring the city.\n- Room: our room felt smallish because we had 2 twin beds, however it was extremely comfortable. In particular the bedding is super nice with down comforters and pillows. The room was very quiet and we (over) slept supremely well. The towels we were given were thick and most excellent. We had lace curtains and antique furniture. \n- Floor: There were 2 other rented rooms on the same floor and we shared a common bathroom. This was never a problem. The bathroom was very well maintained. If a guest wanted to reserve it for a shower at a specific time, there was a small chalkboard where they could write their need.\n- Innkeepers & service: the inn was managed by the owners Doane & Karen, and the innkeeper Byron. They were very attentive, available, and very interesting conversationalists. They know the city very well and can give you advice. Doane & Karen were away for part of our stay, and Byron did a splendid job. putting us at ease, cooking the delicious food, and going out of his way if we needed something. Breakfast was served at 8:30am and prepared fresh every morning: consisted of homemade delicious healthy items: crepes or corn flapjacks with yogurt, homemade jam or marmalade, pure maple syrup, fresh fruit as well as coffee of course and an assortment of tea choices. We appreciated a bit of flexibility in the timing of breakfast as we were catching up on sleep.\n- Amenities: in the hallway of the 3rd floor there was a small library of resources related to the city and to Massachusetts: maps, guide books, pamphlets etc We used one of the books to plan an outing to the North End and look up the Freedom Trail. I enjoyed in particular leafing through a book on the local architecture. There is a gym just across the street that welcomes non-members after 6pm for a $6 fee (they have exercise and weight machines, and a swimming pool). That was very convenient. The wifi internet connection was reliable and very fast.\n- Location. The location is a great asset. The B&B is a 5 minute walk from Harvard Square, walking through the Harvard Yard. Coming into the city, we had a free ride on the Subway from the Airport. Harvard Square has countless nice restaurants, bookstores, small shops as well as street performers. From there it is very easy to catch the subway to any other part of the city. Cambridge/Boston also have a well established bus system so it was very easy to get anywhere. \nIf we visit Boston/Cambridge again we would love to stay again at the Cambridge B&B.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-29T18:44:39-0400", "location_id": "208226", "id": "207957159", "user": {"username": "Aida Y", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-10", "title": "Hospitality", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d208226-r183100105-m11068-A_Bed_Breakfast_in_Cambridge-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review183100105", "text": "It is obvious that Byron's, Karen's and Doane's passion is hospitality.
