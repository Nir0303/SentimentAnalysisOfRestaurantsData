I give it two circles not because it is \"poor\", but because it ranks well below other state historical museums I have visited over the years. For instance, the historical museums in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Carolina are all exciting and extensive, covering multiple floors. This museum is dry, not very innovative and very limited. You can easily see all of it in well under an hour. \nThe main hall itself is beautiful, with a very attractive ceiling from the early 1900s. It houses portraits of all of the state governors through John Rowland, four quilts honoring the Underground Railroad, slaves and black history in Ct., and some old-style exhibits on the Charter Oak. In the adjoining rooms there are some exhibits of products once made in Connecticut, and an extensive (but again, very old-style display) dedicated to Colt guns. A Colt aficionado would be very impressed by the collection. \nThe museum is free. Unlike pretty much every state museum I have ever seen, there is no shop connected with it there. However, the state Supreme Court is in the same building and is worth a look as well.  If you like history, particularly of Colt firearms or gubernatorial portraits, it's worth a short visit--but it could use an updating.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-06-21T19:08:10-0400", "location_id": "286041", "id": "132488170", "user": {"username": "Badgerjim", "user_location": {"name": "Augusta, Maine", "id": "29485"}}}, {"lang": "ko", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "\ucf54\ub124\ud2f0\ucef7\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub97c \ud55c\ub208\uc5d0", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33804-d286041-r382112890-m11068-Museum_Of_Connecticut_History-Hartford_Connecticut.html#review382112890", "text": "\ucf54\ub124\ud2f0\ucef7\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\ub97c \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \uc9c0\ub3c4\uc640 \uc720\ubb3c \uadf8\ub9bc\ub4f1\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc798 \uc804\uc2dc\ud574 \ub193\uc740 \ubc15\ubb3c\uad00\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc544\uc8fc \ud2b9\ubcc4\ud788 \uc778\uc0c1\uc801\uc774\uac70\ub098 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc548\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uba74 \uc774 \uc8fc\ub97c \ub354 \uc798 \uc54c\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-13T03:14:42-0400", "location_id": "286041", "id": "382112890", "user": {"username": "StarGold77", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}]}
