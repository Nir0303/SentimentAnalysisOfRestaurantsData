I went there with some friends and had a fabulous time tasting different wines and enjoyed some delicious food!  We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip and Hummus.  Both were served in generous proportions and tasted wonderful.  We then moved on to enjoy an awesome cheese platter that looked as good as it tasted!  A few of us ordered some flatbreads and really enjoyed those as well. Finally....we ordered a chocolate fondue for dessert.  Decadent!!  And I haven't even mentioned the whole Wine experience, which was fun and educational.  The staff seems to be very knowledgeable about the wines and did a great job recommending wine options to those in our group who were not so savvy about wine.  There were a few guys who aren't really into wine, but were very pleased to find that JJs has a full bar with premium liquor and a nice cocktail list.  I'd never experienced the concept of a wine-dispensing machine, but am so glad I got to try this concept out at JJs.  You can choose from almost 30 types of wine, pouring either a one-ounce, five-ounce, or eight-ounce pour.  What a fun way to try wine!  They also have a hefty bottle list, but we were having too much fun with the wine machines!  You can sit inside in their lounge, where the chairs are comfortable and low, and are surrounding a cocktail table, or you can sit in one of their dining rooms at a table. We ventured out to the porch and enjoyed spending the rest of the evening people watching and having a great time.  they also have a quite a bit of seating in the front of the restaurant, if you prefer to sit outside. I LOVED the ladies room at JJs; very stylishly decorated and fun.  And I heard that the men's room is something to see as well.  While were there, a large party arrived and were escorted to one of the party rooms where they had a private party and seemed to be having a blast!  I would definitely look into JJs Wine Bar if I have a private event coming up in the future.  The owners, who were both onsite, were nice and inviting.  They explained how one of them had opened JJs several years ago and the other, who was a long-time customer recently became a partner.  Seemed like they really enjoyed working together.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-20T14:48:26-0400", "location_id": "2229365", "id": "384429342", "user": {"username": "ChowGirl07", "user_location": {"name": "Franklin, Tennessee", "id": "55055"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Cool, fun concept for wine drinkers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55055-d2229365-r375845577-m11068-JJ_s_Wine_Bar-Franklin_Tennessee.html#review375845577", "text": "We didn't know what to expect when we walked into JJ's and saw the wine dispensers on the walls, but it turned out to be one of the coolest wine concepts we've ever encountered.

For as good as it sounds... it is very impersonal.\n\nFirst you go in and hand over your debit or credit card in exchange for a wine card that can be used in the machines. There is a machine with a number of whites, one for reds and one for premium wines. You have a choice of a 1 ounce \"taste\" - or a 5 ounce \"half glass\" or a 7+ ounce \"full glass.\"\n\nSounds good, but overall there weren't that many wines to choose from. At any rate, I chose a half glass of white bordeaux since that was something I hadn't had before. I went out to the front porch to get a table and enjoy it.\n\nThe server was a nice young man who tried to talk me into some food but I wasn't sure I wanted to eat here. He left me a menu to look at and I went back in to get a taste of a premium wine. There were only a few so I chose the most expensive. Instead of $1.50 or so for a taste. like most, a taste of this Napa Valley White was $4.75. I got the one ounce and savored it. Quite good.\n\nThen I decided I WOULD order some food so I got a half glass of a Malbec from Argentina to go with the Black and Blue Flatbread (herbed cheese, roast beef, bleu cheese, mozzarella and sweet onions on a flatbread.) It was rich in berry flavors and mildly tannic. Smooth going down.\n\nBut later I looked up these wines and was disappointed with what I found...\n\nThe white bordeaux was $7.20 for a half glass at JJ's. That same bottle, which is only rated a 3.9, costs $8 retail. Hardly a good wine.\n\nThe expensive \"taste\" - a 2012 Palazzo White - sells a bottle at retail for $55. The full glass price at JJ's is $34.\n\nLastly, the Malbec from Argentina - which I paid $7.50 for a half glass - sells for $10 a bottle retail.\n\nSo let's think about this... Surely a wine bar buys in volume, at wholesale, so these are markups of 500-600 per cent at the least. Hardly a good buy. And I do realize that they need a certain markup to make a profit, but this is either a ripoff or an effort to pay off some expensive machinery. Not to mention that you essentially wait on yourself!\n\nThe \"black and blue flatbread\" was tasty, but shouldn't it be Black and BLEU, considering the BLEU comes from the cheese used? Doesn't \"blue\" mean \"raw\" when it comes to steak or beef??? How can a legitimate restaurant get this terminology confused? Especially when they are trying to be so high brow???\n\nSo while I enjoyed a couple hours on the porch in the evening at JJ's, I wouldn't go back based on the lack of intelligent entree labeling and the overpricing of such mediocre wines. I would much rather go buy a decent bottle (or get a case price) and invite friends over to my own patio. The machines are a gimmick. I don't think they'll last.\n\nStrictly average experience... which will be poor when the newness wears off.\n\nOh! And by the way... I went to get my debit card out of my wallet when it was time to pay and panicked for a few minutes because it was gone. I emptied out my purse looking for it until I remembered I had given it to the cashier to get the wine card to use. Phew! When I mentioned this to her, she commented that people routinely panic when they realize their credit card it missing until they remember she has it. That was NOT fun! And I don't think it is a good idea to turn over a card to ANYONE for several hours.

Plus there is a full bar (beer, spirits, etc.).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-12-09T07:43:07-0500", "location_id": "2229365", "id": "243689724", "user": {"username": "Gr8TravelerTN", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Nice idea, but very expensive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55055-d2229365-r238589591-m11068-JJ_s_Wine_Bar-Franklin_Tennessee.html#review238589591", "text": "We had an arranged gathering last evening at JJ's.  We had prepurchased $100 worth of appetizers and couples bought their wine.\nWhen you arrive at JJ's you are met at the door by the \"cashier\" who takes your credit card in exchange for a JJ's card to be used at their wine vending machines.  I relied on my husband to choose a pinot noir for me.  I accompanied a member of our party to the white wine machines to help figure out the machine system and was amazed at the cost of a half glass and a \"taste\" of each wine.  The selection didn't seem as varied as you might think for a wine bar.  Perhaps they change the wines regularly?\nOur choices and quantities of the appetizers placed in our room was meager, at best.  They clearly subscribed to the less is more cuisine approach where the items were spread out on a large plate.\nThe atmosphere was pleasant, but I would prefer to enjoy my glass of wine at home.\nUpon leaving we were presented with the bill and the tip was mentioned by the cashier.  I kept wondering what we were tipping for since we served ourselves.\nOverall just an okay experience.
