The Restaurant was completely remodel. One side is a Buffet for $9.00 and the other side of the restaurant is an ordinary Chinese restaurant. The food is good and for only $9.00 a person this is very reasonable. My neighbors laughed about it, said you cannot expect much but I am very glad they are wrong. The prices are better than Sweet Tomatoes and I eat there a lot. Now this place has good food for a very inexpensive price. My wife and I have eaten here several times and we can walk out with a good dinner underneath our belts, well at least my belt for just a little over $20.00 with taxes. This place is not a real high end restaurant more of a local family run place that more and more locals seem to enjoy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-14T18:31:02-0400", "location_id": "10547116", "id": "392719815", "user": {"username": "David P", "user_location": {"name": "Denver, Colorado", "id": "33388"}}}]}
