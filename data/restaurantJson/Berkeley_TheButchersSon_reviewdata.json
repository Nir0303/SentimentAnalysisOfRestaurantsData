However, that one visit was a bit of a let down. \n\nLet's be honest, there aren't a whole lot of vegan \"butcher\" shops around. The concept is definitely interesting and when my husband and I were walking by in Berkeley, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it out. \n\nAlthough we don't usually obsess about meat substitutes, fried mozzarella and croissants are not often on a vegan menu!\n\nWe both got seemingly the most amazing choice--meatball sub with fried mozzarella. The sandwich also comes with a side, I opted out for the lesser heart attack with a side of a house-made pickle while my hubby got the bacon macaroni salad (when in Rome, right?)\n\nFirst, the good: the house-made pickle was my favorite part of the meal. It was tangy and crunchy and huge, just like a pickle should be. The macaroni salad with \"bacon\" was also pretty tasty.\n\nNow on to the main meal: the meatball sub was a little weird and unbalanced. First of all, one of the best parts about meatball subs and meatballs in general is the delicious marinara that should be slathered all over it. Unfortunately, in the case of this sad substitute there was maybe a drop of marinara to be found. Then there were the meatballs themselves, they weren't bad exactly, but kind of tasted pretty bland and uneventful. There was not enough spice for the mass of whatever meat substitute they were using. The fried mozz was pretty inventive and definitely not bad, but for some reason it was a bit on the cold side which meant that a lot of leaked out and hardened. \n\nThe space is pretty small and pretty crowded, so if you're going for lunch or dinner at a standard time, I would recommend taking your food to go. \n\nThey also have some interesting looking desserts like cheesecakes and croissants--again not your typical vegan fare. \n\nI would go back to try out the desserts and even more sandwich options, but from my first experience it was all pretty meh. Also, the prices are obviously high (it's a vegan \"butcher\" after all), which would have been fine had the food been as good as it promised to be, but it just wasn't and it sucks to spend close to $15 per person for a sandwich that underwhelms.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-07T11:26:17-0400", "location_id": "10151102", "id": "415843862", "user": {"username": "Natalie V", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Mind game with your taste buds", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32066-d10151102-r407050925-m11068-The_Butcher_s_Son-Berkeley_California.html#review407050925", "text": "This place is 100% vegan and somehow they make everything and it plays games with you.

The food is great. I am VERY impressed.\n\nThis small vegan deli makes excellent sandwiches, and I am not vegan or vegetarian. This is food that even a meat lover like me really loves big flavorful sandwiches. Their salads are good too.\n\nI had the sandwich called \"Grinder\" which I can heartily recommend. The vegan \"meat\" was surprisingly meaty. My friend had a mozzarella and meatball sandwhich, which she loved too. It looked even better than mine!! The sandwiches are huge, and come with a side dish. I ordered \"bacan noodle something\" which was tasty too.\n\nMy mother who joined us for lunch, had a sandwhich she did not like at all. It was called Caprisse or something like that, and she thought it was bland and not worth ordering. So don't order that sandwhich, until they improve it.\n\nThe chocolate chip cookies are big and they have gooey, soft chocolate which I love. The only disadvantage for me is that they sprinkle a bit of salt on the cookies, which some people like because it enhances the flavor, but I am very sensitive to salt and don't want to taste salt in a dessert. \n\nOverall, I give this place a 10 out of 10.
