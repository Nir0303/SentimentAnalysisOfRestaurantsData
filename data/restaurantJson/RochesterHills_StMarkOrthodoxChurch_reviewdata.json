The Church is beautiful and very unique in it's architecture and services. The church was founded in 1980. Andrew Yavornitzky, pastor, has been the priest at St Mark's Church since 1987. Pastor Andrew was one of the most out going and pleasant Pastors I have ever met and talk with. The service he gave with the amount of passion and detail was amazing. The choir which performed during the entire service was very good at what they do also. If I lived in Rochester Hills, Michigan , I would definitely visit this church on a regular basis. Thank You pastor Yavornitzky for a wonderful experience !", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-21T05:25:57-0400", "location_id": "11717869", "id": "430278300", "user": {"username": "grandslamhomer", "user_location": {"name": "El Cajon, California", "id": "32331"}}}]}
