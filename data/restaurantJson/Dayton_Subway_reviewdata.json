After going there 2 years+ I can't recall them ever being out of any sub ingredient except tomatoes one time, but occasionally one of the bread choices isn't \"in stock.\" Their sandwich artists seem to be well-trained and are product knowledgeable and fast. They are friendly and seem to enjoy their work.\nRestaurant is large for a Subway, with several tables for an eat-in lunch, but in an older building with a bit tired 1900's decor. Possibly because of that, the first impression is that the place is not as clean as some of the newer buildouts, but actually it appears to me to be comfortably clean. Entering patrons must walk by the tables to get to the counter, so the atmosphere is \"commuter station busy\" at lunch hour.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-08-12T19:26:48-0400", "location_id": "4764830", "id": "298584791", "user": {"username": "Bill R", "user_location": {"name": "Dayton, Ohio", "id": "60785"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Love their subs but....", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60785-d4764830-r220080738-m11068-Subway-Dayton_Ohio.html#review220080738", "text": "I do love their subs.
