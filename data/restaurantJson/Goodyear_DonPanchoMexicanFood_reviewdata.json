What does the food and quality of one restaurant have to do with another?  But, in this case, given that the competing restaurant (Se\u00f1or Taco) is nearby and the same kind of place, I think it's justified making the comparison this time.\n\nI decided one happy day after the gym, that I'd had enough of Se\u00f1or Taco over and over again and remembered that I had been at Don Pancho's once before and couldn't recall anything negative about it.  So, I figured I'd give it another try.  While not located in the best part of Avondale, it's pretty safe going there during the day.  The inside is decently spacious and the staff is certainly friendly enough; but it didn't take me long to have issues.  First, it was 112F out that day ... and maybe close to mid-80s or more inside.  Yes, they have a/c; but they rely more on the ceiling fans, which, while keeping the place pleasantly cool-ish enough, is hardly comfortable.  I can only imagine what the poor people in the kitchen were going through.  Decor in the place is nice (especially the tilework and art) and the place has an airy and open feel about it (though there are only, maybe, 8 tables or so).\n\nComplaint Number One was the fountain drinks, which, at $2.25 for a large, is far from cheap, but refills from a fountain cost another 99 cents?!?  Truly, I realize restaurants have to make money, too; but the syrup for a soda fountain is hardly a big expenditure and when you consider most restaurants offer free refills, this comes across as a bit tacky.\n\nI ordered two helpings of ceviche (with tostada) and rather than separate the orders, they put them together in one box.  I admit, I didn't ask them to separate them; but before assuming the second person having it was dining with me, it would've been nice to ask whether I wanted them in the same box (to be fair, Se\u00f1or Taco has done that, too; and I now ask them to put them in separate boxes whenever I order two ceviches).  The ceviche tasted good, but, unlike our good friend Se\u00f1or Taco, they don't servie it with any kind of sauce; put one tiny lime wedge in it; and the tostadas are about the size of a DVD disk (i.e., two tostadas for two orders don't cut it).  Quantity was decent, but the fish and veggies are cut up very small and \"seem\" to have less volume than the ceviche at ... you know where.\n\nNext, there was the fish burrito.  Se\u00f1or Taco's fish burrito has a little lettuce, some rice and, I suspect, lots of mayo.  The one here had a lot of shredded lettuce, loose, short-grain rice and no sauce I could detect.  It was good, but, of course, it's the fat that gives flavor.  Also, smaller portion than at Se\u00f1or Taco's on Estrella Parkway, but more expensive.  So ...\n\nFISH BURRITO\n\nDon Pancho:  lots of shredded lettuce; very loose, short-grain rice; not much fish; fat burrito but not very long\n\nSe\u00f1or Taco:  not much lettuce; compact, long-grain rice held together by sauce; large pieces of fish; fat and long burrito\n\nThe shrimp burrito a la diabla was also good, but I couldn't identify the sauce (and there wasn't much of it), there was much more rice and beans, a taste that, while somewhat spicy, was not what I'd call hot.  So ...\n\nSHRIMP BURRITO A LA DIABLA\n\nDon Pancho:  mild and unidentifiable sauce; not much shrimp; lots of rice and beans; fat, but short, burrito\n\nSe\u00f1or Taco:  very spicy and hot sauce; possibly some mayo or other cream sauce; lots of shrimp, fat and long\n\nSo far, Se\u00f1or Taco was beating this place hands down.  I did like that Don Pancho had fresh cucumbers at the salsa stand, though, again, the salsa stand at Se\u00f1or Taco's is more extensive.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nCeviche - much better at Se\u00f1or Taco and only a little more expensive;\nBurritos - much better at Se\u00f1or Taco and cheaper (or the same);\nSoda - cheaper at Se\u00f1or Taco and free refills (or, if not, they never stopped anyone refilling);\nCleanliness - probably the same, but Don Pancho's looks nicer;\nComfort - No comparison.  Se\u00f1or Taco is a walk-in fridge compared to this place;\nCost - Bigger portions and tastier at Se\u00f1or Taco for about the same price or a little less (could be more than a little less if you buy one of their specials).\n\nWould I steer people away from Don Pancho?  No.  The food is good and the people there are really nice.  But having been way too many times to Se\u00f1or Taco, I'm definitely biased.  You'll have to decide whether that bias is justified ... but I think it is.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-10-03T18:06:48-0400", "location_id": "4368675", "id": "424865032", "user": {"username": "alex h", "user_location": {"name": "Goodyear, Arizona", "id": "31234"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Wow", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29038-d4368675-r394805561-m11068-Don_Pancho_Mexican_Food-Avondale_Arizona.html#review394805561", "text": "Food was excellent, quick, hot and delicious.

I will say that I'm starting to believe that some of the best Mexican food I have been tasting is from restaurants in strip malls. This is one of those places you know is going to be good because all the locals are eating here. It's a walk-up and order-off-the-menu-board kind of place, but if this is your first time visiting, they are more than willing to explain the menu and make recommendations. \n\nPaula and I both ordered the #12 combination dinner. They offer quite a few fillings from beef tongue to tripe. I had the tripe, beef, and pork. They were all tender and tasted excellent. Before our dinners arrived, we received some chips and salsa. The chips had beans and cheese on them, but the real winner was the salsa. It had a wonderful kick. Not so overpowering or bland that you didn't want to eat anymore. The dinner also came with a roasted jalape\u00f1o pepper (which was excellently cooked), beans, rice, and a large beverage with free refills. They also have several homemade deserts if you still have room after finishing your meal. \n\nAll in all, I would say that this meal was one of the best meals I have had on this trip. I would highly recommend that you try it for yourself and don't worry at all about it being located in a strip mall.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-03-01T16:28:02-0500", "location_id": "4368675", "id": "257189628", "user": {"username": "David A", "user_location": {"name": "Colchester, Connecticut, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Delicious!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29038-d4368675-r231879940-m11068-Don_Pancho_Mexican_Food-Avondale_Arizona.html#review231879940", "text": "We came here because our other Mexican joint let us down and we are soooooo happy we came!!
