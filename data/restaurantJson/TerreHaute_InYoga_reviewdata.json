There is a Power Yoga class, an Easy Flow class, and others. The cost is $10 for a single class; a punch card saves a little money. Do not eat just prior to class because some of the poses have you lying on your stomach. Try to arrive about 10 minutes before the start of class. Dress in comfortable clothes. Yoga is an excellent stress remover. And it's fun!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-12T07:21:22-0400", "location_id": "10697754", "id": "404533923", "user": {"username": "julie y", "user_location": {"name": "terre Haute", "id": null}}}]}
