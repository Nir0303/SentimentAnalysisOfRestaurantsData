I was very disappointed with the bland and watered down meal I ended up with.  The day we are there, they had already \"ran out\" of various menu items.  Maybe that's why they had added water to the other items to stretch them out. One server was pretty good but several people were also working who seem to have came in off the street and did not know what they were doing. In particular there was one young woman working in pajamas and a sweat shirt.  She was more intent on taking care of a man sitting towards the back, who must have been a boyfriend or even her husband.  She kept taking things to him and running her fingers through his hair and kissing him. Without washing her hands she would occasionally came back and wait on other customers. Food was slow to arrive, with about a five minute gap between the four people I was eating with.  The owners of this restaurant must have another line of work as I cannot see how this place could generate much profit. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-11-16T04:05:49-0500", "location_id": "4648005", "id": "240053383", "user": {"username": "kspast2", "user_location": {"name": "Tulare, Ca", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Delicious Mexican Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33193-d4648005-r200857053-m11068-Mikey_V_s-Tulare_California.html#review200857053", "text": "Everything we order tastes great!
