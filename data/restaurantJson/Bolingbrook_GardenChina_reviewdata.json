My absolute favorite!\n\nHouse Special Lo Mein - Excellent! Wouldn't change anything!\n\nThe last time I was in I wanted to try their BBQ Ribs - 5 ribs for like $5.95 - Huge Flavorful Ribs, not dinky little ones you sometimes get - and they were awesome!\n\nFor all 3 items my bill was under $15 and fed me for 2 days!!!\n\nI've been their twice now in the past month and both times the food has been excellent - and what a Great Value!
