So what was that? A crock of BS.) I had a mixed grill plate with salmon, grilled shrimp and shrimp Alexander. My husband had a Cajun rib-eye steak that was barely seasoned, spinach with mushroom and macaroni-and-cheese. The spinach was bitter and the macaroni-and-cheese was burnt on the bottom. Normally we take our leftovers with us and savor them the next day. Not this time. We just left them there.
