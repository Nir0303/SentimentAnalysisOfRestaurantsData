This year I'm working on being a 78 year old.  In all these years I've always held Ed & Joe's to the highest honor of being the best pizza I've ever had, and believe me, at this age I've had quite a few!  Their thin crust is truly unique, the sausage is wonderful, the sauce is not too much-not too little and just the right sweetness to acidity.  It's nice and cheesy too, real cheese, not the rubbery stuff you can find on a lot of pizzas.  I always get the sausage and cheese pizza, but I'm sure that any added ingredients would probably be wonderful as well.  I now live in the northern suburbs by Wisconsin and on special occasions will make the one hour trip back to Tinley Park just to go visit my favorite Ed & Joe's. I'll bring back extra pizza to freeze too.  Yes, it's that good!  My children  remember it well from growing up as it was always our Saturday night dinner treat.  What a legacy Ed & Joe's has for all the wonderful memories it's left us.  I hope they never change.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-23T06:22:31-0500", "location_id": "490410", "id": "350259789", "user": {"username": "SMQMC", "user_location": {"name": "Round Lake Beach, Illinois", "id": "36635"}}}]}
