Both were pretty spot on for quality and might actually be in the top three Cajun food selections that we've had outside of Louisiana. If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the etoufee was just a tad too spicy - both in terms of being a bit too hot, but also having so much spice that it almost had a gritty texture to it.

Try it out if you like Louisiana style food!\n\nCafe Zydeco is easy to find on Montana Avenue, just a couple blocks east of 27th Street.  The cafe resides in one of the historic buildings downtown and therefore the atmosphere is quite unique.  There are not a lot of seats available in the front but the place did not seem crowded.  The high-top table chairs were plush and comfortable. You order from the counter but can request a menu to peruse if you prefer. Definitely a win on the atmosphere overall, my only \"complaint\" is that there was pretty limited seating and it could get pretty full pretty quickly. \n\nI ordered the special, Jambalaya with corn fritters, for $9.95 and it came with a soda that I served myself. When my order arrived, I was surprised by the ample serving and was very pleased with the aroma.  The jambalaya was spicy but not over-done and the corn fritters were crispy outside and full-flavored inside.  They have a selection of hot sauces, which I tried and found that the Garlic Tabasco complimented quite nicely.  The andouille sausage was nicely sizzled, the shrimp cooked but firm, and the rice was nicely covered with sauce - not too much, not too little. \n\nI was able to eat all of what I was given but am a little over-full.  A smaller person would most likely leave with extra. \n\nI noticed that they have a Reuben sandwich on their menu, and being a lover of Reubens, I will return to give theirs a try.  I have been on the search for the world's best Reuben sandwich and have yet to find THE one...\n\nBottom line, go there and get some great Cajun / Louisiana style food.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-01-07T09:58:35-0500", "location_id": "5570504", "id": "338247479", "user": {"username": "Jerod S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Authentic Cajun Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45086-d5570504-r331921573-m11068-Cafe_Zydeco-Billings_Montana.html#review331921573", "text": "We have had brunch and lunch here and everything was delicious.
