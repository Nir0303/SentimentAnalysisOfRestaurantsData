The building is older, as in 70s style from the outside. The inside has been completely remodeled and is very modern. I was greeted enthusiastically by the front desk personnel. They were engaging, yet professional. It was a nice change from the monotone, fake smile that I usually find at the front desk. \nThere is a small gift shop and concession room next to the front desk and the conference rooms are close.\nThe room is very spacious and updated. The bathroom was a little tight. I had to move around the toilet to close the door. Didn't matter much for me since I was alone, but it's worth mentioning.\nThe bed was a quality mattress, and there were several pillows all of varying degrees of fluff and flat. I found a couple that I liked. The soaps and shampoos were rather nice smelling. \nIt was a short walk to the breakfast area, which is also the bar and supper area. Breakfast was the average free hot breakfast fare. Eggs, bacon, a machine that makes pancakes, juice, fruit and yogurt. \n\nIt may seem out dated on the outside but it has been updated and maintained on the inside. You will be surprised. There is also quite a bit of parking and the drive way goes all the way around the building, in case you are pulling a trailer.\nThe staff is the best element to this hotel. I would definitely stay there again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-11-02T07:08:25-0400", "location_id": "223557", "id": "433977599", "user": {"username": "Dave W", "user_location": {"name": "Rawlins, Wyoming", "id": "60539"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "BEST STAY AS ALWAYS", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60437-d223557-r432223128-m11068-Ramada_Plaza_Casper_Hotel_and_Conference_Center-Casper_Wyoming.html#review432223128", "text": "I stay at the Ramada often.
