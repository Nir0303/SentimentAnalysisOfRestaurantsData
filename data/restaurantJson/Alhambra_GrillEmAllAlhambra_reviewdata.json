Basically two grilled cheese sandwiches, one for each bun surrounding your basic burger.   It could not be finished, just to overwhelming with all that bread.  Someone else in our our party tried the Powerslave, which was a great combo of brie and apple compote around your burger.  Small but nice selection of beers on tap.  Located right next to a theater so there is plenty of free parking.  Lots of metal music playing.  Seating available outside.    Average price for a burger is $13.  Only the daily special includes fries, otherwise it is another $4 for fries..  Party of 3 was $70 for lunch including burgers, fries and beers.\nNothing fancy, but something fun to try.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-04-18T12:06:30-0400", "location_id": "4819655", "id": "266468463", "user": {"username": "jennifero55", "user_location": {"name": "Arvada, Colorado", "id": "29140"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Molly Hatchet is good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29078-d4819655-r263771840-m11068-Grill_Em_All_Alhambra-Alhambra_California.html#review263771840", "text": "I enjoyed the Molly Hatchet burger.  It is served with bacon, maple syrup, and fennel sausage gravy.  I thought it worked well.  It is only served on Monday.  The staff was friendly even though I look far from \"metal.\"  The metal atmosphere doesn't really suit my fancy but I liked the food.  The fries are properly double-fried and the serve them with complimentary garlic aioli.  They also have some other sauces one can use.  All-in-all, it's a pretty solid burger joint.  If you're not into the metal music blaring, you might want to consider take-out and even eat at one of the nearby tables in the complex it is located in.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-05T08:07:34-0400", "location_id": "4819655", "id": "263771840", "user": {"username": "ClevelandBeachBoy", "user_location": {"name": "Greater Cleveland", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Slow service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29078-d4819655-r256199517-m11068-Grill_Em_All_Alhambra-Alhambra_California.html#review256199517", "text": "We came after they issued a Groupon, it took 35 minutes to receive our 2 burgers!
