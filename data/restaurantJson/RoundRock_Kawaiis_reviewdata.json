The ice is perfect and smooth, and they even do a stuffed snoball (ice cream in the middle). I recommend you get that -  I think they call in the Kawaii special. The place consists of two windows where you walk up and order, (or  they have drive thru) with some tables and large umbrellas outside.  I love the ambiance - they have a shark bursting thru the front facade and misters to keep you comfortable if you eat there.  Perfect stop for a cold treat on a hot day, which there are plenty of here in TX.  Only recommendation is that you'll want to check the hours before you go - they sometimes close earlier than I expect for a spot serving dessert.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-07-16T11:51:32-0400", "location_id": "4214120", "id": "167829585", "user": {"username": "dot15409", "user_location": {"name": "Austin", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-05", "title": "A Little Piece of Hawaii Right Here in Round Rock!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56584-d4214120-r166466166-m11068-Kawaii_s-Round_Rock_Texas.html#review166466166", "text": "Taking a trip to Kawaii's has become one of our Sunday activities.
