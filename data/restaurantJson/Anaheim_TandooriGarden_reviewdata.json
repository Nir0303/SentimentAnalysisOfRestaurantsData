This is the best mango smoothie you\u2019ll ever have. It was ice cold, creamy, and packed full of mango flavor. Indian mango is very different than Hawaiian mango. It tasted more like a papaya. The color was a vibrant orange like pureed pumpkin. The rose water added a sweet, floral aroma and flavor to the drink. It was a nice touch! Thumbs up, way up!\n\nGarlic Naan is garnished with freshly chopped garlic, coriander leaves, and baked in a clay oven. Slightly crispy outside, yet chewy, it was baked just right. It had an excellent garlic flavor. The coriander leaves were a fresh and flavorful touch. Thumbs up, way up!\n\nFull order of Chicken Tandoori is quartered pieces of young succulent chicken that has been marinated overnight in their signature blend of herbs and spices. The cooks at Tandoori Gardens have learned the art of tandoori very well. This has to be the best tandoori chicken I\u2019ve ever had. The pieces were fall-off-the-bone juicy, even the white meat. The tandoori locked in the flavor and made it juicy and tender, almost like broasted chicken but without the oil. The marinade was subtle but brought out the essence of the chicken. Thumbs up, way up!\n\nChicken Tikka Masala is boneless chicken cooked in a Tandoor and prepared in a yogurt butter cream sauce. Wow! The chicken absorbed the spices in the sauce which was creamy and light. It looks heavy, but you\u2019ll definitely love it. The sauce reminded me of chipotle cream sauce without the heat. Order a side of basmati rice or naan so you can sop up the sauce. You don\u2019t want to waste a drop as the sauce makes this dish extraordinary. Thumbs up, way up!\n\nLamb Saag is boneless pieces of tender lamb, cooked in spinach and blended with their signature herbs and spices. This dish is one of my all-time favorites in Indian cuisine and Tandoori Garden makes a really great one. The lamb was so tender like the perfect beef stew, almost melts in your mouth. The spinach was cooked down and with the juices from the lamb and spices and made a lovely gravy-like sauce. Use your naan to scoop it up as you don\u2019t want to waste a drop of this one either.
