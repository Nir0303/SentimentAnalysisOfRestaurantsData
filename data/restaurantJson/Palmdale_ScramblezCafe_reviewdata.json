We just love going to breakfast after Sunday church at this small cafe.  There are only about nine booth lining the sides of this small cafe with a bar containing four stools and three tables in the center between the rows of booths.\n\nYes, the place is small, but always crowded.  Even so, the longest we ever had to wait for a free table/booth was about ten minutes.\n\nThe staff is very, very friendly - the food is excellent - the chef is very accommodating - and the prices are excellent, giving a great bargain for what you get.\n\nThere are two other locations in town, both of which we have patronized.  The location in Palmdale is of similar size to the location in Quartz Hill.  It is next to the Palmdale city library.  The ambiance is not quite as charming as the Quartz Hill location, but everything else holds, quality of food, friendliness of staff, prices, etc.\n\nThe location in Lancaster, in the Stater Brothers shopping center is much larger, and we really don't enjoy eating there.  Everything is the same quality, but being so large, it is difficult to develop a relationship with the waitresses.  Just too impersonal.  The times we ate there, we always had a different waitresses.  No opportunity to build a friendship.\n\nWe love Scramblez and eat there often.  All cafes should be as wonderful.
