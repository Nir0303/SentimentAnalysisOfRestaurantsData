Since it was a celebration for my beautiful wife, Sharon, we indulged in an number of delectables. First off, if you like Bourbons take advance of the extension list. Our waiter helped us select two bourbons that Sharon and I both enjoyed. The next complementary disk was duck field frites or fries. Cooked with 3 different and enjoyable spices with accompanying delicious sauces. Very good. Next we ordered the entrees with my wife opting for the petite filet topped with foie gras. Delicious. I opted for the big filet and it was perfectly cooked to medium rare. Almost tender enough to cut with a fork and I would rank it in the top 4 filets I've enjoyed at similar restaurants. Side for my son  and I include the Micheal Mina signature truffle mac n chess. This is truly a winner and you must try it if you like mac n cheese . The other was a glazed Brussels sprouts which were also very good. I also want to state that they have a n extensive wine list and quite a few by the glass. I had a Napa Zin that paired nicely with the filet, and Sharon opted for a Cab. Both good. We finished with lattes that were a nice touch. By the way, use the valet service. The Steak validates up to 3 hours and you text them when you finish so the wait time is minimal. They also have various wagu from Japan, Australia, and the US. I tasted my sons, US wagu, and I prefer the filet.. If you love good steak, you need to try the Steak.

Bourbon Steak always offers a good experience. Great food and great service. I had my usual bone-in Ribeye. It was so good, it almost brought tears to my eyes. Chrissy and Richard both ordered the petite filet and raved.  The flavor just bursts from the steaks served here.

The food was not great but good, some dishes more tasty than others. The appetizers were a mixed bag, the beef  and basic fishes were good, the desserts tasty. All in it's worth a return visit.
