It is located in a shabby building with shabby decor.  Forget shabby because the food is exceptional.  Greek pizzas are loaded with cheese and meat.  Pizzas are not cut into pie wedges but rather as little squares.  The Greek salad has a wonderful lemon dressing rather than vinegar, loaded with feta and the lettuce is crisp and cold.  A small salad can feed two.  The gyro is authentic in flavor, spices and texture--not the thin sliced commercial pet-food-like gyro meat you find elsewhere.  If you are in a hurry, you might order other menu items because the authentic Greek fare is pretty much made from scratch and takes extra time.  The families that own Tony's seem to rotate between Missouri and Greece.  Many of the guys preparing the food have been there for decades.  The table service is cheerful.  Don't wait for your check, go to the cash register and they will figure it up.  My favorite is the gyro dinner with great bread, lots of meat, onions, tomatoes, tzatziki sauce and fries that taste like they are real and not frozen.  The shishkabob is also excellent with cubes of pork.
