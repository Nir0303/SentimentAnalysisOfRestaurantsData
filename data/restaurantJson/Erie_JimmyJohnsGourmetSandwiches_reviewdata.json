I'm currently working in Erie, PA, and decided to order a Jimmy John's sandwich and have it delivered to the hotel.  I ordered the Gargantuan sandwich, and when it didn't arrive in 30 minutes, I called the store.  The manager told me they were a bit behind.  When my sandwich finally arrived, it was a tuna sandwich.  I called the store, and the manager promised the right sandwich shortly.  When the sandwich arrived it was incorrect.  Again, I called the store, and was promised a corrected sandwich,  I decided to contact the store again to make sure they made the sandwich correctly, but the man that answered the phone was so rude, that I just cancelled my order.  I know this is not normal behavior for a Jimmy John's restaurant, so in my opinion, this restaurant does not deserve the name Jimmy John's.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-07-03T12:28:56-0400", "location_id": "8396396", "id": "285365877", "user": {"username": "ronhansard", "user_location": {"name": "Clinton, Kentucky", "id": "39284"}}}]}
