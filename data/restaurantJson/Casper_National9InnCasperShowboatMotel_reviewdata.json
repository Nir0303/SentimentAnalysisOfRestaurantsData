Still, I can't in my good conscious recommend this hotel. It's not very clean, the carpets are stained and look like they need vacuumed, the bedding looks like someone fell asleep with a cigarette in his or hand and was burned, and the AC unit was boarded up. On top of it all, it wasn't pleasant to have the police raid the room across from you at 3 in the morning because someone tried to murder the other. No wonder my dog was on edge all night. I will give that the staff is nice and accommodating, but in all honesty, there is now way I would stay here again. It just doesn't seem like a good neighborhood all together. I didn't feel safe and I was checking on my car throughout the night. My advice is to really weigh your pros and cons and see if you can budget for a different hotel.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "National9inns, Manager at National 9 Inn Casper Showboat Motel, responded to this review", "text": "Dear LillyEmber,\nWe apologize for the bad experience you had with us.

It was a nice stay. Very reasonable price 59.95 for one night. Very Friendly Front desk staff. Told me about a place called poor boys, and the fort for a steak dinner. My wife and I wanted a smoking room, and unfortunately it had to be on the second floor, but climbing the stairs was better than standing in the wind. We stayed in room 201. The bed was very comfortable, and it was away from the highway which i figure can be noisy like most that are right along side them. The shower was very nice, didn't have to wait more than a minute for it to warm up. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through town. The only Change i would recommend would be putting smoking rooms on the ground floor for the elderly and bigger people that have trouble with stairs.

This place is close to the freeway so you do pick up some road noise but for me I sleep with the AC fan on and it pretty much drowns out all the outside noises.  The breakfast int he morning is served in the lobby that consists of waffles, bagels, danishes etc.  There is limited space to sit in the lobby so we just grabbed a bowl of cereal and coffee and went back to our room.
