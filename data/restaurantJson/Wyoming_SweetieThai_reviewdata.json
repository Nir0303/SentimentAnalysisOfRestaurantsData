Always looking to try something different, Sweetie Thai was chosen and we weren't disappointed. My wife had the vegetarian Curry Pad Thai, my daughter had the chicken Pad See Ew, and I ordered the Sweetie Thai Pork. Each entree was surprisingly deliciously seasoned to taste. Even more surprising was the generous servings: it is very rare that I can't finish an entree. It was great having a chance to again savor the meal from earlier that afternoon. If you really like spicy food,  I'd suggest you begin at level 3/5 and advance or retreat from there. I had a chance to\ntaste my daughter's Mango and Sticky Rice, which was also delicious and, (in my view), a great Thai version of rice pudding.
