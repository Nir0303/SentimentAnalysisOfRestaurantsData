Oh yeah, it was worth it!  I have so much to say about this place and it only has about 8 things on the menu!\n\nKewpee's was very busy at 12:30 and we sat at a table that had just been vacated.  A waitress came and cleaned it in short order.  We were at a six top and ended up sharing it with another couple about half way through our meal...that seems to be how it works here.  Though not from Racine, we felt very much like we were part of the Kewpee family from the moment we entered.  Had a great chat with a 90 year old WWII vet who stopped by our table!  I also was reminded of a favorite cafe from childhood...this place had such a great vibe and I would highly recommend it!!\n\nThere is table seating and counter seating.  There is a whole wall of Kewpie dolls behind glass.  There is only the menu on the wall.  They have some breakfast items, burgers, chicken, fish, and toasted cheese sandwiches.  Fries and some other sides.  We had cheese burgers and split a toasted cheese--really yummy!  The root beer is amazing and you get free refills!!  The shakes looked amazing, too!  The wait staff is beyond nice and efficient.  The prices are super reasonable!  The owner was on the grill.  They have $13 t-shirts for heaves sake!
