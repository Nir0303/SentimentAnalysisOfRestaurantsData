Boring!  try entertaining your audience that's out to have a good time and party and dance and laugh instead of over-mixing this that and the other thing and just making the whole vibe generally all chopped up and all about the DJ him.....\n\nAlso, totally not a big deal, but after a certain hour, they have a bathroom attendant, which takes up alot of space in the not so huge ladies room and I also wind up feeling terrible if I happen to not have cash with me.
