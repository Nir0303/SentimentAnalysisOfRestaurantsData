Ortegas is one of the survivors and they are worth a visit.\nThe signage says Diner and Restaurant and may be off-putting but stroll on in anyway. The staff are all family and extremely friendly and are truly happy to see you and invite you into their establishment.\nFrom the outside you could be fooled into thinking that it serves Mexican cuisine but the owners are Guatemalan and the food is as authentic as you can get outside of Villa Nueva.\nSince they are within walking distance of the business district, the menu shows breakfast options as well as lunch and dinner choices. We went for the evening's special which was a chicken and vegetable platter, very much like a stew; it also could be served with shrimp if that was your liking.\nThe Tamales are classic Guatemalan, rich and satisfying and nothing like their Mexican cousins to the north. They are vegetable or chicken and are moist and flavorful. Along those lines, the Fajitas are spiced for the Guatemalan  taste and are subtle but fascinating at the same time.\nEverything is hand made, on the premises and one of the examples of the care taken in preparation is the tortillas. They are a hybrid, both corn and flour, hand thrown and shaped. Not at all like the thin commercial tortillas that are served in other restaurants or sold in the stores; these are thicker and have a wonderful bread-like texture that stands up to the food or eaten plain, they are that flavorful. I had trouble keeping my family out of my stash, you'll want to order an extra helping if you have that problem as well.\nOrtega's is a relatively new place and are absolutely worth your consideration and a visit.
