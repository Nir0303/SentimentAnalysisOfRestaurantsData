The building itself is one of the older ones left and it was for many years a furniture store. It has a creaky but dependable elevator which can take you up to the spooky third floor where you can explore to your hearts content all the larger old furniture items that gather dust of the ages. This place is loaded with aisles of books/postcards/art - they have statuary, taxidermy and everything in between. Many items are obviously left overs from huge estates. I have found many smaller items that still grace our home - just unusual little things such as gorgeous little clocks, ivory-toned pictures and interesting metal birds that are so realistic. They have collections from WWII, jewelry, coins and all the bric-a-brac you need to set up your mid-century memory room. This is a place you will likely not want to bring your children along to enjoy - there's just too much \"stuff\" and it's overwhelming enough for adults. Plus, who wants to pay for broken Limoges?
