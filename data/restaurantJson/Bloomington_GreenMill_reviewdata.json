We sat in bar and had to listen to some very loud patrons discussing philosophy but they finally left so we had some quiet.  If you want a quiet dinner or snack I would suggest staying out of the bar.  Also there were several TVs with sports on so depending on the event it could lively in the bar or annoying if you are not into that.  Looks like lots of people order their pizza.  Also ate here for breakfast and they gave me a take out tray so I loaded up an took it to my room.  Bacon was cooked well done which was very good, scrambled eggs had a little cheese on them and were cooked well and the muffins tasted fresh.

We are sorry that our Brunch didn't meet your expectations.  We normally get great comments on our Sunday brunch and have quite a few regulars because of it, but clearly we dropped the ball during your visit.  I can assure you that everything on our buffet was made that day as we don't use leftovers.  We do have several types of muffins that would be a better fit than a sugary pastry as well as offering toast, or a bagel on request.  Your comments, while disappointing, will only make us better in the future.

Had we known the 12 people around the bar were going to be obliterated, obnoxious and extremely inappropriate, we would have gone some where else.  Adults, who seemed to be 50+ were hammered and EXTReMELY loud.   The bartender called them by name, taking a selfie with one guy behind the bar, flicking off the photo.  I understand we chose to sit at a bar, but did not expect this type of crowd at this time nor at Green Mill.  It's the last time we go here again.  Our waiter was fantastic.  We felt bad for him constantly having to maneuver around the people who had too much to drink.  Another guy was sitting on top of the bar being obnoxious.  The bartender enabled the behavior.
