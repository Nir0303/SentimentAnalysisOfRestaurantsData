I have never tried anything else they make but we watch a lot of people walk out with pizza boxes so it must be decent too.

I always order more sauce and half the time they forget to give it to you which isn't a problem when you eat in but makes me crazy when you do takeout .I have had better pita bread too but I'm so happy with the meat filling I let that go.

Well, they surely do! \n\nI got a small cheese pizza, and a piece of their housemade spinach pita. The pita could've been a little bit warmer, but it was very good .. would definitely get it again!\n\nMy husband got a bacon cheeseburger club, and he had asked for cooked mushrooms on it. It came with cooked onions instead of mushrooms, so he notified the counter .. and instead of just scraping the onions off and re-topping it with mushrooms, like most places would've done, they re-made the whole thing! Way to go you guys ... now that's proper service! ! His sandwich even came WITH fries .. which is unheard of nowadays! \n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted at the counter by a very knowledgeable and welcoming gentleman who made us feel like we've been coming there for years. Well, I can certainly see us GOING there for years. Great food, great employees, and FANTASTIC prices! \n\nDefinitely go and enjoy this place .. there are a few tables inside if you want to eat there, and they also do delivery .. as well as obviously take-out.
