The shrimp is plentiful and comes with boiled egg, beans, beets, the whole shabang.  This place also has a direct line into what ever factory turns out perfect serving staff.  These are mainly young people who are uniformly friendly, caring, polite, light-hearted, and just plain charming.  They even have trivial pursuit cards on the tables to keep one occupied while the food is cooked.  My wife and I had dinner there the other night for under $20.  Ok, so there's no wine or beer.
