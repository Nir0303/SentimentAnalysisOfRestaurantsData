I noticed there were reservations available on open table for 8:00, 8:15, 8:30, 8:45 and on and on so we decided to take a chance and not make a reservation. No big deal if we can't get in. When we arrived we asked the host if there was anything available, he glanced at a book and said only at the bar. We were cool with that.\nSo the door was opened and we were not \"led\" by the host, but rather had the door shut right behind us as we slipped through, weird, but we get it.....\nSo, we walked downstairs and hit up the bar. The ambiance is really cool. A nice dark bar area made to resemble an old speak easy. We're feeling it. \nWe take a seat at the bar. A young gentleman hands us menus right away and we begin to decide.... After one bartender explains that he will be leaving he lets us know that someone else will be right with us. Ok cool. We look around and notice there is only one table with guests at it and all the others are empty. After about 10 minutes our drink order is taken and we casually ask if we are able to sit at a little coffee table to order dinner or are they reserved...\"you have to ask the host, I have no idea\". Fair enough.  We get our drinks and my husband heads back upstairs to ask the host about a table. He is now a she and she tells him she doesn't know, ask the bartender downstairs.....ok the run around. So, we will eat at the bar, no big deal, we are very much bar people. \nWe decide on 2 starters and 2 main dishes....... We wait. We try to get one of the 5 employees attention so we can order, we are so hungry. We close our menus and look ready......nothing. We try to make eye contact, but we are ignored. We start to question things.... Are we not hipster enough? Do we look awkward? What's the deal? We finish our drinks.....we wait. What is going on? There were more employees at the end of the bar then there were patrons in the restaurant....NO JOKE! We even walked to the back library to see if maybe they were busy in another area of the restaurant and we just weren't seeing it...nope! \nour total time spent at Rest was an hour. ONE HOUR for a beer and a martini. The most expensive item in a bar or restaurant is an empty seat guys and you had plenty. Our bill was $20, with any kind of service it would have been over $100 after we ordered food and drinks, but we were never given the opportunity. A note to the owner, teach your staff about taking care of the guest. The service was non existent. And your tables were empty. We left hungry and confused. Went to Eva's.....had an awesome time as usual. We will not be recommending Rest to anyone we know.

Since I am originally from NYC, and have that inherent chauvinistic NYC attitude inherent to all New Yorkers, I wasn't surprised that both the owner and manager are from the Big Apple.  They brought that New York savvy to SLC and have the city's best bar and one of its best restaurants.  \nA locked door located in the back of the nondescript Bodega reveals a staircase taking you downstairs to a trendy, hipster decorated room that has just the right amount of panache.  With a staff that is warm and accommodating, I wasn't surprised that the Pimm's Cup my spouse ordered was just superbly crafted, and my rum was premium.

Make sure you get reservations prior to your visit to the rest. Attire is dressy casual and the atmosphere is electric - it's a really fun space! They have a backroom that they use for larger groups - it would be perfect for a birthday celebration dinner.\n\nThe drinks are superb in both the Bodega and the Rest - the bartenders really know their craft here and can concoct specialty drinks for you. If you're trying out the Rest for your first time, try out one of the Absinthe fountains for a fun experience. The food is awesome - we went for a late night meal, so we just got apps : ceviche, Scottish duck, and the chicken wings.

We had to wait until 5 when Bodega opened, once we walked in there was a little \"hipster\" douche talking on his cell phone. He didn't appreciate our enthusiasm to visit \"The rest\". Once we trekked our luggage downstairs we approached a dimly lit long bar with old timey seating and by far the best atmosphere I have ever encountered. The barista Zade is one of the most memorable people i have ever met and would go back in a heartbeat just to visit him. The cocktails are phenomenal and the food is just as good. We had various drinks and food off the menu, everything was wonderful. My boyfriend said that the old fashioned was probably the best one he's ever had. From the record player to the decor I loved every minute of visiting this place and am so glad we did not miss it!\n\nI would recommend making reservations.

What a great meal.  Comfort food satisfying that basic need, and elevated to titillate gastronomic sensibilities.

First tell the server that you are in the mood for something effervescent that packs a punch and see what the bartender delivers.  That was fun.  Then relax and order most anything on the menu (except the pickled onion rings-not to my taste, but hey...) and be prepared to be surprised and very pleased.
