Even the kiwi was so hard it couldn't be eaten.    When it came time to leave, about 15 minutes after arrival I went to the desk and advised that I was not paying for that horrible food.

Most leave you disappointed and wishing you'd gone somewhere else.  However, I was very pleased with Buffet Palace. It was around 5:30p on a Sunday when we arrived and throughout our dinner they restocked the buffet. There was never an empty or overly heated dish.  They have a large variety of selections to choose from, including the sushi bar.  My only complaint was the Hot and Sour soup being too thick, which seems to happen at most buffets.

They offer Mongolian Grill, and Sushi, as well as a very large buffet.  Prices are average for today's economy, and of course on Friday and Saturday nights you pay a bit more (Approximately $11. 39 for adults) with all of the seafood choices added to the menu.  Last night they had several selections of Prawns, Frog Legs, Salmon, Crawdads, and clams on the half shell. They have lots of varieties to choose from, like 5 different soups, I just can't bring myself to choose something besides Egg-drop.  They have several hot bars, and a great selection of fresh fruits and salads, and then the normal sweet treats and ice cream.  As always our waitress last night was wonderful, she was great at keeping the glasses full, and the table cleared of dirty dishes.  My son gets the Mongolian Grill every time, he is partial to this when ever we go out to dine for Chinese, he say's that theirs is very tasty.  Why wouldn't it be, you design it any way you want it to suit your taste buds.  The man in my life is partial to their salmon with a sauce on top, and I myself like the Coconut Shrimp dish.  Fresh food is brought out and added to the bar constantly.  They serve different things from lunch and dinner, but I did request Egg Foo Young one night, and they were happy to oblige.  That is only on the lunch menu apparently.  Over all this is a great place to dine.  I have been there with our granddaughters, just the two of us, or with adult friends and family.  Every one always seem to have a good time and enjoy their meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-03-09T10:55:21-0400", "location_id": "5084917", "id": "196765626", "user": {"username": "Mrs W", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Worth, Texas", "id": "55857"}}}]}
