Their products are only marginal at best compared to other Great Harvest locations!! Great Harvest are Franchises and are individually owned and operated! It is unfortunate that the quality of the bakery goods and cleanliness aren't checked by the Franchisor!! With as much disease that is so prevalent out in the world one can not be to careful anymore!! \n\nHere is something to think about!! How much would you appreciate it if the salesgirls told you were a interruption to their work??? The salesgirls  told an older couple that came in for a sandwich that they were closed! They advertise they close at 6PM and it was 5:45 when they told the couple they were closed!! They electrical open sign was lite when the couple came in.  I left mad and the girls knew it! As soon as left  they locked the door behind me!! As I was walking back to my car two other customers wanted in but were told they were closed!!!\n\nI tried to tell Kathy one of the owners what had happened and she went ballistic on me!! She told me that the girls told her I asked them if they were religious in which I had, at first they seemed so nice but when I asked for another bread is when they told me I was interrupting then and they become rude!!\n\nWell needless to say I will never go back and encouraged all my friends and family never to shop with them ever!! In fact my wife, daughter in law and several of her friends were out shopping for Christmas when they wanted to take in lunch. One of the suggestions were to go to Great Harvest for sandwiches but my wife told them my story and they all decided never to go there again!!
