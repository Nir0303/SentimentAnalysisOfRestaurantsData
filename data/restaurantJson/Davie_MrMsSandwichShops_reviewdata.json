It is still owned and operated by them and proudly going on it\u2019s 30th year in business. Mr. M\u2019s is frequented by customers who originally came to eat with their parents and are now parents themselves. There are customers who have left the area for years and come back to visit, come in to the restaurant and are amazed to find everything the same and even more amazed that the food is still top quality and delicious. It has often been noted that Mr. M\u2019s Sandwich Shop has become a landmark in the Dania Beach/Hollywood area. At Mr. M\u2019s they take pride in their service to the customers, the quality of the food, the cleanliness of the establishment and their friendliness. In these times of many restaurants opening and closing they take their long standing in their location as a message that they are doing things right. That is why it is so important to everyone who works there to pay attention to even the smallest details, so they can maintain their success.\n\nOf course no successful business or owner does it on their own. Janet, Willie, and Paul (Dennis & Ginny\u2019s Son) have been a part of Mr. M\u2019s for many years and share in the commitment you need to operate any business successfully, especially a restaurant in business for 30 years. Dennis and Ginny and the Mr. M\u2019s family will never take any customer for granted or serve any food that is not top quality.\n\nThey ask us to please come in and try us! They promise you that  you will never taste fresher soups, salads and sandwiches and willl be back for another taste!\n\nAll this being said, the prices are a bit high for a sandwich, but they are HUGE, tasty and delicious. The customer service is awesome, and they really do have a great menu, staff and the food is incredibly fresh. They offer all sorts of deals on multiple purchases (lunch specials), and they cater to all types of food requirements. They easily accommodated a relative with special dietary considerations (vegetarian) and even changed out their gloves/utensils when cooking for her! All in all, its a great place to try.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-26T19:00:58-0400", "location_id": "6678079", "id": "262001495", "user": {"username": "legaltraveller", "user_location": {"name": "Miami, FL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "good sandwich", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34170-d6678079-r253260286-m11068-Mr_M_s_Sandwich_Shops-Davie_Broward_County_Florida.html#review253260286", "text": "Sandwiches tasty and a little pricy.
