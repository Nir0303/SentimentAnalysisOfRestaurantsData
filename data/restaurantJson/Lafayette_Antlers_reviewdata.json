Our second was terrible, even by Broussard/Youngsville standards. It was not worth the money you will spend. \n\nI ordered the crawfish etoufee, he ordered the eggplant Louisiane. I knew we were in trouble when our entrees came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered. (Pre-cooked, reheated.) My etoufee was lukewarm (at best) with Uncle Ben's minute rice plunked in the center and less than 10 crawfish in the sauce itself (I counted, it was all I ate). That wasn't even the bad part - it was sweet, like high fructose corn syrup sweet. Really awful and completely not worth the $21 charge. I ordered the brussel sprouts as a side (with an up-charge over the potato salad) and they were so oily, if I'd had a paper napkin, I would have attempted to soak up some of before I ate them. Overly salted, very little flavor, clearly cooked earlier, then reheated. \n\nHis eggplant Louisiane is a typical dish around here, done so much better at other restaurants. Ironically, it was all salt with very little sweet; some sherry would have improved it, albeit marginally. \n\nWe closed out the evening with all our entrees 25% consumed. I thought maybe, well, we came to a \"steakhouse\" and didn't order steak, but we ran into some friends on our way out, who sent their steaks back twice and also didn't finish most of their food. Such a shame. \n\nThe worst part is that we really want more restaurants on the Broussard end of Youngsville (or the Youngsville end of Broussard) to succeed. HookedUp is a total disaster, Romacelli's is a joke; there just seems to be a curse on restaurants that open up here. Notwithstanding, Antlers didn't even seem to be trying.
