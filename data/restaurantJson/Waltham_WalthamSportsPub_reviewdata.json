There is parking right next to the pub and all over the area. The pub is clean, has a nice juke box, the bar staff is very friendly, young and attentive.\nThere is no great selection of food items but this is not a place to go for dinning. Drinks are so reasonably priced, the crowd is mostly nice and not loud. They also have a couple of flat screen TVs if you feel like watching a game and even play Keno.\nIt is a quiet bar and even with music on the background you can still have a conversation. Great place to check out.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-01-09T06:34:40-0500", "location_id": "918201", "id": "149261204", "user": {"username": "A K", "user_location": {"name": "Watertown, Massachusetts", "id": "41887"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": null, "title": "Cheap food.
