Looking on the website the rate was $57.  The owner of the hotel quoted me a higher rate at the front desk.  Once I explain the online rate she offered me only a $60 rate.  Arrived in room and it was very old 1960s or 70s look.  Went to get on the Internet to do all of my paperwork,  and from the desk in room I kept losing Internet connection.  I literally had to stand out in the parking lot to get any Internet.  Then I went to clean up and noticed some man's whiskers all over the back of the sink behind the faucet.  In the bathroom there was a dead bug on the floor.  And once I turned my lamp on over the desk it was so covered with dust that it was even hanging from it.  Too late to check out I went to dinner.  Came back to turn on the TV and the remote did not work. \n Had to turn the TV on at the TV point was able to change channels but not adjust the volume.  So laying in bed trying to relax was very difficult due to having to get up and change the volume constantly depending on the channel.  Call the front desk owner came down tried new remote that did not work.  Said she would try a new remote.  I waited 25 minutes for her return,  that's never happened called back to the front desk.  She said that she would only come back if she could find one.  And was not able to.  Did not sleep well because I couldn't wait to check out.  When I did check out in the morning I showed the pictures to her husband the other owner.  And he had nothing to say except I will have to bring that up to housekeeping.  No apologies no discounted rate no nothing.  I am now 1/2 mile away spending the same amount of money in a suites Hotel which offers pool hot tub sauna free hot breakfast  and the staff is amazing.  How this hotel stays in business I have no clue.  It feels  like the type of hotel you should rent by the hour !!!!!!!  If you're thinking of getting a discount on a hotel at a cheaper rate you can find many others in the Boise area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-10-27T17:13:13-0400", "location_id": "248290", "id": "432276672", "user": {"username": "Brent S", "user_location": {"name": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "id": "60097"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "One night stand", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35394-d248290-r430622045-m11068-Cabana_Inn-Boise_Idaho.html#review430622045", "text": "If not for the low cost, this place wouldn't be a good choice.

It was $59.95 for a bare bones room. It had a big bed, fridge, microwave, wifi and non-HD TV. If you are a phobic about cleanliness then keep looking and expect to pay more. If you just need a place to rest, shower, and are into walking the city try them. There are places close for drinkable coffee, breakfast, and entertainment. Some people look for the lowest price and then complain when the place is not 4 star, so just want you to know--I'm cheap.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-16T16:22:34-0400", "location_id": "248290", "id": "311141435", "user": {"username": "Ricky_Dee49", "user_location": {"name": "Portland, Oregon", "id": "52024"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "A Pleasant Night's Rest", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35394-d248290-r309926335-m11068-Cabana_Inn-Boise_Idaho.html#review309926335", "text": "I chose the Cabana Inn because I was budget minded.  If you are traveling across the country, all sorts of \"doo-dads\" and accoutrements are a waste of money, in my opinion.  I want a comfy bed, a good shower, and outlets for recharging by toys (cell phone, digital camera, laptop, etc.).  It may be an older hotel/motel, but it accomplished my goals pleasantly.  I had a good night's sleep, got cleaned up, got my toys recharged, and was off for Oregon the next morning.  \n\nAs good as it all was, it must be noted that construction in downtown Boise and one-way streets made finding the Cabana Inn a bit challenging.  Also, the extra mileage to leave I-84 and drive into downtown Boise was a detraction.  Finally, there was no continental breakfast.  (But with the money I saved, a cheap & quick \"fast food\" breakfast kept the night economical.)\n\nThe folks at the front desk were friendly, too, so my overall experience was fine and comfortable.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-13T11:55:44-0400", "location_id": "248290", "id": "309926335", "user": {"username": "ColoradoJAK", "user_location": {"name": "Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Seen better days", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35394-d248290-r307931275-m11068-Cabana_Inn-Boise_Idaho.html#review307931275", "text": "This property is honestly a bit run-down and rough around the edges.
