It has a gorgeous selection of fresh foods, meats (butcher on site), local favorites, Michigan-made products, craft beers, wines, etc. It is more expensive than your average grocery store, and I wouldn't want to have to feed my family of five from there every day, but it is a beautiful store and we often splurge on some unusual fare. \n\nThe cafe serves fresh, healthy soups, salads, and sandwiches as well as breakfast selections. My favorite thing happens during the summer on Friday \"Patio\" nights. Weather permitting, the huge glass doors on the side of the building are opened up and there is live music, a full bar, and delicious dinner selections all while dining al fresco on the patio. (In case of inclement weather, the party moves inside) The crowd is always diverse and friendly. So nice to see some activity again in this once-bustling city. It is a family favorite for my guys.\n\nLafayette Market also offers catering and banquet space. \n\nTry it, you won't be disappointed!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-15T13:16:38-0400", "location_id": "7216646", "id": "222059716", "user": {"username": "Luv2TravelHistoricMI", "user_location": {"name": "Waterford, MI", "id": null}}}]}
