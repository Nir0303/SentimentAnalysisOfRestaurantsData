A New BBQ Champ has been Crowned !!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60377-d4132434-r434443222-m11068-Double_B_s_BBQ-West_Allis_Wisconsin.html#review434443222", "text": "Two caveats prior to anyone reading this review:  1)  In the interest of full disclosure, I neither seek nor accept anything of value or accommodation in return for any review I have or will write.  2)  I lived in and went to college in Texas, where BBQ is a religion, and if there is one thing I know and like it is BBQ.\n\nWith those caveats in mind, I meet with a former work colleague every month to 6 weeks and tonight was the night and \"Double B's BBQ\" in West Allis was the place.  The restaurant is located between the West Allis Post Office and what used to be the West Allis Hotel/Inn off 74th and Greenfield Avenue.  The building used to be \"Bunkers\" bar and had been a martini bar that served food.  Typical of most bars, the building is long and a bit narrow.  There is seating at the bar for around 12 patrons, and seating for around 42 diners.  Several tables were high tables, some were booth-type tables, and there were a couple of tables for 4.  The table tops looked like repurposed Texas style butcher block or barn wood.  The back bar was done nicely and I saw at least 24 different bottled beers on display above the liquor shelves.  My friend and I sat in the back of the restaurant and could see the work in the kitchen through an open space.  \n\nDouble B's is the only Milwaukee area BBQ place I have been in that has Lone Star beer (in bottles) available at $4.00 a bottle.  My friend had a bourbon old-fashioned.  We decided to have 2 starters.  Michelle, our server, told us that there was a limited quantity of burnt ends, so we ordered that, as well as \" Smoked Bacon Balls\" (Homemade hickory-smoked meatballs, wrapped in bacon and deep-fried, served with a small cup of Thai chili and Bleu Cheese).  The burnt ends had been pre-sauced in what tasted like Kansas City sauce and served over a small piece of toast.  Phenomenal !!  The burnt ends virtually had no fat whatsoever and were as pure a meat as I've ever had.  With BBQ being a religious experience in Texas, any good ol' boy will tell you that if meat has been smoked right, no sauce of any kind is needed.  I don't like sauce on my meat at all, as I want to have the smoky flavor as unadulterated as possible.  Despite the burnt ends being pre-sauced in preparation, they were quite good.  The smoked bacon balls are a meat lover's delight and 6 were served on 2 skewers.  (Note to Mr. Timber:  Add another skewer of these to the order and you'd have a great entree !).  \n\nMy friend and I decided that 2 starters wasn't enough food for us, so she ordered the Rib and Meat Platter (choice of brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, or burnt ends, with a half rack of baby back ribs) and Sweet Potato Fries as her side.  I ordered the Smoked Brisket with Mac & Cheese.  Each entree also came with Cole Slaw and Cornbread muffin.  My friend feasted on her burnt ends and ribs.  I was unable to tell if the pasta used for my mac and cheese was Cavatappi, Fusilli, or Rotini.  The mac and cheese was \"cheesy\" and a bit on the soupy side.  It was served warm, but was not hot.  The cole slaw was not very mayonnaise based like most.  It was cold and crunchy.  The star of the evening was the brisket.  The meats at \"Double B's\" are hickory smoked, a preparation/process very difficult to find in the greater Milwaukee area.  Hickory is considered more of a Kansas City style, but a lot of hickory is used in Texas, as well as mesquite, pecan, or oak wood.  Hickory adds a deeper smoky taste to the meat and it enhances the taste of the meat rather than overpowering it.  If I had to estimate, I had between 6-8 ounces of brisket, sliced thin and stacked on its side.  There was very little fat in the meat and it had been exceptionally smoked.  I hasten to say it, but I am nearly 70 years old and have eaten BBQ almost everywhere it is made and I have never had as good of brisket as I had tonight.  \n\nMichelle brought us a 6-pack carton filled with different BBQ sauces along with ketchup and mustard.  There was a KC style sauce (molasses and tomato style sauce), Texas sauce (sweet and tangy), a more fiery pepper type sauce, and Carolina sauce (vinegar based).  Neither of us used the sauce.  The smoky flavor of my brisket was all I wanted to taste - undiluted.  Can't say enough about how great it was - very light bark on the edges, moist/juicy, and tender.  It was so great that I made a \"to-go\" order of baby back ribs and sides for my wife to have when I got home, or tomorrow (should it last that long........!).  \n\nService was efficient without being intrusive, and within 1/2 hour of our arrival, the restaurant was full and the bartender and other staff were bagging to-go orders while doing their other job duties.  Mark Timber, one of the owners and pitmaster, comes out of the kitchen to mingle and interact with the diners.  He took me out back of the restaurant, where there is patio dining in warmer weather, where the smoker is located.  An incredible operation.  Hickory wood is racked and the smoker can hold a lot of meat.  Double B's is smoking meat almost 24 hours a day and brisket is smoked 15 hours.  \n\nTotal bill for what amounted to 3 meals, 2 starters, 2 beers, and 2 bourbon old-fashioneds was around $96.00 excluding tip.  You get a good amount of food for the money (Another note to Mr. Timber: while your prices are great, you could easily be charging up to $3-4 extra per entree and it would still be a good value).  \n\nPROS: friendly and prompt service; incredibly good food at a more than reasonable price; down home Texas atmosphere.\n\nCONS: parking can be a bit dicey and I had to drive a bit to find a spot, especially around dinner time. \n\nUp to tonight, my favorite BBQ place was \"Atlas\" in Grafton (besides Franklin's in Austin !), but tonight I crowned a new champion.  I'll definitely be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-03T18:31:00-0400", "location_id": "4132434", "id": "434443222", "user": {"username": "Stu T", "user_location": {"name": "Delafield, Wisconsin", "id": "59822"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Yummy!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60377-d4132434-r434171255-m11068-Double_B_s_BBQ-West_Allis_Wisconsin.html#review434171255", "text": "Everything was so good.

I loved my burnt ends platter (it was a special), my husband had the beef brisket, it seemed ever so slightly dry, but easily remedied by a selection of their own sauces.  He should have had the slow smoked ham (also a special). Sides, often a let down at BBQ joints, were exceptional. I found the smoked navy beans especially good. Server was knowledgeable and friendly. I wished we had had time during our visit to the area to eat here again. Really great.

First impression walking in was, \"WOW, this place smells awesome!!!\"  It just smelled of awesome BBQ.  Sat at the bar, the bar staff were friendly, recommended a few things.  Unfortunately, they were out of the \"Bacon Balls\" which are supposed to be fantastic.  Ordered Thai Chili wings and Beer Cheese soup.  The wings were outstanding.  Perfect blend of sweet and spicy and you could definitely sense the smoky flavor from the kitchen.  The soup was good.  Not great, but I would not hesitate to get it again.  I had dinner earlier, so was not hungry for a full meal, but I'll bet it is out of this world.  With that said, I was a bit disappointed at a couple things.  First, a customer called and apparently did not get everything he ordered for takeout.  The guy at the bar immediately called to the kitchen to get that part of the order going.  At that point, the cook came out (he may have been the owner) and proceeded to go through every ticket from the night to find out where things went wrong \"with the process\".  He kept going on about how the process was not followed and he needs to find out who did it.  He was essentially berating the bar staff in front of everyone.  Suggestion...the customer is always right.  Get the customer taken care of and deal with the rest later...in private if you think someone else is at fault.  That was a real turn off and I felt bad for the guys behind the bar.  Second, there was a guy in there that seemed to have a bit much to drink and was going on and on  about his family problems for the entire bar area to hear, and even some of his run-ins with the law.  I got the impression the bar staff knew him as a regular.  They may have wanted to try to get him to quiet down on the f-bombs and stories.  Bar talk is one thing, but the dining area is directly open to the bar area.  If I had my kids there, I would have been pretty pissed.  For just me, it rubbed me the wrong way and it just seemed to be a reflection on the establishment...whether it was or not.  Guilty by association I guess.  I'd really really like to try those bacon balls and maybe some brisket, but those experiences will probably keep me from going back.  Shame, because the food is awesome.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-07-23T10:06:32-0400", "location_id": "4132434", "id": "395855632", "user": {"username": "Mike S", "user_location": {"name": "Kenosha, Wisconsin", "id": "60003"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "A real gem!

Once again Trip advisor comes through with another great spot with super tasty food and a great atmosphere.  This place isn't very big. Luckily, we arrived early, around 11:30 and easily found a parking spot on the street out front and got a table for 5 on a Friday.  By 11:50 all of the 15 or so tables were full as were the seats along the bar.  \n\nWhen I asked, our server said the brisket was the best item on the menu which was music to my ears. Two of us ordered that and it came out moist and meaty with a touch of cayenne in the bark and a wonderfully hickory smoke taste. My son had the half rack of ribs and he said they were among the best he has had.  The pulled pork looked super good too.  Each sandwich comes with choice of sides-we mostly ordered fries which were hot, crispy and delicious.\n\nAnother nice touch is their collection of house made BBQ sauces including KC style (sweet), Texas style (bold) and NC style (mustard/vinegar) - YUM!  I especially liked the Texas style on my brisket. I should have asked if they sell those to take home!\n\nWhen I asked about preparation, our server invited me to go out back and see the huge smoker loaded with sausages, beef and pork.  I spent about 10 minutes talking with the friendly pit master getting professional tips for my own. home BBQ efforts. Super nice guy and some great helpful suggestions.\n\nThis place is a real gem!  Stop in an try the brisket, you will be glad you did.\n\nHighly recommended.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-22T14:20:48-0400", "location_id": "4132434", "id": "395610309", "user": {"username": "JimRiesterer", "user_location": {"name": "Edina, Minnesota", "id": "43031"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Hit the spot", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60377-d4132434-r393738631-m11068-Double_B_s_BBQ-West_Allis_Wisconsin.html#review393738631", "text": "Spent all day at The Car Craft Summer Nationals and we were on our way to the midnight drag races at Great Lakes Drag away but had to find dinner.
