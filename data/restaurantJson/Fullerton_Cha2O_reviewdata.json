The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was amazing!!!! The servings are super small though for the price. Each creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was just a couple spoonfuls. We wanted to try the s'mores cake but were brought cheesecake instead. After several attempts to have this corrected we gave in and ate the cheesecakes which were average. Management wasn't interested that we didn't get what we ordered. It's a super busy place. People obviously like the food. There was quite a line to get in. But the service was lacing. Between that and the prices, I wouldn't return, at least not for dessert.

If you can't find a parking spot just outside this place, there is a parking garage about 150 yards east from this place. Just warning you that the parking garage smells like urine. I recommend trying to find parking on the street if you can't take the smell. \n\nOnce we got inside, we were able to be seated immediately. The service is okay here. We tend to flag down the waiter each time we needed something. We ordered popcorn chicken and steak & egg plate. As for drinks, I ordered black milk tea with boba. Everything tasted delicious and the steak was medium-well as I requested. \n\nThe music is loud here in the evenings. There is one large HDTV tuned to a movie but muted. I have to yell when I talk to someone across the table from me. The restrooms were maintained and clean.
