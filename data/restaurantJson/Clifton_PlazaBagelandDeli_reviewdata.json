These are easily the best bagels in town.  The place is clean.  Service is quick and friendly.  And the food is great.  I'm not really a bagel guy, but my favorites are:  their chicken cordon bleu and the BLT, both on the house made rolls.  Always great.\n\nThey are well worth the trip.

They have been in Clifton for decades and I've been enjoying their bagels for just as long.\n\nThis place has a rock/punk feel to it and it is totally laid back. There aren't any fancy decorations--just great bagels! The staff that works at Plaza Bagel is awesome. Super cool and super friendly. \n\nI believe their bagels are bigger than the competition in the area and definitely the tastiest. They are always so fresh and I think it is because people are always buying them up so fast. Plaza Bagels has a good variety of traditional bagels and even have a few non-traditional flavors.\n\nAnd their breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal! Bacon, egg and cheese on a plain bagel is to die for! They also have a ton of drinks to choose from in the different coolers and do make a decent cup of coffee. \n\nWhen people move out of Clifton and come back for a visit, one of the first places they go to is Plaza Bagel.\n\nTry their bagels once and you'll be hooked!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-20T07:03:16-0400", "location_id": "4984585", "id": "223170740", "user": {"username": "Frank R", "user_location": {"name": "Jersey Shore, New Jersey", "id": "659474"}}}]}
