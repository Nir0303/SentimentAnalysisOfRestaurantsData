It is a lot more convenient than the other pizza place that we frequent, so I was making a trial run and they failed miserably. I was told that my order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. I got there in 18 minutes, paid for it and was told that it would be another 10 minutes. Apparently they had a big order and instead of telling me that, when I called in, they just allowed me to come in thinking my order would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. Other problem is that it was 90 degrees outside and they didn't have any air conditioning. So not only wasn't my order ready when I got there but I also had the \"pleasure\" of waiting in a hot little waiting area for it. When I got it home, the garlic bread had not been sliced all the way through so we ended up getting it all over the place trying to pull it apart. The pizza was alright but not great. I will order Domino's before I would ever order from them again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-03-11T17:41:11-0500", "location_id": "872482", "id": "354683634", "user": {"username": "dknighto", "user_location": {"name": "Layton, Utah", "id": "57041"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Is this cardboard or pizza crust??", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57041-d872482-r326779825-m11068-Salt_City_Pizza_Co-Layton_Davis_County_Utah.html#review326779825", "text": "Only tried takeout. We had a peperroni, meat lovers and vegetarian pizza's. The dough, sauce, cheese and sausage were terrible. The worst pizza's I can remember. It's possible I've eaten worse, but I doubt it. At least there was bacon on the meat lovers. I usually prefer non franchise pizza and avoid Pizza Hut and so on. However, I would eat Dominoes before I eat Salt City Pizza again. My wife also did not like the pizza. I do want to give advice: Get higher quality ingredients and do something to make the dough less like cardboard.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-11-14T14:36:14-0500", "location_id": "872482", "id": "326779825", "user": {"username": "Doug G", "user_location": {"name": "Layton, Utah", "id": "57041"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57041-d872482-r304214527-m11068-Salt_City_Pizza_Co-Layton_Davis_County_Utah.html#review304214527", "text": "Its good pizza but a little expensive.
