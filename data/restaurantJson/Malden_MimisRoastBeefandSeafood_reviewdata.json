Being from Andover I live in Texas know and visit my sister in Malden when ever I can. Down here the only clams you can get are the strips. So the first thing I do when I go through her front door is to call Mimi's for a full clam plate, and a roast beaf sandwich for later. Usually it arrives in less then 30 minutes hot and ready to eat. I have never had any complains with there food or service. I am planning to visit in July and after riding the blue and orange line and get on bus 108 and walk through her back door she probably already called.
