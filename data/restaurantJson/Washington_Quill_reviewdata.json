We were not sure what we wanted to drink from the menu the first night - the bartender came over, asked if he could help and crafted us special made cocktails (slightly modified from the menu) based on our personal taste!  And he was spot on.  Service was fast, and efficient, and most importantly personal and courteous.  \n\nOn Saturday night, a world renowned Pianist came in, and was a great touch to an already amazing bar.  \n\nI plan to take my friends here in the very near future!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-08T05:09:13-0500", "location_id": "5571717", "id": "435588975", "user": {"username": "Terry B", "user_location": {"name": "Washington, District of Columbia, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Pricey but good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28970-d5571717-r432611556-m11068-Quill-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html#review432611556", "text": "This is not the place to go for happy hour specials or discounted drinks.
