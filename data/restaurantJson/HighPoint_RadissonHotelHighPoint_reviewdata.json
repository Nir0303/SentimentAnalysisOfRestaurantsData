IMO the hotel could have given us some warning that this type of convention was being held there, but then we would probably have moved our group.  Very surprising to see people in full head leather masks with devil horns in the lobby late in the evening.  The room was sufficient but dated.  Bed was comfortable, A/C worked for the most part.

I contacted the Radisson in High Point about group rates and was directed to Nikki. She said that she would set up a room block for my family, half king rooms and half doubles, at a reduced rate of $109. For myself, she would book one of their one bedroom suites which included a parlor for $163.  First, every family member that tried to book one of our rooms had trouble. Some were told that the rooms were not available, even right after we arranged for the room block. Some were not given the discount, others were told they could not have king beds even though we still had some in our block.  When my family started checking in things only got worse. Check in took forever. Some family members had to change rooms during the weekend because of overbooking. I had arranged to stay at the hotel the night before and the night of my wedding. When I checked in I was informed that my reservation was only for the parlor side of the suite, not the entire room, meaning NO BED! This was the night before my wedding. I will say that the front desk staff was very patient and nice, even when dealing with an over emotional bride to be and her mother. They were able to find me a king size room and I could move to the suite the next day once it was vacated and turned over. But then I found out that I would be charged the room rate of the king size room, because it was a business class room this a lot of money. They were able to reduce the rate by 50%, but by this time I was in tears, the night before my wedding.  The next day I had to decorate the venue, I made sure that my new room would be ready at 12:30 when I was due back, so that I had time to shower before hair and make-up. It was not. I was told I could go back to my original room to shower, so I go upstairs, but my luggage had already been removed. I went back to the front desk and was directed to suite where I had to wait in the parlor while housekeeping cleaned the bathroom so that I could shower.  The day after the wedding, my parents had arranged for us to host a farewell brunch in a meeting room. The hotel \"Catering\" was exactly what we had eaten in the breakfast buffet all weekend. While it was a very nice set up, I think this could have been taken up a notch.  I am still waiting on an almost $200 refund for not staying in the suite for a night, honestly the whole stay should have been comped as it was a complete nightmare!  I want to say again that all of the staff we dealt with in person was VERY helpful, understanding and informative.
