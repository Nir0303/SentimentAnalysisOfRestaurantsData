Great place!!! Great service... we sat at the bar and had a long vivid conversation with the owner... who shared a lot of info about Frederick and kept us wishing to stay!!!  Another place we surely will visit during our 'once a month' visit to Frederick!!!

If you get a wine card, you can sample several different wines before you commit- gives you an opportunity to sample some wines you have not had before without much risk. The smallest pours were really small- not much more than a sip. The deserts were really good- recommend the tiramasou and the parfaits. The cheesecake was good, but dense and very rich. The set up is a bit confusing- you can get a card from the front, or from a waiter, but overall a fun time.

I only drink white wine with food and prefer heavily oaked red wines.  I ended up not getting anything to drink.\n\nThe staff there can not answer basic questions about the wines  for example  approximately how long was the cab in oak? \n\nPretty much all the wines were lower end wines with almost no higher end wines.  Just before we got ready to leave, I flipped through the menu and noticed a few higher end wines - I guess they keep behind the bar and pour by the glass.  Some of these looked good.  When I asked, I was told they just changed the menu and they no longer had any of these except one which was unopened and she didn't seem interested in opening it.    \n\nOverall, they have a good lower end (not cheap - but like $10 - $20 per bottle) wine selection with several grape varieties most people probably have not tasted before.   This provides a nice opportunity to try different wines without purchasing the whole  bottle.  \n\nDid not try the food as we had a reservation at the Tasting Room for a special occasion.  I would hire or train the staff there to answer questions about the wine and also be able to recommend wines based on the grape varieties customers know they already enjoy.  Overall - not my kind of place but I think many others would enjoy it.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-27T06:09:09-0400", "location_id": "6656662", "id": "314001566", "user": {"username": "sharaty", "user_location": {"name": "Kenosha, WI", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Fantastic idea", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60903-d6656662-r308192648-m11068-Vini_Culture-Frederick_Maryland.html#review308192648", "text": "Great idea to be able to try different wines without having to buy a bottle.
