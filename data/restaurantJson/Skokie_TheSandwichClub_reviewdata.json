Located in one of the store fronts is The Sandwich Club.  The interior is nicely finished and will hold between 35 - 40 customers, though that might be tight.  The staff, especially David, was friendly.   You order at a counter and they bring you the food after examining the menu on the wall above the counter.  There are deli sandwiches and other types of sandwiches.  Several different soups - no sweet sour cabbage soup, though.  Most, if not all, of the sandwiches come with homemade potato chips.  The food was fresh and tasty.  We ordered a 3 taco platter and a tuna fish sandwich.  Both of us were happy with the taste.  This is a Kosher restaurant, so they are closed on Saturday.  The only slightly bad thing is the bathroom, as you do have to go through the kitchen to get to it.  But I can say the kitchen and bathroom were clean.   A bit more than some other places, but it was very fresh food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-13T17:36:34-0400", "location_id": "3314797", "id": "364023559", "user": {"username": "Allen21096", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}]}
