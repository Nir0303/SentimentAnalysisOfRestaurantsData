Fast forward to opening an independent.  Hooray, raise the flags, oh but it's really not that pleasant.  First of all, Waltham has a thousand artists, and the art on the walls at the cafe is Posters - nice photos but still.  Secondly, the place is way too loud - all hard materials and a very reverberant room.  I still go occasionally,  but generally only to take out.  Waltham still needs a good independent.  More than Words has a nice atmosphere, but not interesting food or coffee.
