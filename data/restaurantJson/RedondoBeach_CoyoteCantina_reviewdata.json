The sauce was very runny and there was an overabundance of it in regards to the other ingredients. It was still good, just not quite the same. Maybe their cook was having an off day, who knows. The waitress however was snotty. The type the doesn't smile, but when she does, you can tell it's fake. The type where you feel like an inconvenience. Maybe they're ALL having an off day.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-06-17T20:53:04-0400", "location_id": "361009", "id": "210864885", "user": {"username": "Renee C", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "One hit and a couple misses", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32954-d361009-r210603844-m11068-Coyote_Cantina-Redondo_Beach_California.html#review210603844", "text": "Our family eats a lot of Mexican food. A lot. We tried Coyote Cantina our first night in Redondo Beach as it was within walking distance from our hotel and had some excellent ratings on both Trip Advisor and Yelp. \n\nThe wife ordered blackened chicken enchiladas, two of us had burritos and our youngest had a chicken finger kids meal. The wifes was by far and away the best as the garlic creme sauce was a fantastic topper to the chicken enchiladas. Unfortunately, that was the one hit for the meal. I had a carne asade burrito and while it was as big as my head, the steak was rough and the bean/rice combo on the interior made for a bland tasting mess, especially compared to the wife's selection. Finally, the kids meal was two small chicken breasts on a plate -- not sure how you screw up a kids menu staple, but they did. Even with the largely average food, the worst part was our service. Multiple times we had to ask for drink refills, condiments, etc. Our waitress was disinterested and spent more time talking with a coworker by the bar then attending to our table. Maybe it was just a bad night for everyone, but for $70+ after tip for 3 entrees and a kids meal, I expected more.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-06-16T10:07:33-0400", "location_id": "361009", "id": "210603844", "user": {"username": "Svoboda1", "user_location": {"name": "Fishers, Indiana", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Makes You Sit Up and Take Notice of Tasty Yet Potent Drinks", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32954-d361009-r207669513-m11068-Coyote_Cantina-Redondo_Beach_California.html#review207669513", "text": "This is a happening locals place.
