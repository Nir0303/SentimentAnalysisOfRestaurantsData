After that, I relaxed and enjoyed the Peruvian ceviche (mixed seafood & onions marinated in citrus juice -- some claim original way -- has much bigger chunks than is usually served in North America) .\n\nSeveral mains were ordered to share, including Lomo Saltado which had just the right combination of meat/peppers/onions/seasonings/potato/rice.  The chicha morada was a tad too sweet (but I always thought it was too sweet!) but nicely flavored with cinnamon. \n\nCan't speak to the other dishes (tallerines and two kinds of bistek) because after anticuchos, ceviche, and lomo saltado I couldn't eat another bite!
