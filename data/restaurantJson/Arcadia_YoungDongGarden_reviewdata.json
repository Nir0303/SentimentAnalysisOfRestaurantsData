Dinner started well enough with an array of small dishes, kimchi, seaweed, bean sprouts, spicy pickled zucchini and slivers of tofu marinated in sesame oil. From there the meal went downhill quickly.  The meat in the japchae had been cooked earlier as it was cold.  The dish itself was bordering on bland. The bibimbap paled in comparison to those we've had in fast food joints.  On the plus side, the dishes are big enough to share for two big eaters or even a family of four.\nThe service is friendly and prompt.  The atmosphere is in need of sprucing up with a paint job and perhaps some artwork. Our bill for the two dishes and one soft drink was about $30.00 before tip.

I think it is because it was very hot that day, and that probably the air conditioning unit that covers the whole building was broken. \u2020he tables are stone, and each table has a button in which will signal a waiter/waitress.\n\nThe typical routine starts with a lettuce salad with a vinegar/sesame dressing, and then panchan, in which has kimchi, fish cakes, seaweed, and other dishes, as well as one vegeterian pancake with a dipping sauce.\n\nWe typically order a Combonation, in which is basically 2 dishes- one tofu and one meat course. It is a very good deal, and can save you a lot of money with big parties.  For this visit we got the beef and the beef ribs and both of them were good. The meat was juicy and tender and was very flavorful.\n\nTofu is good as well...they do provide a egg to cook inside. Nothing really special about it...just like your normal places, but you can also order non spicy too. \n\nTheir Kalbi noodle soup is also very good. The meat given is flavorful unlike your usual soup extras. In addition, the soup is flavorful with lots of the beef flavor. A very good dish- and great to serve with rice.\n\nSpeaking about rice they now use black rice mixed with white rice, in which makes purple colored rice. However the black rice gives the rice more chew, and we have never seen this happen in any other restaurant other than \"Red Ant Cafe\" in San Gabriel.\n\nAt the end of the meal they give out some melon gum, in which is also given out in many other Korean restaurants.\n\nOverall a pretty good restaurant!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-09-30T17:35:48-0400", "location_id": "1016688", "id": "20517853", "user": {"username": "BSA126", "user_location": {"name": "Arcadia, California", "id": "29105"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Waitress/owner follows customer out to cuss them out because of THEIR mistake", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29105-d1016688-r20445568-m11068-Young_Dong_Garden-Arcadia_California.html#review20445568", "text": "My 3 friends and I go to this place last night.
