They joined forces with Eliseo's a while back.  Yala's pizza has its own distinct taste.  Everything is made fresh daily and it tastes that way.  Yala's is more of a flat style pizza, while Eliseo's is more of a pan style.  Order a Yala's sausage and you won't get the typical crumbled sausage all the other places offer, but thinly sliced slivers of italian sausage that taste like no other.  The Yala's cheese has a bit of a sour taste to it, but that's not a bad thing, I just don't know what kind of cheese they use.
