Want something that is cooked with love and down home good? Well, my I suggest this locally owned downtown treasure. It's a little off the highway, but easy enough to get back on.

Parking downtown is easy and ample. The breakfast crowd was easy to deal with. Only open during week days. We were passing by Jackson and gave it two visits so far and will return! We were greeted at the door and asked to seat ourselves. We found a nice big booth and sat down. The walls are covered with local art work. There is a bakery counter across the room. The air was filled with wonderful aromas and folks talking over a nice breakfast or pastry. We had the same waitress each time and she is very efficient, sweet, and offered suggestions. We had great coffee and water to drink. I had the country ham with two eggs and biscuits and gravy. You can get grits, too as a side. The coffee was hot and good. The meal was prepared with love and was filling. The table had several jelly packets to choose different flavors. My  wife enjoyed her one egg, biscuits, gravy, and bacon.
