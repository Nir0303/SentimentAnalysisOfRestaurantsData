Serendipity.  Both my friend and I have visited Greece and were pleased with our dishes. Started with a mild retsina wine, cheese in filo, and saganaki.

Topped off with baklava with yogurt,  honey, and blueberry sauce and ekmek kadaifi with custard and pistachio. Friend had a Greek expresso too. Yes, we had a good time.
