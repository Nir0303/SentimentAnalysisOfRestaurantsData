Cocktails and beer featured. Most liquor available, Guinness is always on tap, and about 8-10 more taps. Typical Coors, Bud, Stella and a few average craft beers like Laguanitas, Sierra Nevada, etc \n\nSports on about 5 HDTV's and a large wall screen. Hi-tech jukebox. Large patio outback. Bands during summertime. Great St. Patrick's Day party. They also do a blowout St Patty's event on the weekend before or after March 17th.\n\nOwner's Justin & Sean are great guys & the staff is nice (YMMV depending upon attitude, lol).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-04T11:08:57-0400", "location_id": "4986594", "id": "370200460", "user": {"username": "RedZin", "user_location": {"name": "Lodi, California", "id": "32640"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Great pub!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32640-d4986594-r355095017-m11068-Ollie_s_Pub-Lodi_California.html#review355095017", "text": "Great atmosphere, great drink, awesome people.
