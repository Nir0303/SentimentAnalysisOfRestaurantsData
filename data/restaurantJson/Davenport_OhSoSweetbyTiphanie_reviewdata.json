We drove around downtown Davenport and decided to try it. Oh my goodness! We were there just as they were opening up. The cinnamon roll I had was one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! My son got a blueberry scone and thought it was fantastic! I went back for lunch and had the hot ham and cheese and a girl scout cookie inspired cupcake. Both were delicious! I will go back now that I've found it.  :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-12T15:14:46-0400", "location_id": "7704124", "id": "259170831", "user": {"username": "HEIDI H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Oversold", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37816-d7704124-r257189411-m11068-Oh_So_Sweet_by_Tiphanie-Davenport_Iowa.html#review257189411", "text": "People were friendly but I way overpaid for dry, hard cupcakes.
