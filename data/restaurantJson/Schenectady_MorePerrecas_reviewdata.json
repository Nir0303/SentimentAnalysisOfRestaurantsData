We were eating a late lunch and decided to give it a try. It was a small restaurant with an open kitchen area - the gentleman who seated us was very friendly (Rob?). Our server (Carol?) was great - she was hustling the whole time we were there and still never dropped the ball with our table at all. We were initially given dinner menus and asked if they had a lunch menu. Not being from the area, we weren't familiar with the changeover from Lunch to Dinner at 3pm. But it was 2:45pm and we were given lunch menus. It seemed that the general manager may not have agreed with the change in our menu, but were allowed to order from it. We ended up ordering the fried calamari from the dinner menu and the HOT ITALIAN MIX Panini and the CAPPICOLO & MELTED PROVOLONE TOMATO PIE PANINI from the lunch menu. We were seated beside the open kitchen area and could hear the staff exchanges throughout the meal, which wasn't necessary problematic for us. Except when our waitress inquired about the status of our calamari, the manager told her that when it was ready she'd see it in the window. It seemed sort of a harsh delivery to us - especially given that her service had been great! That's not to say that the General Manager, Chris, didn't also display some initiative and good service himself. He pitched in to help expedite and serve food - interacted with the customers directly and kept things moving.  The food was truly outstanding. Nothing to complain about there. The bathrooms were very clean. The atmosphere was friendly overall. If we had just not heard some of the interactions from the kitchen and not had the debate about lunch vs. dinner menus and time, it would have been an easy EXCELLENT review.

The staff is very friendly, and of course, the famous bread is baked next door. Good inexpensive wine selection. Great for before a show or Union hockey game. Also great breakfast with eggs in purgatory!

Very disappointed, ordered lunch special (ziti and meatballs), wife ordered stuffed blueberry french toast.To be fair, they warned us they were running behind due to power loss. No problem, over an hour later food arrived the french toast was pretty sad and my food turned out to be linguini and meatballs (must have been sitting around a while as only warm). Not even bread and great bakery attached.  Will not be going back which is a shame as used to eat there often when worked down the street.
