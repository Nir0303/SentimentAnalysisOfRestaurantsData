WOW - this place is great from start to finish.  First we were greeted by Julie, the very lovely, sweet and personable young lady that called earlier to confirm our reservation.  Then, after we chose our table (we were told to take any table of 4 that was sill open) Julie took our wine order but was soon replace by our waiter, Peter.  Again, so nice, so friendly and so very helpful in guiding us through the evenings food choices (the menu is on a chalkboard and constantly changes).  The first thing Peter brought to the table was the bread.  No, not just ordinary bread, but super good with a real crusty crust.  I already know, just from the bread, that I am going to like this place.  \n\nMy dinner began with their Delray Cerviche - just great containing swordfish.  My main course,  at Peter's suggestion, was the Rabbit.  Thanks, great suggestion.  Others in our party got Beef Short Ribs, Seafood Pasta, and Beurre Blanc Fish.  We finished by sharing a strawberry and a banana tart.  So what is there to say? - Everything we had was terrific.  Unusual, but everyone of our group really loved what they got and we all expect to come back.  Also note:  they allow you, for a $25. corkage fee, to bring your own bottle of wine.  The food here is at such a high level that you might want to bring a special bottle and pay the modest charge.\n\nAs we finished, guess who cam by our table?  Jimmy, of course.

Some of the reviewers complained about the service, but I really don't know what they are talking about. the service during our dinners has been excellent, but then I am not looking for my server to be my best friend either. They were knowledgeable about the menu, the specials and would offer recommendations if you weren't sure which of their delicious items to choose from.\nLast visit had the pork stuffed dumplings for an appetizer and the best fresh swordfish I've had in a long time.\nTheir wine list is adequate and they don't kill you on the bottle prices.\nIf you need to be part of the Atlantic avenue 'scene' this is probably not for you. If you want to have a GREAT dinner in a small, quite, casual ambiance with food prepared with care this is a must try.\nWe choose to sit at the 'bar' since it is usually just my wife and I when we go here, but it only seats 10 people and the restaurant does not have a 'bar' scene, it is strictly for dining.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-09-21T05:43:01-0400", "location_id": "1717921", "id": "312343277", "user": {"username": "Ralph D", "user_location": {"name": "Delray Beach, Florida", "id": "34179"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Food very good.
