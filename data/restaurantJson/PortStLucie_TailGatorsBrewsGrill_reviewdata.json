First the good, our waitress was super. The bad, the food was over-priced and nothing spectacular. Started with French onion soup, which was salty and not even warm. Mozzarella sticks were huge, but greasy. My husband had wings, they were ok. I had the grilled chicken sandwich, again  ok but nothing special. Fries were frozen.

We are glad we did!\n\nFrom the outside this looks like a typical sports bar and grill, however the food is definitely way better than  the average for this type of place.\n\nI had the Buffalo chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it. The chicken was hand battered and fried to perfection and the medium sauce was spicy but not overpowering. There was a generous heaping of blue cheese crumbles that nicely accentuated the sauce and chicken. The sandwich also came with Romaine lettuce and tomato. I asked for no onions which are normally included. For a side, I chose the macaroni and cheese based on the waitress's recommendation and was happy I did. It has to be among the best restaurant Mac and cheese I've ever had. Comes in a cup like a bowl of chowder. It is made with at least two kinds of cheeses and was really good.\nMy wife ordered a half rack of baby backed ribs, which were slightly overcooked, however they still had a good taste and lots of meat in them. She also had a side salad that would make any vegetarian envious.  Very nice greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. It was a very nice healthy salad that almost seemed out of place in a sports bar. No iceberg lettuce in this dish.\nThe prices are very reasonable especially considering the quality of the food. The portion sizes also left us no room for dessert. \nHighly recommend and will definitely be back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-02T17:47:07-0500", "location_id": "7360624", "id": "336801245", "user": {"username": "Fladeacon", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Surprisingly Great Food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34580-d7360624-r324475188-m11068-Tail_Gators_Brews_Grill-Port_Saint_Lucie_Florida.html#review324475188", "text": "We came in to try it because we had an enjoyment coupon.
