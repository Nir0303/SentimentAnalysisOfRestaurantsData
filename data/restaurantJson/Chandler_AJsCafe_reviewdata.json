Both of our meals were bland, my poached eggs were over done and so were her sunny sides.  The potatoes were overcooked, dried out, and lacking any seasoning.  I had requested Tabasco but didn't receive any and we didn't see our waiter again until after I had finished my meal.  On a happy note my girlfriend's toast was good.  Needless to say, this restaurant is one to miss, especially with all the great choices in the neighborhood.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-03-25T16:50:40-0400", "location_id": "5505101", "id": "198700492", "user": {"username": "CDPorche", "user_location": {"name": "Surprise, Arizona", "id": "31373"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Restaurant 11/09/13", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31190-d5505101-r184298096-m11068-AJ_s_Cafe-Chandler_Arizona.html#review184298096", "text": "Last evening my husband and I had dinner at your restaurant with 4 other friends.  It was by far the worst service that any of us have ever experienced.  Our waiter, Travis, completely ignored us. He disappeared.  Our drinks were not filled nor were we offered the dessert that came with our meal.  Love your restaurant, however, Travis needs to be properly trained; he has no clue.  Our checks were all incorrect.  Ours was overcharged by $15.00 which we caught.  I have always gotten excellent service from your bus boy, Justin.  Perhaps you should train him for your wait staff.  We are all local; not traveling.\nSincerely,\nCarolyn L.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-11-10T14:00:17-0500", "location_id": "5505101", "id": "184298096", "user": {"username": "carolyn l", "user_location": {"name": "Chandler, Arizona", "id": "31190"}}}]}
