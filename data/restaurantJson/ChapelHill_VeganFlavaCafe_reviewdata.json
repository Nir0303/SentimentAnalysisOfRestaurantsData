I am not a vegan but will admit the lunch was good. I had the Taco Supreme's and was pleasantly surprised. Instead of ground beef they mixed coarsely chopped and whole red beans as a protein. It was well seasoned and tasty. For desert we had the sweet potato pie as it was the only item available. If I were a vegan I think I would rate this 5 star excellent.\nI would recommend a stop here if only to give it a try, If you like it, go back. If not, you have had a new experience.
