It is located inside an old library. In fact it was the original Gresham Library, the Carnegie Library. It looks very distinctive. An English Tutor style building from 1912.\nThe building is on the US National Register of Historic Places.\nThe museum is run by the Gresham Historical Society. \n\nThe museum is free to the public.\n\nThey change their exhibits on a biannual basis.Displaying different aspects of Gresham history and artifacts. Today they had a new display featuring fireman and policemen that was on the south side of the building. This wasn't really of much interest to me. But that is just the half of it. There was still more to check out.\n\nOver on the north side they had the Jazz festival as the main focus. This festival is no longer held in Gresham. I used to be the Mount Hood Jazz festival. They had artwork of some of the years of the jazz festival as well as photograph of some of the performers that played. The first face that I recognized immediately was TONY BENNET. For me this half of the room was the highlight. I had totally forgotten about the old festival and the sure had some mighty good photos to promote each year of the festival.\n\nOne of their rules is that you can't take photography inside the museum. I guess that is so that what is inside remains a surprise for visitors.\n\nThe Hours they are open is rather limited:\nTuesdays and Thursdays 10 AM to 4 PM\nFridays 2 PM to 8 PM\nSaturdays 10 AM to 2 PM", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-13T19:34:26-0400", "location_id": "566989", "id": "418282991", "user": {"username": "RSNN", "user_location": {"name": "Portland, Oregon", "id": "52024"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Small but interesting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51893-d566989-r371536707-m11068-Gresham_Pioneer_Museum-Gresham_Oregon.html#review371536707", "text": "The museum is in the pretty old Gresham library building.
