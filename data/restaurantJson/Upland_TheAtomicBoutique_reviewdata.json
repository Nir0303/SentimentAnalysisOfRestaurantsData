It seems everyone who makes a purchase from their website is only given a tracking via usps but no shipment arrives at the customer's address. I experienced this with atomic boutique the first (and last) time I ever shopped with their online store. They were quite content with not sending me my package until I mentioned contacting my bank's fraud department. That was their only motivation to finally send me my $70 worth of clothing. Needless to say I will be sending this package back, collecting my refund, and taking my business elsewhere. It is also worth mentioning that the only shipping option on the website is the $20 two business day shipping method, which is the reddest flag of all that should let every consumer know that this business is indeed a scam.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-25T11:51:43-0400", "location_id": "4604281", "id": "410716682", "user": {"username": "Kayla M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Store has moved", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33206-d4604281-r403644405-m11068-The_Atomic_Boutique-Upland_California.html#review403644405", "text": "Nice little shop that's owned by a really sweet couple.
