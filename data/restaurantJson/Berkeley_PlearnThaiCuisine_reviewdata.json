Back when I lived in Oakland, in the late 90s, I would take BART up to Berkeley for a meal at the \"old\" Plearn at every opportunity.

I felt some trepidation, only partially allayed by the positive reviews here on Yelp, as to whether the place could possibly have stood the test of time and relocation without going seriously downhill, but I'm happy to say that the food is every bit as good as it used to be. The pork kang kew wan (green curry) was rich and complex, spicy but not overpowering hot. The pumpkin curry was the hit of the evening - a perfect balance of sweet, savory, and spicy.

FYI: Just because an eatery has a good write-up doesn't mean anything because it is common knowledge that restaurants \"pay\" (read bribe) reviewers to turn in a good review by offering to place ads in their rag. Anyhow, we wanted to give Plearn Thai(pronounced \"PLUN\") a chance and try it with a neutral attitude. \n\nHere are my notes:\n\n1. Service: Quite slow. \n2. Bad attitude: The owner's wife is the manager of the kitchen and you can hear her yelling in her Chinese-Thai dialect (Bangkokian Central Thai with a TaiChiew accent) and scolding her hispanic busboys. The owner and matre-D, a Chinese Thai male was quite nice. We saw the owner seat an aquaintance in the most desireable seat and then his wife blew a fuse and yelled at the owner to re-seat them in a less desireable seat. Wow, talk about inner conflict within a restaurant.\n3. Food: Fake. Phony Thai. They have some made-up dishes to trick the \"White folks\" who don't know any better. For example, the Pad Grapao chicken tastes nothing like the real Thai dish. Instead, they added MALAYSIAN Curry into the dish!! What!?!? I've never heard of this or seen this dish anywhere in SF, LA, or Bangkok. Clearly, this restaurant is successful at pulling the wool over the public's eyes.  The Tom Yum Goong soup tastes like it was made from a package, lacking a fresh flavor. The Thai Iced Tea was nothing more than sugar water. Some dish that pretended to be Chicken Larb was quite tasty though. \n4. After Effects: My Thai wife who ate with me had a bad case of DIARRHEA within 20 mins of eating at Plearn. I don't know what to say. It could have been from the Tom Yum Goong soup or the Pad Grapao chicken dish.\n\nIn conclusion, I would not go there again. I would catergorize it as just another phony Thai restaurant who caters to the ignorant non-Thais.", "helpful_votes": "7", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2005-06-01T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "377657", "id": "3520024", "user": {"username": null, "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
