We got there at 11am before the lunch rush. \n\nOur waiter was very nice, but unprepared and kind of dingy. He didn't know what the soup of the day was, didn't check on us to see if everything was okay or if we needed anything. We had to flag the hostess to get some help. But he made sure our food was cooked as requested. \n\nOur salads were fresh and the dressings were very good. My friend ordered cilantro lime salad (similar to the Cilantro Lime Chicken Tacos) without salt and she said it was perfect. (The chicken on that salad is usually pretty salty.) The Cilantro Lime Chicken Tacos are equally as good as those at Nordstrom's Blue Stove restaurants. DELICIOUS!!! \n\nWe shared for dessert the Lemon Ricotta Shortcake (which is to die for!) and the Chocolate Paradise Cake. The slice of chocolate cake is HUGE & I took half of it home! The Lemon Ricotta Shortcake has fresh raspberries, blueberries & blackberries with fresh whipped cream & lemon curd sitting in the middle of a soft shortbread. \n\nThe chocolate cake was so very moist, flavorful and little bits of toffee. It's not super rich or overly chocolately. \n\nIt was a nice place to meet a friend and visit for a while. I'd definitely eat there again!\n\nOH!

I was surprised ( pleasantly) at the difference. At my other Nordstrom, you order at a counter and your food is brought to your table via a table number. The Glendale location is full service.\n\nWe had a simple order- pizza, salad and a glass of champagne. The food was great and the service was attentive. It would have been nice to sit on the patio, but there was a large, noisy family occupying most of the tables, so we sat inside and we were the only customers inside.

Same with the drinks. \n\nWe started off with a calamari appetizer and a wings appetizer that was a special for the day. Both great! The cocktails were very well-made and priced well for being in the Americana also.\n\nEntrees were really good as well. The flatbread pizzas were great- excellent high quality ingredients and the steak sandwich was really good as well as the fries accompanying it. I would say that the onion relish was a bit too sweet for the sandwich and needed to be a bit more savory. \n\nI am still giving Bar Verde a 5/5 even though our service was very subpar. I am keeping it at 5 because, while our waitress was not good, she was not mean, and the service at the tables around us being provided by other servers was just fine.

We ended up here after turning down a two hour wait at the new dumpling house around the corner. We were seated right away by the hostess, outdoors on the patio. My husband and daughter are sensitive to direct sunlight so we opted for a table in the shade (closer to the door leading back inside) and there was a heatlamp directed at my back. As time passed the sun shifted towards our table which helped warm me up. Our drinks took a long time to arrive and we noticed that other people who came in after us had drinks and apps before us. We did order from the bar however so that could have been a factor. I had the lavender blueberry martini which was very good and not too sweet. My husband had a beer that our server described as a cross between a Hefeweizen and an IPA (he liked it). Our 5-year old daughter was given crayons and a coloring/activity sheet to keep her entertained. The children's menu is printed separately on a small piece of cardstock. We ordered the panko-crusted chicken fingers for her, they were hot, crispy and tasty. They were brought out with our appetizer (as requested) and included french fries and sliced fruit. She ate the melon but left all the pineapple. There was quite a bit of pineapple which I thought was a strange choice for the children's menu since I don't know a lot of young kids that eat it. We had the chopped chicken tacos (4) as an appetizer and they were the best thing we ate that day. The taco shells were crispy and the filling was very flavorful. I would order it as my main dish next time. My husband and I shared the crispy kale salad (meh) and the grilled chicken aioli sandwich to share. These were just OK; good but I would try something else next time. The sandwich also came with fries. Their fries are skinny and you definitely need to eat with ketchup or add salt. Our particular server was nice but seemed to be working inside as well so she was slow to check on us. There were two other patio servers who had a much better hustle with their tables.
