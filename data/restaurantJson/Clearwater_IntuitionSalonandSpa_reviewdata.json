I was very very nervous- but my stylist kelly made me feel comfortable and took the time to listen to what I wanted. I had been to 3 other salons in the St Pete area, but did not feel confident they could pull of the vintage theme I was looking for.\nSo I decided to have them do me and my wedding parties hair & make-up done there  the day of the wedding. I had 6 brides maids, 2 flower girls. We were going for a vintage style theme and we got that. I was very nervous, but this salon was able to do to pull it off and they didn't seemed stressed about it at all. This turned out to be a very good experience.

I've been going to Dawn for the last 10 years and I won't go anywhere else. I've tried other high end salons in the area and there is just no comparison. Dawn is a Master stylist and she lives up to the name, there really should be another level above that because she is in that category. She is the best of the best. I have a cut and color done and am always so happy with it. She uses all organic, vegan and cruelty free products and my hair is in great condition. The salon is relaxed and comfortable, so you don't feel intimidated, like in some other salons. Dawn and the entire staff are amazing, professional, friendly and competent. Besides hair, I've had my nails done and facials and love it all. I can't say enough good things about this salon, I'm so happy I found it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-09T08:07:55-0400", "location_id": "3579461", "id": "403247011", "user": {"username": "Allison F", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Spa party large group of girls", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d3579461-r395068735-m11068-Intuition_Salon_and_Spa-Clearwater_Florida.html#review395068735", "text": "We went a few weeks ago to this salon and spa.
