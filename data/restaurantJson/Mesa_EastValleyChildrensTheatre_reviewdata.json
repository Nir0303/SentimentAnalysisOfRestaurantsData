I took my two neighbors that are little girls and they absolutely loved the show. The children performing were professional and phenomenal... I forgot I was watching a play and felt like I was in the middle of the story! I love that it was an original play... it kept the show that much more interesting. Before hand a costume contest encouraged kids to get in the spirit of the video game-themed play. My neighbors wished they would have dressed up!  All seats in the venue at the Mesa Arts Center were good seats, even little ones could clearly see the stage.\n\nThe kids especially loved that the actors came out for photographs and autographs afterwards. They felt like they were meeting celebrities, and each actor was incredibly kind and gracious. Such a great experience! Can't wait to see the next show.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-19T19:59:46-0400", "location_id": "8352779", "id": "281497692", "user": {"username": "missmaceymouse", "user_location": {"name": "Gilbert, Arizona", "id": "31230"}}}]}
