She had ate there before and promised that their oxtail ramen was pretty good. \n\nWell, it wasn't available during our visit so we settled on a bowl or ramen and a rice bowl. We figured we could share. Since the restaurant has a BYOB policy with no charge for uncorking, we had a bottle of red wine. \n\nThe ramen was plain. It tasted like store bought ramen with roasted pork and an egg added. The rice bowl was better. Apparently the only difference between the small bowl and the large bowl is the rice amount. \n\nWe asked the wait staff and she acknowledged the broth preparation method was different due to complaints of some people saying the flavor was too strong. \n\nAs a ramen eater, the broth is the best thing in the bowl. It has to be flavorful and warm. Why the method was changed, I don't know. \n\nThe wait staff changed out the ramen for another rice bowl. All in all the food wasn't worth the trip from the Bronx. I'll keep to NYC Ramen restaurants. The best part of everything was the roasted pork. The pieces were flavorful and moist. \n\nHowever- the staff if phenomenal.
