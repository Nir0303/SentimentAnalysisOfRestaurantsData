This is such a unique concept and fantastic idea. This store contains items from several different local vendors/people who used recycled and unique materials to recreate beautiful things. The prices are honestly not too bad, they are right on par with any big name retailer, but at least when you buy locally you know you're supporting your local economy, and perhaps a single mom trying to make a living. \n\nThe store is absolutely gorgeous, and it smells amazing in there too. Some of the things you might find in there include natural soaps, candles, beautiful bracelets, scarves, clothes, natural baby products like teething rings, and paintings. I purchased this beautiful clutch, and I've already gotten several compliments on it. This summer they're offering different workshops for kids which is fantastic!\n\nThe owner is probably the friendliest person I've ever met. The entire experience was fantastic, this will be my to go place for gifts and clutches. I promise you, check this place out and you will not be disappointed!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "TrashedStudio, Owner at Trashed Studio, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for the review!!!
