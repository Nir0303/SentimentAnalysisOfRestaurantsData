I ordered a new item, lobster over fried rice. Caught my attention right away, sounded delicious. The menu states \"wok seared lobster\" . What I was served was breaded, deep fried lobster. Very greasy, french fry quality, a great way to ruin a fantastic shellfish. My server was awesome, asked if I could be served something else, I declined because I grew up being taught not eating what you are served is a sin.( I know thats silly, just something I am stuck with) I asked to talk with the manager, she came out listened to my complaint, went to the kitchen and never returned. Really gross new addition. Unbelievable that it would be described one way on the menu and served so different. French fry vs. baked potato kind of thing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-03-30T19:26:12-0400", "location_id": "343349", "id": "262788197", "user": {"username": "scott p", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Barbara, California", "id": "33045"}}}]}
