The place was packed and the staff crazy busy, and yet they continued to be able to be attentive and friendly and kept things moving along without making us feel rushed. \n\nMy friend had chicken tenders basket, which looked amazing and she said it was some of the best tenders she'd ever had. My other friend had a Greek meal, which I have forgotten, as well as the Greek fries, which she LOVED. Awesome fries anyway, but with a little feta cheese and a little Greek dressing and they were amazing. \n\nI stuck to a plain ol' grilled cheese and fries this particular day, and I have to say, I have zero complaints. It was well cooked, not burned, fries were so tasty, and overall great service too.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-10-14T10:41:04-0400", "location_id": "6539927", "id": "318629188", "user": {"username": "Val M", "user_location": {"name": "Syracuse, New York", "id": "48713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "another good  place downtown", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60974-d6539927-r267263652-m11068-Courtyard_Restaurant-Buffalo_New_York.html#review267263652", "text": "the food is regular diner food but it is very good and the prices are reasonable.
