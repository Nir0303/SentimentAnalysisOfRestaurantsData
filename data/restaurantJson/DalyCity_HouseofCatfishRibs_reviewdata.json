It was dark smokey spicy sweet and totally delicious. We loved it on the rib, which were some of the best we'd had in recent memory.\n\nThe Good: I can see that because we arrived pretty late in the day, that their chicken was a bit drier than it would have been. Could have been much juicer earlier in the day but, because of that sauce, still pretty good.\n\nThe OK: sweet potato pie. The pie filling was actually excellent, but the problem was that the crust was not done properly on the bottom, and was not as home-made as my wife (who is from the South) had hoped. An improved crust would have completely changed our impression of this pie.\n\nBut the BBQ is the authentic thing here and this had it in spades--saw them shoveling in the real wood in that black monster of a smoker.\n\nOK a word about cleanliness: (avert your eyes of you care to not think about this) This is not one of the cleanest establishments I've been to. It's seen better days, and the stove and ovens could use a good going-over. But I've decided the quality of the BBQ is what I will focus on, and will take one star off for this area. If you are a \"neat freak\" for your BBQ you are now informed. \n\nBottom-line: Will definitely go back.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-01-04T10:46:17-0500", "location_id": "368849", "id": "148833470", "user": {"username": "TanTien", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-06", "title": "Good southern food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32278-d368849-r131111992-m11068-House_of_Catfish_Ribs-Daly_City_California.html#review131111992", "text": "I've lived within walking distance from here for 3 months and just found out this place.
