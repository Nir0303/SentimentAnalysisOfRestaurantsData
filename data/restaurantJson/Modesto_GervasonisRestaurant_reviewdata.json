We just ate at Gervasoni's for the first time, and I was shocked that I had not known of its existence although I've lived here for many years. The service, atmoshpher, and, most importantly, the food was above average.

What a disappointment.  I hate to witness a restaurant that has declined from what use to be good place to eat.  In past times, it use to be  a vibrant and happening place, but sadly, not any more.  On past occasions when we have dined at this restaurant on a Friday night, the bar was full and so was the dining area.  Fast forward to today and this was not the case.  Maybe one or 2 people at the bar, and only 3 tables were occupied. The menu also has been vastly minimized to just one page.  I had the chicken marsala (at $19.99, it wasn't cheap!), which was swimming in oil when it arrived.  My husband and teenage children had the meatballs and spaghetti, and they could barely eat it, calling it 'sweet' and void of any sort of red spaghetti sauce, just greasy meat.  Don't waste your time at this restaurant.
