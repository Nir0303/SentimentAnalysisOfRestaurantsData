I only stopped into The Dev yesterday because I was lost in Utica and I really had to find a bathroom quickly. But I am very glad that I did stop in, as it was lunchtime and I doubt that I could have found a better place had I tried. As the friendly bartender told me, The Dev, which had been known and operated under a slightly different name, had a rather checkered past before closing due to physical and clientele issue. The new staff has come in and completely cleaned out the place, starting from scratch...and they've done a great job of it!\n\nI decided to eat lunch there, and ordered a chicken salad Panini sandwich. The plate arrived in just a few minutes, and presented a creative variation on the standard dish. The chicken salad was chopped quite finely, and then combined into a curry-flavored pate, which was then layered onto the Panini with a slightly sweet chutney and some spring lettuce sprigs. It was very tasty, and accompanied by a side order of seasoned garbanzo bean salad. Very nice!\n\nThe inside of the bar/restaurant was decorated with the works of some local artists, which are rotated on a monthly basis. Above the bar were displayed an array of early-1900s radios, with their wooden cases an old-fashioned dials.\n\nThis was a really nice break in my day, made all the more pleasant by the conversation of the female bartender and male co-worker...very nice people!

The Devereaux has had its ups and downs over the years and the \"new\" version looked like they'd really made some things happen.  The menu looked inviting, the place was cleaned up, the beer selection is excellent, so we headed over ready to enjoy.  The beer selection and atmosphere held up their end of the bargain.  But the dinner part, not so much.  It wasn't really the food.  The food was decent.  I ordered the arugula salad (it came without a leaf of arugula) but was tasty just the same, although a bit heavy-handed on the sundried tomatoes.  I also ordered the hummus wrap, which was good, although the hummus was a little bland.  The major problem was the service.  We arrived around 7:45pm and there was another couple already dining.  I didn't see anyone else ordering food or eating.  So that was it, a table of two and the three of us.  We ordered -- an appetizer, three salads and three sandwiches (two hummus wraps and an egg, ham and swiss grilled sandwich).  About 20 minutes later (yes, I said 20 minutes) two of the sandwiches arrive.  No silverware, just two of our sandwiches (the cold hummus ones).  No appetizer, no salads first, just sandwiches. Then, we sit for at least another 4 minutes - looking at the \"hot\" sandwich sitting on the ledge of the kitchen service window.  We could see it!  What we couldn't see was our waitress.   Gone -- literally -- not visible anywhere.  We watched a number of employees look at the sandwich and walk away.  At one point, a friend of mine stood up to start walking over and grab it herself.  Then the waitress appeared.  She brought the \"lukewarm\" sandwich and everything else that we'd ordered -- all at once.  The food was ok. The appetizer, blue cheese crostini -- was really quite yummy, but hard to enjoy with a table full of our dinner.\n\nSo, I imagine that if they get their \"thang\" together -- it could be a decent place.
