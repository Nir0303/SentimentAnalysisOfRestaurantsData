My first afternoon back in Berkeley so I didn't know anything about it. I chose take out although there are tables. The king falafel wrap was superb. Prepared after I ordered. The waiter gave me a glass of tea while I waited. There was also mint infused water. I'd love to try some of the other items but won't be here long enough.\nThis is a new family owned restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-15T19:05:02-0400", "location_id": "10435897", "id": "382990007", "user": {"username": "kmcgardener", "user_location": {"name": "Regina, Canada", "id": "155042"}}}]}
