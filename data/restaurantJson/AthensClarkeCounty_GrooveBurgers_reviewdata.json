I wasn't really in the mood for a burger and my wife was nursing a recent stomach virus, so we can't review how the burgers are.  But I had a Philly Chesse sandwich and it was absolutely one of the best I've ever eaten in my life.  My wife had a good grilled cheese sandwich.  The onion rings were fresh and outstanding!  The sausage balls also were delicious.  The only reason we can't rate this as excellent is my wife had a vanilla shake and said it was not quite as tasty as she would have liked.

My hubby also appreciated that there was good beer available. \n\nService: We were quick to be seated and have drink and food orders taken. The waitress was especially patient with my hubby as he took forever to decide what beer he wanted. The waitress and staff checked on us often, but not in an overly suffocating way. They even checked on us again after we paid and were just taking up space. \n\nAtmosphere: My hubby called it post-modern industrial. It was not cozy or particularly comfy. I found the metal chairs quite uncomfortable for my wide butt. Thankfully my hubby let me switch with him and I got to sit on a wooden bench instead. \n\nPrice: We got one appetizer, two big burgers, one side, one beer and one soda for $30.

I was with a friend and we ordered and sat down. The lady at the counter wasn't really friendly. The place wasn't busy, but we had to wait a long time to get our food. They forgot to cook mine at the same time and had to wait an additional 5 minutes for my food. My friend got fries with their food. The fries weren't seasoned at all and weren't cooked too great. Her burger wasn't that great either. I ordered the groove burger and onion rings. The burger didn't taste that good at all. The caramelized onions weren't good on it at all and the burger wasn't seasoned good. I don't know how you can mess up a bacon cheeseburger with onions but they did. The onion rings were ok. They weren't cooked enough for me. The best part of the meal was the breading on the onion rings. I'd say not to waste your time here and go to five guys or grind house to get a good burger.

Burgers are custom prepared.  Onion rings were very good.  Burgers tasted good, although a little greasy.  There are a number of TV screens.
