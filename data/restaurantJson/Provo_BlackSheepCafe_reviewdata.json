Yesterday was that day and I read reviews  and found the Black Sheep Cafe.  It was a great lunch.  My husband and son had the Bleu Cheese Burger with Rosemary Fries and the Black Sheep Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  I had the Black Sheep Navajo Taco which is a vegan option.  We took a family friend with us who was visiting for a few days.  He also had the one of the Buffalo Navajo Tacos.  We all loved them.  The sweet potato fries were a huge hit with all of us.  We all had to sample them.  Their fry sauce was some of the best I've tasted and every food establishment in Utah as some sort of fry sauce.  Their portion sizes were pretty ample and I couldn't finish all of my entree and our family friend couldn't finish all of his.  They serve plenty of food.   It's a small restaurant but we went at 2pm and got right in and were served quickly.
