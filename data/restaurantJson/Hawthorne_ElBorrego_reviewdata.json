We were surprised by the choices and quality of food as well as the great service.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside and the seating area is very plain.  However, the menu is extensive with lots of interesting choices.  We ate there twice and tried shrimp in garlic sauce, seafood soup, chicken fajitas, and chicken tacos.  The seafood soup was really attractive, but messy to eat.  It was super spicy.  Everything else was great.  The service was excellent and the price was right.

The service is top notch, the owner will serve you homemade tortilla chips with some bomb salsa. The jarritos are refreshing though I didn't try the horchata. The owner recommended the enchiladas suisa so I took his suggestion. Delicious. Chunks of seasoned chicken, not tasteless shredded meat, a delicious green sauce and nice crema. The beans were really good and I even ate the rice! My friend has the carnitas plate, which was freshly made. A nice portion, well seasoned and served with hot tortillas. I'm going back for the lamb stew which the owner cooks in a pit at his house. Try this place when you want some really quality Mexican food with excellent service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-03T17:28:25-0500", "location_id": "5422548", "id": "344869002", "user": {"username": "Jo Ann O", "user_location": {"name": "Rolling Hills Estates, California", "id": "32984"}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Buen restaurante Mexicano", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32478-d5422548-r334777962-m11068-El_Borrego-Hawthorne_California.html#review334777962", "text": "Este es un buen restaurante si quieres comer comida t\u00edpica mexicana, buen sabor, una agradable experiencia.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-24T04:54:36-0500", "location_id": "5422548", "id": "334777962", "user": {"username": "drago_29", "user_location": {"name": "Republica Dominicana", "id": null}}}]}
