After seeing reviews mentioning great breakfasts and Greek food, I decided to try the place.  Serving St. Clair Shores for over 25 years, the small diner was doing brisk business on Saturday, so obviously a local crowd knows exactly where they are.  Karas Family Restaurant is located on the east side of Harper, between Erben and Yale, just south of a vehicle glass replacement center.  \n\nThe place is small with booth and counter seating.  The kitchen area is compact and it is rather amazing to see three cooks, kitchen help and wait staff moving deftly through the small space with no mishaps.  The staff is friendly.  The service is prompt and accommodating.  In such a small diner, this suggests the Karas Family Restaurant waitresses are used to managing a full house on a regular basis and happily seem to be enjoying this.  They work together well.   \n\nBreakfast is offered all day and the omelet selection is interesting.  I tried a small Greek salad with grilled pita and a fried egg sandwich.  The salad is served with a bottle of Greek dressing so you can add it as you like.  The pita and the sandwich were tasty.  \n\nThis is a family operation.  Owned by Lazaros Karavidas and run predominantly by his family, Mom was in the back while her friendly son was at the grill.  Some lovely artwork, available for sale, decorates the walls.  The cooking area is wonderfully kitschy, festooned with Greek mementos\u2014the kind of d\u00e9cor that gives a diner its unique color.   Karas Family Restaurant has a vintage diner look that the regulars obviously enjoy.  The prices are reasonable and the food is good.  The hours are 7am to 4pm.  I'd like to return to try one of the omelets.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-07T06:11:17-0400", "location_id": "4626957", "id": "278476433", "user": {"username": "pasiphae", "user_location": {"name": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Don't miss this ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42669-d4626957-r276190223-m11068-Karas_Restaurants-Saint_Clair_Shores_Michigan.html#review276190223", "text": "Easy to drive past because it is so small.

The staff is all related and makes you feel right at home.\n\nI can only speak of the breakfast experience.\n\nThe menu include both Greek and American dishes. Frankly, I was shocked at the price. My two large buttermilk wheatcakes with three strips of bacon was only $3.95 (5/15) and they were light and fluffy. Our granddaughter's pancakes were shaped like Micky Mouse. If you order a breakfast that comes with toast, consider ordering pita instead for a delicious touch. My husband's eggs were poached perfectly. And everything came up hot and fast.\n\nIt's fun to watch the fellows at work in the open kitchen. As they cook, they chat and tease with guests. They all even came over to peer our newborn grandchild. And working behind the scene is their 90 year old mother, peeling potatoes, busing tables and coming out to make sure everyone is happy.\n\nI almost hate to recommend this tiny diner because I'd hate to find that next time I can't get a seat!
