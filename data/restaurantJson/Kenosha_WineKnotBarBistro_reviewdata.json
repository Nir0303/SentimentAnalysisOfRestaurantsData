Only blocks from the lake in a cute section of town, Wine Knot is a great spot to bring friends and family for a beverage, apps, or the entire meal. \n\nI recently visited the Knot with work colleagues and we had a lovely time.  The wine list has plenty of standards but I especially liked the fact that there are delicious eclectic choices such as a Spanish Albari\u00f1o or a Chilean Carmenere.  These are terrific food wines that aren't as well known but as a result they are reasonably priced and worth a try.  \n\nWe tried and enjoyed a number of apps. Some favorites were the pizza, the spinach and artichoke dip, and the fries.  For entrees the halibut is a house favorite and it was a hit with a couple in our crew.  The seafood stew was excellent (do add the jalape\u00f1os, cilantro and radishes to the dish - liberally for a great kick!).  The flat iron steak was a hit and it wasn't as \"flat\" as some speculated.  Some of the sides, such as the brussel sprouts were given big thumbs up.  \n\nService was excellent and our server gave some great advice on dishes to try.  We did try a couple desserts and they were also excellent. My favorite was the peanut butter and chocolate special but the chocolate pyramid was also good. \n\nAll in the Knot was a lovely surprise and we all went home satiated and happy.  Give the Wine Knot a try and you won't be disappointed.
