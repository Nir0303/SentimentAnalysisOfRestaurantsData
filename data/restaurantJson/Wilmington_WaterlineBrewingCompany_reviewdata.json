The bad news is you'll need to arrange a driver in any event because they make some downright delicious beer! The stout is smooth, rich, flavorful, and clean. No tongue-coating, palette heaviness here. As quaffable a stout as I think I've ever tasted. The kolsch is as it should be. Light, crisp, and refreshing, straightforward with no bite or bitterness. Enough body to show you it's real beer, but dangerously drinkable to the point that I think if you had nothing but this you would find yourself curled up under the table quite by surprise. They produce a not-quite-IPA (in my opinion) red ale for the local Fox & Hound which I find absolutely amazing. You get all of the floral, fruity aromas of some amazing hops, with a deep flavor profile. It's crisp and clean (do you see a pattern here?) but at the point that you expect the hops to clamp down on your tongue and make your heart skip a beat you're left with a long, pleasant finish. If you're not a particular fan of IPAs (I'm not) you'll probably find yourself a bit puzzled as you take a second and third sip and attempt to figure out what just happened. By the time you're halfway through the pint you will relax and start to enjoy the novel concept of enjoying a heavy load of hops without being offended by the bitterness and bite that usually comes along for the ride. The hefeweizen is well made, but VERY sweet. We actually cut it with a bit of \"regular\" IPA to tone it down a bit. While it was a good beer, it is not a particular favorite of mine.\n\nIn any event, if you're a fan of beer then you need to keep an eye peeled for Waterline or make plans to visit them.
