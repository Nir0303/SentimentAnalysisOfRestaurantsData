They advertised coffee, sandwiches and pastries on the door. It's been in business for several months now.\nNice decor, pleasant smell. \nAs we went in, there were three students in one corner and a small family getting ready to leave. \nWe were feeling peckish, so we thought we'd try a sandwich and a cup of coffee.  \nThere were no sandwiches, and only a few prepackaged pastries. None of it was made on site. Mine was dry and sugary. My husband had some chobani yogurt. We both ordered drip coffee. My coffee was cold but otherwise tasted good.  My husband's was hot but he didn't like the way it tasted at all. \nThe barista was nice and pleasant, though, so it's probably not her. \n\nFinal analysis? Stay away until they live up to their stated objectives. And maybe try a latte instead.  If you look through my reviews,  you'll see that they are mostly positive. I do hope this place improves, it's just not there yet.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-11-28T09:34:19-0500", "location_id": "7322789", "id": "241862379", "user": {"username": "Antoinette D", "user_location": {"name": "Ellensburg, Washington", "id": "58456"}}}]}
