They have some gorgeous pieces of sculpture as well.  Prices are in line with the quality -- Santa Fe isn't cheap!  But if you want something truly different, check here. I purchased some silver earrings in a geometric pattern and every time I wear them I get complements.

The only downside is that all of these beautiful things come at a fairly high price. The brands they carry are pretty high end and can be expensive.
