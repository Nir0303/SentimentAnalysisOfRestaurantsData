First time visit for me although I've long heard about this Palm Bay institution.  The atmosphere is casual with a full bar area.   Seat yourself.   Not too much noise emitting from the bar area (not a rowdy \"young\" crowd.  The patrons appeared to be of the \"mature\" age group.).  Our waitress appeared hurried and unfamiliar with the daily specials, soup du jour, vegetable of the day.  The seafood trio was nice - three different fish - Mahi, cod, haddock.   The fish was very tasty - prepared broiled with Cajun seasoning.   The portions were generous.   For sides, I had white corn - nothing extraordinary there - a rather small portion, and, a garden salad - again, nothing special and a bit on the skimpy side.  A bread basket with dinner rolls came with the meals.  My friend had the liver and onions with mashed potatoes and gravy along with a dinner salad.   She was not impressed with the liver - something she very much enjoys.   She left most behind.  The restrooms were clean.  The waitress could have been more attentive and refilled our beverage glasses.  The menu had a variety of items available - many comfort foods.   Fair pricing.
