And I did! The massage I got during the facial was better than the actual massage. She was attentive to her job and let me lead on conversation. Very relaxing.\nThe massage wasn't great. The masseuse didn't seem there and didn't use enough pressure. She was small, so maybe just not strong enough. I just know I had been looking forward to it for months and was disappointed. \nThe pedicure was also so-so. The technician was very inattentive and it was just a pedicure, not even as good as the one I usually get for $25. (I think the basic is $40 here). \nThey also use scents constantly, in every step and I'm not a fan. The facility is nice (I went downtown) and the robes are super.
