Our waitress was inexperienced, but pleasant.  Three out of four entrees came out together and when after 15-20 minutes the 4th had still not arrived the waitress said she'd put it in again. Another 29 minutes and nothing so we decided to leave.  Even then, it was another 20 minutes to get the check - and, it was relatively early so they were not overly busy. But the absolute worst was the noise level.  There was loud, harsh music blaring.  The manager agreed to turn it down 'one notch' but that was little help.  It was impossible to have a conversation.  In fact, the noise level was painful - contributing to our desire to leave as soon as possible.  Despite the signs in the hotel - this is not a cosy wine bar and bistro.  If you value your hearing and the company you're with then skip this one.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-08-02T08:31:56-0400", "location_id": "5841120", "id": "219064641", "user": {"username": "pddoc2", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Most delicious salmon sliders!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60880-d5841120-r214541166-m11068-The_Whale_s_Tail-Anchorage_Alaska.html#review214541166", "text": "We really liked the decor and ambiance of The Whale's Tail.
