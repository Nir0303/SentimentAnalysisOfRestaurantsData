I had to ASK her nicely if I could choose from one of those, as I really didn't want to buy the raw looking one so nicely packaged in the clear plastic container up front. \nWell - the ones in back weren't much better, but I went ahead a bought one because my kids saw the \"Best Food Ever\" show and wanted to try the cinnamon roll.  NOT impressed.  Between four of us trying it, even after being warmed up at home, we all agreed that it was mediocre at best. In fact we didn't even finish it.  Too much frosting, not enough cinnamon roll to make it worth finishing.  And the size of the cinnamon roll was nothing like what was shown on the TLC show.

It was obvious it had been sitting there at least all day, if not longer and was in a plastic container. I thought surely they are going to offer to heat it up. Nope! We also ordered the brownie that's known as the \"better than sex brownie\". \n\nWe sat down thinking, \"ok.. maybe they don't have to be heated up.
