Ever bite of my pizza was dough dough and more dough.  Every bite of my pizza was overwhelmed by the taste of flour.  I ordered some strong toppings on my pie, it lacked sauce and the dough flour flavor masked the flavor of my favorite pizza toppings.  Service was adequate, she, however was more interested in visiting with her friends/coworkers at the top level of the bar than our lower level  table.  Also, don't order the pretzels.  They are just pizza dough twisted into a pretzel shape and sort of baked.  They appeared to me to be a mellow mushroom knock off.  I am sure that this place is very popular because of the vast and wide variety of beer.  Enjoy your beer, but skip the pizza pie!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-07-14T21:05:54-0400", "location_id": "5841082", "id": "215463590", "user": {"username": "BlueCricket", "user_location": {"name": "Kentucky", "id": null}}}]}
