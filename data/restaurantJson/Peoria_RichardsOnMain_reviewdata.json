Good food and fast service.  A great alternative to the food carts at lunch time.  They are also open late, which is nice because there are limited choices in the area for good hot food. If you find yourself out in the downtown area definately stop in for a bite.  They have a good range of food choices from a giant grilled cheese on a club to grilled chicken to pizza.

You enter on the sidewalk and go down stairs into the bar. The food is really good and has a great variety at reasonable prices. Good selection of tap and bottle beers.
