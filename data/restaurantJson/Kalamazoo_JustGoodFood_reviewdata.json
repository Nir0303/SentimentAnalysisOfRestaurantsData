She said a few more rude comments and I told her to just give me my $20.00 deposit back.  After trying a number of times she COULD NOT FIND OUR ORDER.  I asked to right down that I did not get a turkey and I would be back.  I made a trip home to print out my debit card statement showing it HAD been paid for and made another trip downtown.  While she was trying to find the mistake in the computer again, I asked to just give me the $20.00.  She offered to sell me a turkey off the truck, but I told her because of the incredibly rude way she treated me that morning that I would rather eat hotdogs for Thanksgiving than buy from her.
