OK for families with kids perhaps; basic formica type tables and Mexican TV program: Found the food to be so-so. My friend had cheese enchiladas and I had the fajitas.

The food is prepared fresh an on-site.  The tacos are my favorite.  Also, I'm not sure if the hot sauce is bottled, but I can't get enough of it.   It's a great place to go if you have a craving for some authentic, home cooked, Mexican Taqueria style food.\n\nPROS\n* Authentic home cooked Mexican Food\n* Mom / Pop independent owners\n* Can customer make anything for you upon request (i.e. grilled and diced Jalapenos)\n\nCONS\n* I always seem to walk out of there wondering why I spent so much on Taqueria food.  It's a little on the high side. ($15+) --- but I don't mind helping an independent restaurateur.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-10-20T09:24:29-0400", "location_id": "2676229", "id": "320427392", "user": {"username": "Tim E", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Hole in the wall Mexican spot; tasty enchiladas and tacos ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55870-d2676229-r279961492-m11068-La_Unica_Taqueria-Frisco_Texas.html#review279961492", "text": "This place is in an old house with maybe 8 tables and a small menu.
