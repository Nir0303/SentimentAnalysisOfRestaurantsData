They still have wonderful, mouth-watering bakery goods and lunch offerings. What I find frustrating, is the lack of table space for other customers due to the availability of free Wi-Fi.

Cake by the slice, individual desserts, all wonderful. To go or stuff your face at the table.\n\nThey are really coming into their lunch offerings. Homemade soups are good and sandwiches are for the most part, darn good. Large dining area, plenty of room to dine. I think they need to really work a bit harder to perfect their lunch offerings as they have with their desserts. I really do trust it will come together, but they need a really good menu chef to tie this all together. The pastry chef and lunch chef cannot be one in the same.\n\nA little nudge, sometimes you hire some real goofs who are not 100% customer oriented, but rather just are there for a paycheck. And then I will say, most of your staff are really good folks who realize the customer is what keeps the doors open. Give this place a shot.

They did a great job with the huge ceiling and original exposed brick. It is very roomy, lots of seating, nice chairs and tables. A great place to take a large group or just sit and read or do homework for hours without being crowded. I have eaten several things off the menu which is creative, though I think they could knock down each item a couple dollars. I enjoy the coffee, and my latte even had a bear made out of foam once! Young, friendly staff. The pastries could be bigger and cheaper, but I love the large coconut macaroons. NOTE: the French Macaroons are NOT homemade- they are shipped in. So, I don't think that is worth it. Get your macaroons from Botegga Louie in LA- Freshly made! Buying a large slice of cake for $5 is the best deal in the house. So, go get yourself a latte and a slice of cake and enjoy hanging out for a while.
