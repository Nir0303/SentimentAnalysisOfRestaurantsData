It was great, as the service was friendly and prompt, the cheese curds were great, and the beer was good as well. Also, the band jamming on Christmas songs added to the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, we returned this year, attempting to experience the great atmosphere we encountered a year before. Wow, did this place go DOWNHILL!!! First, the bartender had the personality of a mannequin. She wasn't knowledgeable about the beer selections (what little they have), acting as if she wasn't interested. Also, she didn't understand what a Black & Tan was...isn't this an IRISH PUB??? Overall, she was cardboard and not friendly. Not to mention, the Guinness was FLAT!!!\n\nWe ordered a cup (not a bowl) of beef stew and potato soup. Other orders passed, and being patient as I am, I sat and drank my beer, without being concerned. However, after 30 minutes passed, I was wondering where the soup/stew was. I politely asked the bartender and she said, with a straight face, \"it won't be long.\" After waiting forever, I decided to ask for my check. I was willing to pay for something I never received! Shortly after we put on our coats and paid, the soup/stew came out. \n\nWhen they FINALLY arrived, they were cold! The cheese wasn't even melted on the potato soup! I ate a few bites and decided this was prison food! I nodded to my girlfriend and we walked out. It is sad to see such a cool atmosphere go down over a year's time. We were sure that management had changed. If you want to go to an Irish Pub, keep looking! If you want good bar food and beer, keep walking!
