Do not ever sit upstairs as you will be ignored, you will have to wait a long time for your food and a lot of times when the servers actually bring the food upstairs they're not sure which table it should go to, and if you need a quick beer refill plan on waiting for quite a while as the servers have to go downstairs to get your alcoholic beverage. This place could be the number one restaurant/bar in downtown Bismarck but because their service is lacking it's simply cannot be rated number one. I will continue to come back to this restaurant as I know different servers provide different types of experiences!

The Taco Dip is huge, so flavorful and always perfect.  It goes perfectly with a cold beer or a Canadian whiskey.\n\nThe service at the Pond is also consistent.  It is always horrible.  Last Saturday August 20th we arrived around 4 PM in the afternoon and sat down in the patio.  After 15 minutes a waitress finally recognized us, handed us menus and then told us our server would be right with us.  Three more parties entered the patio.  Each party had ordered and received there first round of drinks before we had been approached by a server.  I finally went up to an employee that appeared competent. I asked if we were sitting at a table that did not receive service.  She apologized, stating that here was a shift change.  She then took our order and became our server.  She provided us with more than adequate service for the rest of our stay.\n\nThe problem is that this type of breakdown happens every time we go there.  And we want to go there a lot because I crave the Taco Dip. A friend heard that we were going out for afternoon drinks and cocktails and wanted to join us.  When we told them we were going to the Pond they recanted their invitation.  They stated that the last time they went to the Pond it took 45 minutes for them to put in a drink order.  Last Saturday it was not overwhelmingly busy.  There always seemed to be employees talking at the bar to other employees.  Please put a manager on duty to ensure effective service.  And if a manager was on duty last Saturday then I suggest looking at a different manager.  The server that helped us seems like an option. She was extremely professional once she found us.\n\nThe patio at the Pond is a beautiful venue.  Your food is awesome.
