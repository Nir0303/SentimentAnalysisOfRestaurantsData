If you get there early enough there are some places to sit, which is wonderfu.l It's not all standing room only. There is also a balcony with some seating as well. This place is a short person's dream come true. There really is not a bad seat( or standing spot) in the house. This is a small venue which makes for a very intimate show. I would love to go back and see another concert there!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-14T17:55:16-0400", "location_id": "7923632", "id": "364262741", "user": {"username": "Donna Marie R", "user_location": {"name": "Lincoln City, Oregon", "id": "51947"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Fun concert venue", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d7923632-r279120495-m11068-Star_Theater-Portland_Oregon.html#review279120495", "text": "This is a renovated old theater that has been turned into a concert venue with a bar.

Everybody was friendly and relaxed, it was NOT a venue full of drunks like a lot of concert venues.
