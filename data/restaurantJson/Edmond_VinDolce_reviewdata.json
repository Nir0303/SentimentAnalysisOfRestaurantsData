The place was almost completely empty.  We were seated promptly and provided drink menus.  They have a decent selection of wines, although we did not recognize most of them, and my wife selected a decent pinot noir.  I, however, had to argue about what drink I was allowed to order.  I began by asking for calvados, my usual after dinner drink and they do not carry it.  The bartender/waiter tried to turn me on to a brandy that cost $17 a glass by providing me a small sample.  I next decided that I would just have a glass of prosecco.  The waiter/bartender essentially refused to serve me the prosecco and continued to try to describe what exactly it was I was looking for in a drink.  Trying to not stand up and walk out, I humored him and allowed him to fix me a drink.  He brings me a \"white lady\" which was actually very refreshing, but not really what I was looking for.  \n\nA few points:\n\n1. The place was really empty for a Friday night and didnt seem to be picking up.\n2. Try letting your patrons decide what they want.  I really dont appreciate having someone refuse my drink order then try to talk me into something I have no interest in.  In retrospect, we should have left at this point but since it was my wife's birthday, I decided to just go with it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-09-09T09:06:42-0400", "location_id": "4339895", "id": "176483148", "user": {"username": "53Alex", "user_location": {"name": "OKC, OK", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-06", "title": "Swanky place!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51327-d4339895-r167398453-m11068-Vin_Dolce-Edmond_Oklahoma.html#review167398453", "text": "The staff and management are truly exceptional.
