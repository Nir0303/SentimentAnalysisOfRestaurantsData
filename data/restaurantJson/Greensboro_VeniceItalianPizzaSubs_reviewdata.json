And the pizza was nowhere near the quality that I was accustomed to at Venice.  To my surprise Venice has changed owners as of two months ago. This after 5 years of eating here, is the worst EVER.  New owners here at Venice are horrible! And the manager needs to rethink his managerial skills,  maybe take some courses, nor only did he hold the phone in hesitation mode,  he did not even attempt to resolve my issues.  He was a drab to talk to.

The delivery to the hotel was efficient and painless. I was able to place the order online, received email and text confirmation. The delivery timeframe estimate was pretty accurate, and the prices are  reasonable.  \n\nI had the opportunity to try a few items from the menu.  The chicken parmigiana was interesting.  The chicken was delicious, but the spaghetti it was served with I didn't enjoy at all.  There was also a piece of so-called garlic bread served with it.  It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't anything exciting. It was very plain. I dipped it in ranch dressing and this helped. The side salad was fine. I tried a couple of the Cajun fries, they were just crinkle cut fries with a bunch of Cajun seasoning. They tasted fine, nothing exciting. Finally, the chocolate cake was pretty good. Fairly moist and the icing was good. \n\nOverall, a good meal and good service. Just wish the food was all consistently delicious instead of hit or miss.
