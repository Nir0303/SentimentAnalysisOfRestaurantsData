Place was clean and the staff was friendly and fun. Ice maker was broken so no fountain drinks. They did have cans of soda but were not priced accordingly in my mind. On to the sandwiches which were pretty good, but not the best I have had. What really knocked them down for me was that I paid for extra meat in one sandwich and got regular meat and onions in another. We didn't see or feel any difference. Only way to tell them apart was to look for the onions.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-12-03T16:26:59-0500", "location_id": "4275604", "id": "242849027", "user": {"username": "Rod P", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "Don't waste your time", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33668-d4275604-r195021629-m11068-Taste_of_Philly-Thornton_Colorado.html#review195021629", "text": "I moved to CO from VA about 6 months ago and I am still searching for a great Chicken Cheese Steak (we LOVE the cheesesteaks at Santini's back in VA).  So I did a google search and thought we would try this place. It was not gross, but it is not a do again for us.  Basically the staff was not friendly, unkempt with holes in his shirt and did not seem to care about their customers.\nex.  Their soda machine was out of CO2 and I asked if they had more. A gruff man (also with worn holes in his shirt) walked by to go to the back (I think) then after about 5 mins. walked back by, but NEVER said a word to me or checked to see if the machine was working.  It was not, still not CO2.  I was not in the mood to deal with mean men.  So I sipped my flat soda.\nI really cannot find a pro about this place.  Usually people in CO are very friendly.  This place was definitely NOT.  I got a chicken philly and french fries, it was mostly bread, with dried chicken and dried onions and peppers, but the french fries were freshly cooked. This was NOT what I was looking for, so (sigh) I will keep my search going.  So far South Philly CheeseSteak is the closest thing we have found that has a decent cheesesteak", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-02-22T16:05:36-0500", "location_id": "4275604", "id": "195021629", "user": {"username": "RUREC95", "user_location": {"name": "DC", "id": null}}}]}
