Not only did we find treasures, we met two of the most delightful, helpful, funny, and charming gentlemen.  Jeremy and Tom were outstanding and we thoroughly enjoyed talking with them.  They too are treasures!\nThe store had so many terrific pieces, but alas, my vehicle was not an 18 wheeler so we could not get all of the many super treasures our eyes saw.  We had to leave and go seek eye drops to sooth our strained baby blues and browns.\nIndeed this is a  must  for all antique seekers, and I promise you won't be disappointed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-24T14:30:53-0400", "location_id": "11739356", "id": "431335332", "user": {"username": "251Brem12", "user_location": {"name": "Montgomery, Alabama", "id": null}}}]}
