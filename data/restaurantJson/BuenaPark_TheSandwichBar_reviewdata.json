Went to web site it stated \"CLOSED\" but I remember the hours were 8 to 4pm(Weird hours)web site said 6pm but OK. So I called to place my order the young lady that answered the phone asked me to wait and wait I did. With phone placed somewhere where I could hear every laugh, word and what seemed to be music in back ground I waited(APX 10 minutes) so I then decided to make my 15 minute drive to this Sandwich Bar remaining on my phone. Got there APX 25 minutes of being on hold to find the girl that I had talked to on her own phone outside. I then went inside talked to Chef (Manager)(Really he was the only person that was trying hard in this establishment)he was embarrassed and girl apologized as OOPPS Sorry??(The phone was at eye level at cash register, lol. OK Placed my order paid FULL PRICE only to find out that all those cool things I wanted to try on the menu they were OUT of or had to be altered. I then continued to wait another APX 20 -25 minutes for a Sandwich and a Greek Salad (with Jalape\u00f1os) oh Greek salads don't have Jalape\u00f1os (Almost choked my Wife who is heat sensitive) **come on really????? While waiting I observed and noticed the place was Filthy, not organized, a food grade of \"F\" ready to happen and the girl employee just continued to go outside to her texting or whatever while the sandwich chef did everything poor guy. Anyway after watching food(house potato chips) handled with bare hands(threw those away) I pretty much almost asked for a refund but just wanted out of my nightmare. Yikes I don't Likes this place. Go any where but here. Sorry Sandwich Shop hope you can turn it around, I'm sure this was not the intention of it's creator.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-10T23:25:32-0400", "location_id": "1057854", "id": "363240407", "user": {"username": "Mike M", "user_location": {"name": "La Mirada, California", "id": "32580"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Try the Cubano sandwich!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32122-d1057854-r239713753-m11068-The_Sandwich_Bar-Buena_Park_California.html#review239713753", "text": "So far the only sandwich I tried was the Cubano with homemade chips and it was very good. I'm sure if I went to Florida and tried a Cuban sandwich it would taste more authentic, but I never had on so this one is great! It also came with soup and it was good as well. The place is clean and people friendly. This is my new lunch spot. This meal filled me up so for just under $9.00 I'm good till dinner!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-11-13T13:06:43-0500", "location_id": "1057854", "id": "239713753", "user": {"username": "doggiedaddie", "user_location": {"name": "Long Beach, California", "id": null}}}]}
