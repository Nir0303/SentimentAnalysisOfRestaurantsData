Used to be the best place for the typical deli fare - sandwiches, burgers, wraps, salads - but lately there always seems to be something wrong with the order.  Sandwich prepared wrong (they grilled a sandwich ordered ungrilled); wrong sides; ice tea comes out like tinted water.  My friend ordered a plain grilled chicken sandwich like she always used to, but now they serve it something like \"Cajun\" spiced which she was unable to eat, the staff explanation being they've switched vendors and you have to \"ask\" for a plain chicken breast, but no changes on their menu saying it's spiced already.  It has a pleasant sports bar ambience, is very conveniently located in downtown W-S, and the staff is friendly - which is why I give it 3-dots instead of 2.  But if you want to spend on average $8-10 for lunch, go spend that money elsewhere.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-05-16T10:20:32-0400", "location_id": "4083130", "id": "205819526", "user": {"username": "Suzuspetals", "user_location": {"name": "N.C.", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-07", "title": "Best service, tasty sandwiches, but I miss the fried green beans", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49680-d4083130-r167114268-m11068-Downtown_Deli_Cafe-Winston_Salem_North_Carolina.html#review167114268", "text": "This place consistently has the best service.
