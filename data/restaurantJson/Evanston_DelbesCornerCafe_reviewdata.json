Fantastic customer service, tasty sandwiches and drinks, local ambiance, and a cozy atmosphere. I really love to support local businesses and this place is the epitome of great local business. Take that, Starbucks!\n\nI discovered Delbe's Corner through Yelp on a visit to Northwestern University, and what a find it was. It's a little ways from the school itself, but it was more than worth the walk in the frigid temperatures. The store is indeed on a corner, with big windows overlooking the street and it just invites you in. The place has a comfy feel, with a combination of tables and some comfy couches and easy chairs. It was also super clean and decorated in a Pac-Man motif, which I thought was pretty cute. If I attended Northwestern, I could definitely see myself studying or bringing a coffee date here. I was the only one in the shop on a cool morning, which worried me a bit at first, but then I realized my nerves were for naught. The owner, Tasha, greeted me warmly and helped me decide what to order, offering to customize things however I wanted. I ended up ordering the Sunrise breakfast sandwich (scrambled egg, bacon, ham, american and pepperjack) and a pumpkin latte. Her husband makes the sandwiches and she's the barista, so it's not a fast, assembly line style operation but the wait is more than worth it. She chatted with me while I waited, and I found out that she was originally from my area, so we got to swap a few stories.  \n\nSo the service was wonderful, but how was the food? The breakfast sandwich was just fantastic. It was the steamed bagel sandwich style (love!), which melted the cheese perfectly and made for a delicious, hot breakfast. Instead of an everything bagel, I got it on cinnamon raisin, which was the ideal blend of sweet and savory. Lastly, I have to say the pumpkin latte was a little bitter for my tastes. I was able to customize and tried to sweeten it up with soy milk and cinnamon, but it was still too bitter for me. Oh well - it was warm on a cold morning and it did the trick caffeine wise, which is all I really needed anyway.\n\nI wished I could have made it back for another meal, because the hospitality was just fantastic and the lunch sandwiches sounded equally as tasty.
