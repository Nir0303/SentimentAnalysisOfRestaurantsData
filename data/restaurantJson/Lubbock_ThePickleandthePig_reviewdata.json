I assure you that we will take care from this point forward to be aware of, and avoid any fatty-chewy content.

Our partnership with The Legacy and the YWCA means that we are literally a \"pop up restaurant\" that tears down daily to allow events to go on in the space. With that- you are correct sir, we are indeed limited in our d\u00e9cor options by design for our staffs sake to simplify their (as you can imagine) rigorous closing duties. However we feel very blessed to have the opportunity to offer unique gourmet sandwich shop in the heart of downtown Lubbock. \nThank you again for joining us, and taking the time to write on our behalf!", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-02-16T13:55:34-0500", "id": "348307744"}, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-02-08T11:50:45-0500", "location_id": "8845233", "id": "345923763", "user": {"username": "JohnnyTTexas", "user_location": {"name": "Texas", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Sandwiches on homemade bread!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56208-d8845233-r328840916-m11068-The_Pickle_and_the_Pig-Lubbock_Texas.html#review328840916", "text": "Husband and I ate here not too long after they opened, on a Friday. They were packed. His meatball sandwich was really good with a refreshingly different carrot marinara--and the meatballs were stuffed with cheese--and my vegetarian sandwich (can't remember the name) was a LOT of food. We split a side of green chile mac-n-cheese. So good! All the bread is homemade and very tasty. The jalapeno cheese hoagie is covered in cheddar and jalapenos. Waffle chips are different. It's community-style seating, which is fun for Lubbock. \n\nGreat addition to downtown lunch dining.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-24T09:11:29-0500", "location_id": "8845233", "id": "328840916", "user": {"username": "HillCountryDiner", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}]}
