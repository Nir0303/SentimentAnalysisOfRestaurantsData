He had all the older women at the front of the cart all riled up and upset at us and we were so upset at the situation and the men were still following us. He did not handle the situation well at all and we did not feel safe. We elected to leave at the next stop, telling Kevin that we were going to stop the tour at that point. When I called on Monday to speak to a manager, he told me that Kevin wrote up a report that stated we were kicked off the tour.
