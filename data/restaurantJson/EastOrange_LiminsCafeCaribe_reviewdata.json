I have been going to this place for years. I had their curry shrimp with buss up. I find it hard to eat a regular roti skin since I have been introduced to buss up.

I highly recommend this place to all who crave food from the islands.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-06T16:11:13-0500", "location_id": "4695380", "id": "338025114", "user": {"username": "daoriginal101", "user_location": {"name": "Union, New Jersey", "id": "46878"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Trinidad Food and more ...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46403-d4695380-r328797530-m11068-Limin_s_Cafe_Caribe-East_Orange_New_Jersey.html#review328797530", "text": "Well I have never left this restaurant without spending over $50.00.  It is very reasonable but I always seem to buy a lot because the food is so good.  Try the curry chicken meals.  I love the Roti, Aloe Pie (with everything on it) and the baked goods.  You cannot go wrong with any of the lunch daily specials.  If you are adventurous -- try the stewed oxtail or fried shark sandwich.  As part of my last supper -- the \"FLOAT\" will definitely be included.  It is a fried bread that is used for sandwiches.
