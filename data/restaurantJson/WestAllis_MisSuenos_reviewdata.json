He really wanted to like this place but did not like his burrito. He also noted his food was very bland. His burrito wasn't even hot. It was just chicken rolled inside a tortilla with cheese on top. Cheese was even rubbery in both our dishes. Rice and beans were also cold. Rice was like the Rice-A-Roni kind. There was the end slice of a tomato on his plate as a garnish. Both our entrees came with a side of guacamole that was a little more on the brown side.\n\nOur waitress was great though. She was very kind, helpful, and there when we needed anything.
