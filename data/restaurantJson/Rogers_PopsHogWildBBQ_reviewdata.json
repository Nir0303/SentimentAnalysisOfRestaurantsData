A great lunch spot that provides a nice meal to the consumer. The pulled pork sandwich is one of my favorite bbq items. Seasoned and smoked right with a good amount of moisture in the pork. Pop's offers something unique that most of the BBQ restaurants in this area do not offer: smoked tri tip. While they do not serve brisket, the tri tip is a nice alternative that is sliced thick with the right amount of smoke. Pop's has a couple of sandwich combos that make an excellent lunch. I enjoy sitting outside on nice day. Certainly worth trying if in the Rogers, AR area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-05T07:37:42-0400", "location_id": "9829790", "id": "370425590", "user": {"username": "BulletBob7", "user_location": {"name": "Bentonville, Arkansas", "id": "31441"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Smoked Perfection", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31892-d9829790-r358473851-m11068-Pop_s_Hog_Wild_BBQ-Rogers_Arkansas.html#review358473851", "text": "The tri-tip is perfectly cooked to a medium rare finish and the pulled pork required no sauce, the way BBQ was meant to be.\n\nThe location is at an old service station and is a fun and friendly place to hangout.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-25T09:24:09-0400", "location_id": "9829790", "id": "358473851", "user": {"username": "Travis W", "user_location": {"name": "Lowell, Arkansas", "id": "31747"}}}]}
