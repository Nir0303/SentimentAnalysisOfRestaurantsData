It is modern, clean and tastefully decorated.  I visited for my 3rd time and came with a reservation.  As promised in our last review, we ordered one of the famous Thai soups this time.  We were disappointed.  It did taste good, but it didn\u2019t taste like it is supposed to taste.  I recently visited Thailand and their Tom Yam has pretty much the same flavor everywhere you go.  This was missing something.\n    * Tom Yam Soup:  5 out of 10 (Good but not authentic).\nHere\u2019s the rest of what we ordered this time:\n    * Chicken Satay: 10 out of 10\n    * Yellow curry fried rice: 10 out of 10 (Not a dish I normally order) \n    * Som Tam (papaya): 10 out of 10 (Asked for no dried shrimp)\nFrom our experience last time:\n    * Chicken Satay: 10 out of 10\n    * Phat Thai: 8 out of 10 (but my wife didn't like it??)\n    * Pat prick pao: 10 out of 10 (Not a dish I normally order) \n    * Laab chicken: 10 out of 10\n    * Som Tam (papaya): 10 out of 10\nNormally we get it without the little shrimp. We forgot this time but it was still incredible.\n    * Nam Tok: 5 out of 10\nThe last 2 times we visited, we had to wait quite a while to be seated.  The restaurant is very busy.  We were a party of 9 and were given an automatic 18% gratuity on our bill.  I\u2019m cheap and usually don\u2019t give that much unless I really like the place.  I did reserve ahead and came in a large group, but it still rubbed me a little wrong being given a forced, not suggested, tip (That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m taking off 1 star).  I do plan to visit again.  I like to tip at 20%, or more, if the prices are decent and the food/service are really good.  This time they only got their 18.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-02T06:24:49-0400", "location_id": "4520353", "id": "360888517", "user": {"username": "Ay_tim", "user_location": {"name": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "id": "60922"}}}]}
