She had specifically asked for us to take her to Los Chilaquiles on a Thursday night because they have Mariachis.  When the 3 of us arrived, we were seated immediately.  The mariachis were there and started playing soon after we got our menus.  \nSo, looking at the menu, there was a good selection of standard items you'd find in a Mexican restaurant.  Our friend ordered enchiladas, I got a super burrito covered in enchilada sauce and cheese (reminiscent of a recent dinner at Cafe Rio in Phoenix - though the burrito was simpler here) and my wife got the pechuga mexicana which was a grilled chicken breast with bacon and other trimmings, rice and beans.  We all enjoyed our food, the waitress was busy, but fairly attentive and everything went smoothly.  I signaled the mariachis and we paid for 4 songs between us at $10 each, which was fairly reasonable as there were 5 guys.  Two on trumpet, one on a base, one on a violin and I believe one regular guitar.  They played a good selection of different popular mariachi songs.  We had Las Man~anitas for the birthday girl, and Mi Linda Esposa for my wife.  The place seems pretty popular - at least on a Thursday after 7pm when the mariachis are present.  It was completely full and there were people waiting for tables.  As I looked around, everyone seemed to be having fun, enjoying the music, and many were drinking margaritas or beers.  We just had water.  I would recommend it - particularly when the mariachis are there.  You can enjoy them without paying anything - unless you want them to sing at your table.  They are pretty loud and limit conversation when they are nearby.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-16T06:35:12-0400", "location_id": "2170245", "id": "419147379", "user": {"username": "Wordtamer", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Beautiful Tex-Mex Restaurant with Great Foo..", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55599-d2170245-r418148413-m11068-Los_Chilaquiles_Bar_and_Mexican_Grill-Cedar_Park_Texas.html#review418148413", "text": "Best Lunch Specials, great service, and wonderful Tex-Mex favorites.
