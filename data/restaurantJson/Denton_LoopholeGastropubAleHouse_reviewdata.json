The interior has so many decades of smoke fog permeating everything in the place that even when it's not busy, the place smells pretty unpleasant....like the clothes you might wear out on a Friday night of drinking, smoking and otherwise having a good time....All this said, it's otherwise a great place to hang out. They welcome large parties and the staff does their best to serve up drinks and food in a timely manner. Just don't go expecting a food experience first - it's not that kind of place.
