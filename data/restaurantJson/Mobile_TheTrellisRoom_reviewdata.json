My mom had always wanted to try it and I figured what a better time than Christmas? We got off to a disappointing start, I was told during making reservations that they would give me a key so I could take my mom to the top floor to see the view, however when I asked for one upon arrival they said it was closed for maintenance. Then we proceeded to brunch where I hoped things would get better and they had so it would seem. The complimentary  mimosa's, the bread and butter, even the appetizers were all wonderful then came the entrees, my mom had the prime rib which looked great but was chewy and hard to cut, then my entr\u00e9e of scallops that were so salty I could only eat one (and I like salt) the only good entr\u00e9e was my husbands chicken. The manager (I think) came by and asked about our entrees my mom kept her mouth shut about the prime rib, but I did however tell him about my scallops he apologized and thanked me for letting him know but did not offer to have the dish remade so I simply didn't eat this course. And then there was the problem with the wait staff very nice girls not rude at all just very inexperienced, at one point my husband had to help hold the tray of soup to keep it from spilling on him, we also had to move things on the table so she could sit the tray on the table to serve us other wise the food would have been on the floor, all of this for a 3 top. Please know that I am grateful they chose to work on Christmas and I tipped them well regardless but when one pays this much money for dinner they kind of expect it to be good. All that being said the bad execution of the entrees combined with the lack of experience of the wait staff, and not being able to take my mom to the balcony, I doubt we will return here again.

This is being repaired as we speak and should be completed by the first of next week.  Once repaired, you are welcome to stop by the hotel any time and gain access to this area.  I would also like to offer you my sincere apologies for the quality of food you received and the lack of experience that was shown by some of the wait staff you encountered.  I have forwarded your review to the hotel's Director of Outlets and to the B&F Manager for their review and follow up.  I appreciate you taking the time to send in your feedback so that we may follow up and correct these issues.  \n\nWe appreciate you choosing the Battle House Hotel & Spa and Trellis Room Restaurant as your place to share the holidays with your family.
