Wine and Waffles?  Yup.  Turns out to be a very cute/hip place, albeit pretty small. There were a couple of guys playing music and singing jazz tunes, and a very cozy atmosphere.\nThe eating menu is small, a few salads, and some waffle dishes that seem perhaps to be pulled from the Ollie's Waffle shop next door.  Among the things we had were chicken and waffle sliders, a waffle avocado lettuce & tomato, and some kind of banana dessert, along with a decent Zin to drink with it.  Fun place in downtown to stop in  and have a light bite and a drink.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-11T21:42:48-0400", "location_id": "8649904", "id": "363525018", "user": {"username": "Rappongi27", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Best Happy Hour Special, Best Date Location, Best Hostess (aka Mandie)", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29073-d8649904-r339774588-m11068-Wine_and_waffles-Alameda_California.html#review339774588", "text": "Love this place!!! \n\nThe food is amazing\n- must try the mac and cheese\n- the chicken an waffles with the whiskey syrup is yummie!!\n\nThe host is amazing and the wine flights are to die for...LOVE IT!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-13T14:42:40-0500", "location_id": "8649904", "id": "339774588", "user": {"username": "Mcloven88", "user_location": {"name": "Oakland, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Go elsewhere for your wine", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29073-d8649904-r336826228-m11068-Wine_and_waffles-Alameda_California.html#review336826228", "text": "Very average wine so go to other places in Alameda for your wine.

The staff are mostly pretty knowledgeable on the wines they have and the atmosphere is very relaxed and inviting.\n\nThe prices are fairly average and the waffles, I mean come on, they're delicious!  They're thinner than I necessarily expected but with all the toppings they're still delicious.  I've tried several.\n\nI wish the menu was a little less fancy - I don't like spicy foods and the chicken had pepper flakes in the batter that the server didn't know about when I went in once, but I'm sure that's not a problem for most people.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that I wish they had more sweet wines - Moscotos, Rieslings, etc. - on the menu.  It's very red heavy so even just some other whites on the sweeter side might be nice.
