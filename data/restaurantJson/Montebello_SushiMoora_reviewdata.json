It turns out it's the best local sushi place around (maybe that's not saying much for the selection in Montebello but this place is loads better than the sushi place at the mall). Not the greatest ambiance but not bad, either. A little cramped in terms of how packed in it can get. Prices are reasonable and they have a great selection of creative rolls. Dynamite rolls, modified California rolls... plenty of spicy tuna. The noodle dishes (udon) and plates (Korean beef) are also fairly good. The draft beer is great value for money!
