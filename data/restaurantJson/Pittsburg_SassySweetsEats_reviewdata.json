I'm not sure how either acclaim was garnered based on the mediocre cupcakes we purchased.  The Lemon was dry, Red Velvet was decent, Oreo was stale, Pumpkin barely had flavor, and the bread pudding was pedestrian.  Their signature \"pancakes and bacon\" was good, not outstanding.  The service was efficient but just plain bizarre. Once home, and about half of the cupcakes sampled, we decided to not waste another of our cheat-day calories on cupcakes that could have been purchased at a supermarket.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-24T16:53:12-0400", "location_id": "4818861", "id": "421899476", "user": {"username": "cooldaddyd", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32895-d4818861-r389916300-m11068-Sassy_Sweets_Eats-Pittsburg_California.html#review389916300", "text": "I first off want to say how disappointed I am in this company from the first phone call this company has been nothing but HORRIBLE, I have called over 5 times and never once have gotten to talk to MO the owner she didn't even care to give me the time of day  !Never do business with a them !! Its sad I'm getting married in 1 month and haven't gotten a call back from the owner in over a month and a half she hadn't even give me price quote but I had to pay the deposit (which I'm not getting back) now I have to scramble to find a baker. So to all the people looking for someone to bake your cake or cupcakes for your special event DO NOT GO HERE !!! I want to thank Mo for doing me the favor by not having to deal with the company for the wedding I most definitely do not want this type of customer service for something that is going to be a big event in my lifetime I want a company to care about its customers.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-07-06T16:27:21-0400", "location_id": "4818861", "id": "389916300", "user": {"username": "drea_1990", "user_location": {"name": "Pittsburg, California", "id": "32895"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great tasty treat ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32895-d4818861-r383816792-m11068-Sassy_Sweets_Eats-Pittsburg_California.html#review383816792", "text": "I love their cupcakes, haven't tried their breakfast.
