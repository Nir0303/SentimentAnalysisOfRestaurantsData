I paid $110 for this cake which I bought for my sons first birthday party. $40 of that price was meant to be the cost of 2 FONDANT figurines at $20 a piece that she was supposed to make. When the cake was picked up there were these two cheap plastic toys where the fondant figurines were supposed to be. The owner of the company said NOTHING about it to my friend who picked up the cake - not even so much as an apology or explanation - nor did she call me AT ANY TIME to discuss an issue with making the fondant figurines and to see if there was anything that could be done or to offer me a partial refund since she was not going to make the fondant figurines. When I saw the cake and called her LIVID she actually defended her actions saying that that had \"tried to make the fondant figurines, but that they didn't like the way they turned out so they bought these instead. (MEANWHILE SHE IS POSTING PICTURE AFTER PICTURE OF CAKES WITH PERFECT FONDANT FIGURINES - YOU CANT CONVINCE ME SHE COULD NOT PRODUCE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A FONDANT MIKE WAZOWSKI!!!! - my guess is she ran out of time - forgot or just couldn't have been bothered) And since the contract says that they could take 'artistic liberties' that there was actually no problem charging me $40 for these two cheap plastic toys\". I MEAN WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! I explained to her that 'artistic liberties' does not mean you get to charge me exorbitant amounts of money for cheap toys (which sounds more like FRAUD to me) at which point she offered me STORE CREDIT for the difference. At first she offered me $15 back on the $40 I paid explaining that her store policy was no refunds. After I explained that she failed to deliver the product that I paid for she then offered me $20. Long story short I ended up getting only a $20 refund. ALSO I ordered an eyeball cupcake which was supposed to me made with ICING not fondant. I explained to her at the time of purchase that it would be my sons smash cake and that I didn't think he would enjoy the taste of fondant - the cupcake came with a thick layer of fondant and was dry and flavorless. Moms know that the smash cake is a HUGE deal for a first birthday party and this one will forever be ruined...on top of that the lady absolutely did not care one bit that I was not happy nor did she at any time admit that what she did was unethical or in any way wrong. I think the only reason she even gave me back the $20 that she did was because she wanted me off the phone.
