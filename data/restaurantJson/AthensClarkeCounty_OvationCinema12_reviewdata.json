They had menus at each seat and you can call for the server whenever you want to order. Our server was Devon and she was very friendly and prompt. The food went beyond my expectations for theater food. I got the Blues Brothers burger and my husband got the Three Amigos burger. Both had amazing flavor and the portions were generous. The French fries were especially good. The prices were a little pricey ($12 for burgers and $9 for drinks) but the quality and presentation of food was worth it. Soft drinks were also free refills ($4.50). The only complaint I have was the lighting was poor. I could barely read the menu and had to use my phone to assist. It was also a little disconcerting to be eating food you can barely see. The waitresses/ waiters were a little distracting serving people and handing out checks during the movie but they did a good job of being as discreet as they could.

Wide row spacing is great for kids who have a hard time staying in a seat and that alone will bring us back. Our first visit was very frustrating. It's one of those places where you have no idea what's going on unless you have been before. Standing in line with three kids I had to buy tickets and choose which seats we would have even though I'd never been in the theater and had no idea what the seats were like. Three clerks had three different opinions and it turned out not to matter anyway because the theater was mostly empty. You have to get there early if you want popcorn or food because you don't order in the lobby (they should change this). We got there 10 minutes early and the theater was dark. There is a light behind your shoulder, but it emits a 6\" circle of dim light making it awkward to see the full sized menu, having to turn 90 degrees to look at it and bumping the person next to you with the menu. The server comes rushing in for your order because the movie is about to begin and you still have no idea what you want. We got popcorn because we couldn't see the menu. I didn't realize the servers would take orders throughout the film, so there was no rush. The server dropped off my check at the climax of the movie and I couldn't read it because of the aforementioned lack of light. When I finally did look he had over charged us $5 and I had to track him down in the hall and wait for a manager to help while my active kiddo ran up and down the hall and sullen tweens glared menacingly. Luckily no other patrons were harmed during this time. Then I had to leave a tip even though the service was weird and imperfect - by design, not the server's fault.
