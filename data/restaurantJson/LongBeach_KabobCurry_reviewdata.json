Very plain interior, they do a special every day which is quite tasty, good thing is that there is a fairly limited menu which suggests to me a good decision not trying to do too much and whilst they claim to be a curry house that's very much an American interpretation! I.e. they had not heard of popadoms! That said the food is tasty, decent servings, the rice is fantastic. No alcohol, and you can eat outside. They also do take out.
