I do like this show and watch it all the time so I'm used to what to expect from their rescues but this one by far was the bare minimum! I've been to the YNOT many times and granted it was not a classy place and the bartenders were hit and miss with service but I really don't see a single change with the new place atmosphere wise. the same lousy people, same lousy patrons, same lousy small tv's except they added 4 in the middle but they're tiny. What they should have done is made it more of a sports bar and played off of what this town is made of Planes, Seahawks, Mariners & Soccer!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-03T15:33:09-0400", "location_id": "10397746", "id": "379493493", "user": {"username": "Shawna M", "user_location": {"name": "Everett, Washington", "id": "58466"}}}]}
