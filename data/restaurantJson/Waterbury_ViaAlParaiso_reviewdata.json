The mashed potato balls and empanadas and potato salad were also very good. They had cold drinks, including beer.  The desserts looked very American ( like chocolate cake) and the meal portions were so large that we only had room to share one very good brownie among the 6 of us. The cappuccinos were very sweet- they make them with sweetened milk. By the time we left at 3pm, almost every booth was taken. The service was pleasant. We ended up averaging $15 a person for a large amount of delicious food.\nCasual booth style dining, but very clean with very nice clean bathrooms.
