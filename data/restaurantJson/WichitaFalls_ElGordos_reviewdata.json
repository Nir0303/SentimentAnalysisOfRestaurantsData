Worth just for a mini vaca.  Fri evening we were craving mexican food, and this place was just down the street from out hotel, so thought we'd give it a shot.

My husband's relleno looked like a log of ????, and tasted like it had been fried in fish grease. I seriously thought he was going to puke at the table. My middle son had bean nachos, and the beans tasted and looked old. My chicken quesadillas were mediocre; had better, but were edible. I tasted my rice, and it was like cardboard;my oldest son took about 3 bites of his dinner, and my youngest took 1 bite of his chicken nugget. When I tasted of it, I could not associate the taste with chicken at all.  We asked for refills; the kids got theirs, but my tea glass was ignored. At that time, we spoke to the manager. She denied they fry their fish, and swore the grease is changed every Wed. She simply said she would take care of it and walked off. As we went to pay for the food we did eat, the drinks and margarita, she so rudely popped off and said \"Don;t worry about it, but don't ever come back.\"  LADY>>>we wanted to pay for what we ate, and make you aware of what's going on in your restaurant. She didn't want to know; maybe she already knew; either way, take care your business or your business will fail. We decided on McD's for dinner.

The hostess was on the phone, put it down, went to get a menu, and came back and read items and prices to the caller, then took a to-go order, all while we stood waiting to be seated! \n\nFinally got to a table, and waited about 5 more minutes to get menus, and maybe 5 to 8 more to have a chance to order. We ordered at 7:15, a full 30 minutes after arriving and being the ONLY people at the door.

It started the minute we walked through the door. Everything from the floors to the furniture screamed wore out and out dated, but I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt after all some of the best mexican restaurants have been little hole in the wall places. We first ordered some caso dip and I think all they did was open a jar of cheese whiz and pour it in a bowl. We ordered enchilada dinners, and my daughter had ordered hers without onions and instead she got onion and cheese whiz filled enchiladas. Everyone's enchiladas had hard pieces on them and the beans were dried out, it looked like they had left them out for days. The only real thing worth eating was the rice. When I went to pay for the meals they asked if everything was okay so I told them no. I tried to tell her what was wrong and she just got very defensive and RUDE. She acted as if I had insulted her personally. I was spending almost $100 with them and simply asked for a small discount since our meal was not very good. She told me she would NOT give me a discount because I had ordered this food and it came from their kitchen. What it mattered that it came fom the kitchen I don't know. I couldn't believe how rude she was, it blew my mind. The worst customer service I have every recieved!

I got their voicemail -- they close every night at 7:30 p.m.  Que?\n\nSo, it was 7:45 on a Monday night, and the only thing moving in downtown Wichita Falls was the occasional plastic sack blowing across the road.  El Gordo's was lit up, and I pulled into their parking lot.\n\nNow, you should understand I've spent a respectable chunk of my life in Texas, but a few years ago I moved to Washington, D.C., where decent Tex-Mex is more rare than an honest lobbyist.  I always found this inexplicable, because -- face it -- we ain't talkin' haute cuisine here.  Anyway, if you spend any time in Texas, you pretty much become a Tex-Mex snob by default, and I'm guilty as charged.\n\nWhen I walked up to El Gordo's I started having my doubts.  Could've been the hours pasted on (and peeling away from) the doorway with stick-on mailbox numbers or the very faded and somewhat creepy floral casino-style carpeting (the kind specifically designed to hide all manner of spills and other accidents).  Perhaps it was the sight of the booths with a goodly portion of the paint scraped off or maybe the voice in the back of my head saying \"Leave.  Now.\" after my initial perusal of the menu found that on Mondays one can order the \"cheese enchilada special\" for $3.25.\n\nBut I was there, so I stayed and ordered one of the most expensive items on the menu -- chicken fajitas for just under $10 -- and a margarita.  The chips and salsa arrived without additional cost associated (D.C. restaurants would do well to note this is normal ... and expected).  The salsa was of the tomato-saucey variety -- not immediately thrilling, but pretty addictive.  Eventually, I had to push it away lest I consume the entire basket of chips.  The margarita initially struck me as something that might double as snow-cone syrup due to the sweetness.\n\nYep.  Definitely ready to hate the place.\n\nThen the fajitas showed up on a skillet that was one-half refried beans.  Good refried beans.  Really good.  (The entire city of Washington, D.C., can't figure out how to make refried beans, much less decent ones).  The chicken had a great char-grilled flavor with distinct grill marks and was fantastically moist.  The tortillas were steaming hot and the guacamole was the basic pure chunky and super fresh variety that made the dish famous in the first place.  Nothing experimental, weird or slimy, just great guacamole made the way it's supposed to be.  I also got about a tablespoon of spicy pico de gallo in a little plastic container (tasty, but I could've used a lot more of it). \n\nThe fajitas imparted that warm, homey and overstuffed feeling you expect to get from a Mexican restaurant.  And by the end of the meal?  Well, that margarita was tasting pretty good.\n\nThen the waitress brought the bill.  Turns out that margaritas are a buck a piece on certain days during certain hours, she tells me.  So, my whole meal, including tax, was $11.01.\n\nGiven the fact my last margarita in D.C. was $16, any grousing about the El Gordo's $1 margarita shall cease now and forever more.\n\nI saw they had chile rellenos and tamales on the menu.  I'll have to try them next time ... because I'm going back.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-01-07T19:24:29-0500", "location_id": "940543", "id": "12425046", "user": {"username": "Yoshi99", "user_location": {"name": "Washington, DC", "id": null}}}]}
