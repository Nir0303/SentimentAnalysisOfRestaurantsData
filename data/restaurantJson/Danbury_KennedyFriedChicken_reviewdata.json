Cheap, simple chicken meals whether its nuggets, strips, sandwiches, wings, thighs etc you can get it here til almost 4 in the morning most nights, for next to nothing. KFC/Mcdonalds grade eats, so if you're looking for something healthy dont come here. Its nothing fancy but for a group of kids skating the skatepark down the road, leaving a concert at tuxedo junction, or a handful of guys leaving the bar, Kennedy's is that perfect greasy sustinence that keeps the night rolling. \n\nNOTE: located close to a shady area. Late night trips here can be sketchy. Lots of drunk people, homeless people asking to use your phone or to bum some money, and you can imagine the rest. If youre a small white kid like me i would be careful coming here alone past midnight. I dont let it stop me cus i like Kennedy's!
