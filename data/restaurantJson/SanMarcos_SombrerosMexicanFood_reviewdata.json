The center in which this eatery is located (Civic Center Plaza) actually has a variety of dining options, from full table service to fast food.\n\nSombrero Mexican Food is a local quick service chain with 15-20 locations, most of which are\t in San Diego County.  The burritos are tasty and filling, and I particularly enjoy the rolled tacos here.  They also feature a salsa bar with a good selection of options.\n\nEvery time I\u2019ve visited this restaurant the food has been enjoyable and the service efficient.
