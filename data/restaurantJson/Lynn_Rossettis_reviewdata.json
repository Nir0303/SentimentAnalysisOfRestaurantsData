Do not let the location deter you.\nFrom the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed.  As a female solo diner, I don't always receive the level of service that twosomes and groups receive.  Some restaurant staff behave in an awkward manner, which in turn makes me uncomfortable.  Not here!  The hostesses were more than happy to seat me, but I opted to wait for a seat the bar.  Meanwhile, they took a drink order which was promptly delivered while I waited.  The hostesses themselves, circled the bar a few times to keep me updated on the seating situation.  When I was seated at the bar, the bartender immediately introduced himself, something which always impresses me.  It was late on a Sunday night, close to their closing time, but the bartender answered all of my questions about the menu and told me not to worry about what time it was, to order what I wanted.  They were also willing to prepare something that wasn't on the menu, and that is appreciated.  Because of the hour, I chose to have an appetizer and a cocktail.  The Apple Alexander was a dreamy, silken concoction that was reminiscent of drinks I've had at grand old hotels.  The meatball appetizer I chose was meaty and not a breadball like in some places.  The red sauce was sufficiently spicy/sweet, and for me, it was just right.  The bar patrons were friendly as well, and it was nice to be able to engage in casual conversation.  I love the atmosphere; it was warm and inviting.  \nI can't say enough about the food, the staff and the ambiance.

The most savory burger I have every bitten in to. Then they add the most sweetest balsamic caramelized onions and the added pop of house cut bacon makes for such a savory sweet combination. Combine that with a creamy cheddar and a lightly toasted fantastic Brioche bun and BOOM!! I have been there a half a dozen times, and spot on medium rare every time. I must add once I picked up the burger, I never put it down. Consumed in a circular motion, with two hands and constantly looking left and right as to make sure no one wood steel it.

For entr\u00e9es, two of us ordered one of the specials of the night: the Petite Filet and Lobster Tail ($39.95).  The filet was very tender, but the lobster tails (2 each) were perhaps a little overcooked (?) as it was hard to get the lobster meat out.  It was served on a bed of linguine, and I had to laugh when our server said it came with broccoli \u2026 There was one little strand of broccoli rabe on our plates.
