They close on Saturday at 12 so my friend picked up my cake . Before picking up the cake he did look at the cake and it looked ok. Then they suggested to wrap it so that it stays fresh. So the cake went back in the back to get wrapped. During party, when we unwrapped the cake , it was split into two. My son was very shocked to see the cake split into two pieces. So we did not cut the cake in front of all the guests  and just served.\n\nNow comes the best part,. When I call in to tell them about the cake, i am told that my friend checked the cake and it was ok. They do not want to accept that something may have happened during the wrapping.I was told that 'they have a notice that says that as soon as cake leaves their premises , they are not responsible\".  It was an expensive cake. And if i am paying for an expensive cake then i know how to take care of my cake. When I asked for a discount, I am told that if I had cut a piece off the cake and brought it back then they could have given me a discount. They really think that I would have waited to return the cake to the bakery and not serve it at all at the party.\n\n So I asked to talk to the owner, and the girl who works there tells me \"you can keep calling everyday as i don't know her schedule\". I asked her incredulously  that instead of getting my number and telling your boss to call a customer , you are telling me this.  Their customer service is horrible. I have ordered full sheet in the past from other bakers without any issues. This was my first and definitely last order. I will not recommend this business to anyone. Though Cake did taste good , I will never order a cake from them as they spoiled a perfect party with a split cake.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-07T12:32:07-0400", "location_id": "5081922", "id": "380652351", "user": {"username": "M P", "user_location": {"name": "Houston, Texas", "id": "56003"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "Great desserts", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55456-d5081922-r242630457-m11068-Mary_s_Cakes_and_Cookies-Baytown_Texas.html#review242630457", "text": "Have been going to Mary's for over 20 years.
