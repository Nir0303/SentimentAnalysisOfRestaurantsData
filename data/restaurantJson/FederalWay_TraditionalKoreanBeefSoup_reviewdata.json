Sure there are lot of different types of soups but if you want Korean soup, then you MUST eat here!\n\nThey specialize in a couple popular Korean soup dishes so their menu is limited. Trust me and just order their soups. Either the sul long tang (beef brisket soup) or the do ga nee tang (beef tendon soup.) I never understood people who go to a burger place and complain after they order chicken.\n\nBack to their soups; they come unseasoned so you need to add sea salt to taste, add the green onions and the spicy chili sauce. The beef tendon soup comes with wasabi to dip the tendon in. It's delicious.\n\nI took my dad here on a damp evening and while we were eating our soups, we both looked at each other and ordered 2 more soups to go for the morning! I'll eat here whenever I'm back in Seattle for sure.\n\nTheir prices are very reasonable for a Korean restaurant and the amount of food they give.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-15T22:51:58-0400", "location_id": "3700175", "id": "310843135", "user": {"username": "l2ider", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": "60713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "My favorite hangover cure", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58471-d3700175-r190301355-m11068-Traditional_Korean_Beef_Soup-Federal_Way_Washington.html#review190301355", "text": "I've been here many a weekend mornings fighting a hangover & it never fails to do it for me.

I walk in and the waiter quickly greets me warmly with a hello.

Your choices are Beef or mixed (beef, tongue, tendon etc..) Clear or yellow noodles.  \n\nI ordered mixed (YUM!!) and clear noodles.  They bring you a bowl of salt so that you and only you can cater to your salty desires and another bowl of sliced green onions and of course amazing banchan.  The broth is flavorful, fresh, and reflects that it has been reduced to perfection!  The meat again sooo very fresh, melt in your mouth tender!\n\nI also had steamed dumplings. OOOOOHH such a lovely experience! \n\nIf you are in Federal Way and craving soup, Run to this place!  You won't find better.\n\nIf you love pho, this soup will blow you away and quickly become one of your favorite cravings!\n\nI loved this place and will be coming back with many friends and lotsa family!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-12-18T19:12:30-0500", "location_id": "3700175", "id": "147706475", "user": {"username": "besosyluz", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": null}}}]}
