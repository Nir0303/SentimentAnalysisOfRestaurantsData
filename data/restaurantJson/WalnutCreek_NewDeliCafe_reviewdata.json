The best chicken panini which is to die for. Fresh ingredients as toppings. Lovely, super yummy soups that change on a regular basis. Small and nice seating area with a lovely and friendly staff. They have specials for everyday and in case you are not able to decide they are ready to help you with the decision. Good for breakfast as well.
