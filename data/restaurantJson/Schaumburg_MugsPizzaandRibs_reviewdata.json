If you are wanting to sit in a restaurant to eat this is not the place for you.  They only have a few seats so you can wait for your food so you have to pick up or get delivery.  We ordered ribs, pizza, spaghetti and a burger.  Everything was pretty good.  My only complaint is that I wanted my burger to just have the burger, cheese and bacon and we thought that is how we ordered it through the online ordering but it came with everything on it.  Not sure if it was our fault or theirs but I took off what I could and ate the burger anyway and it was good so that says a lot. ;)  I would go here again if I was in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-08-16T12:21:29-0400", "location_id": "5104322", "id": "406298225", "user": {"username": "Ohman2boys", "user_location": {"name": "Mukwonago, Wisconsin", "id": "60118"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Don't even waste your time!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36669-d5104322-r400482007-m11068-Mug_s_Pizza_and_Ribs-Schaumburg_Illinois.html#review400482007", "text": "I traveled from out of town and was given menus from the front desk at my hotel.
