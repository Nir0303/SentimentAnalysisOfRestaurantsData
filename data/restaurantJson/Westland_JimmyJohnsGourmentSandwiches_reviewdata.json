There were some staff in training so they seemed a bit confused by some of our requests but got us answers right away. Everyone was very friendly. Our sandwiches were made very quickly and were definitely fresh and tasty. We love the chips and pickles. The store and bathrooms were pretty clean.\n\nThe only negatives I found was that there are no kids options so you have to buy them a full 8\" sub. Also, they would not sell me a plain bun (you have to pay $5.89 for the sub and then order it with no toppings :/).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-25T06:37:34-0400", "location_id": "4644667", "id": "376411064", "user": {"username": "Victoria R", "user_location": {"name": "Windsor, Canada", "id": "155021"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Fast and yummy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42811-d4644667-r300042748-m11068-Jimmy_John_s_Gourment_Sandwiches-Westland_Michigan.html#review300042748", "text": "One of the better sandwiches I've had from this chain of sandwich shops, this staff is on top of their game--I've never waited more than two minutes for my sub!
