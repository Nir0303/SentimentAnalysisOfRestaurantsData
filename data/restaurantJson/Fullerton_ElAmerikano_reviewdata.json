Both are located in downtown Fullerton and share a parking lot with the Fullerton Transportation Center as well as numerous other restaurants and night clubs.  The area can get very busy so allow yourself a few minutes extra to hunt for a parking space.  You order at the counter and your food is delivered to you at your table.  You usually associate this service style with eateries more focused on speed of service than food quality, but that is not the case here.  The cuisine is delightful.\n\nAs with its sister restaurant Kentro, El Amerikano resembles a contemporary gastropub, but a generic one, offering no clues as to what kind of food it serves.  It most often is listed in online guides as Mexican, but it really isn\u2019t; you can't get a rice-and-bean combo plate here.  You can order a margarita, but it will be made with wine rather than tequila.  The food almost defies classification; maybe \u201cMexican-inspired\u201d or \u201cLatin-centric.\u201d\n\nMy party ordered an interesting variety of dishes for dinner:  Asada Brava (grilled rib eye with a Latin rub), prime rib sandwich, grilled fish with cilantro pesto and cucumber ceviche, Rib Eye Picado (steak and vegetables saut\u00e9ed together with goat cheese and tortillas, the house fries (topped with cilantro, Latin butter and cotija cheese), and their \u201cEL A\u201d Salad (essentially a steak salad).  None of it tasted very Mexican, but it was delicious nonetheless.\n\nThe service is friendly and helpful, and the modern d\u00e9cor definitely does not scream \u201cfast food.\u201d  NOTE that you will be paying prices that are comparable to those of a full service restaurant.  Given the quality of the food, we felt that the price was not out of line.

Although the food is excellent and with no complaints about the general service the Manager on our visit last night needs a little reminder regarding customer service. There are plenty of choices regarding places to eat in Fullerton so don't make customers feel unwelcome. The specific reason I say this is due to the fact that we moved 2 tables together as we were waiting for friends to arrive. We were asked that in future we don't do this again. The restaurant was mostly empty at this point and I could understand if we were preventing others from being seated.  We were not. It was unnecessary to be treated in this way in my opinion and so we will take our business elsewhere in future.

Along with other good restaurants I am pretty sure the fries are twice fried French style. This gives a crisp fry that stays throughout the meal. The dover sole was just tasty. Whatever the light crust was combined with the perfectly cooked fish the flavor was great. My wife had the Jidori chicken and declared it \"wonderful\". Congrats to the management for not short changing the quality of the food and most important, the staff.\nEnglish Mike", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-11T08:49:02-0400", "location_id": "6872940", "id": "233784791", "user": {"username": "michael k", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Forest, California", "id": "32596"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Excellent Food, Service, Atmosphere and Price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32416-d6872940-r215239113-m11068-El_Amerikano-Fullerton_California.html#review215239113", "text": "We knew that this was also owned by Kentro in Fullerton.  We had never been to Kentro even with the great reviews the restaurant continues to garner.  Onto El Americano, you order at the counter and then the food is brought to your table.  The restaurant presents as a very modernistic setting with a great outside patio dining area.  The staff were professional, smiling and attentive but not overly attentive; just the right amount.  The food was fabulous!! We had the cauliflower fritas, the hamburger, pork chop served with faro salad and a homemade apple cobbler with a gingersnap topping.  The faro salad was everything you would want, up to the excellent goat cheese found throughout the salad.  I can not explain my husband's fries except to say awesome.  We who consider ourselves foodies went to the counter before leaving to complement the service and the food.  This is a wonderful addition to the restaurant scene of downtown Fullerton. We can't wait for our return visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-07-13T15:22:55-0400", "location_id": "6872940", "id": "215239113", "user": {"username": "segallison", "user_location": {"name": "Brea", "id": null}}}]}
