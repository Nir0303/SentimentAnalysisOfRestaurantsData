A fan of the Long Beach location, I have always liked the sports bar's open, friendly vibe with lots of windows and sports memorabilia.  I love the Surf City display of memorabilia from the International Surfing Museum down the street. Surrounded by dozens of televisions and one gigantic screen often playing pay per view special events, you can probably find a screen to watch whatever your favorite game is. We had dinner on a Friday night, my husband ordering a ABC burger, stacked with avocado, bacon and saut\u00e9ed onion,  and I tried the chicken pot pie. He loved the burger, but the chicken pot pie, while huge, was disappointing. The recipe used grilled chicken -- probably also used in its salad -- and sour pearl onions. It would have been much better if they used roast chicken.
