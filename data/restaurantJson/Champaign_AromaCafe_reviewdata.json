It was busy, but not overcrowded. Lots of people on their laptops. We dined in. There were only a couple servers, and so it backs up when people are ordering specialty coffees. Don't go here if you're in a hurry. The coffee is solid, and the pastries pretty tasty. Looks like they bring everything in. I like the ceramic mugs. You can sit outside when the weather is nice. \"Book it to Aroma Cafe.\"", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-03-15T13:42:39-0400", "location_id": "4300802", "id": "259643502", "user": {"username": "Danno251", "user_location": {"name": "Champaign, Illinois", "id": "35790"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Classic Environment", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35790-d4300802-r237973694-m11068-Aroma_Cafe-Champaign_Champaign_Urbana_Illinois.html#review237973694", "text": "Great food, great drinks served in ceramic (my favorite) and great place to meet up with people, inside or out.
