The crepes are fantastic, as is the quiche and croque madame sandwiches. As for the reviewer who stated that the croissants are \"too flaky\", I'm afraid they don't know what a true croissant is. The croissants at Aura are excellent and baked fresh daily from scratch, unlike the doughy preservative-filled \"croissants\" at Starbucks. Many of the savory menu items come with a delicious simple green salad with tasty vinaigrette that is not overpowering.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 au lait is the best coffee I have had in the Seattle area, and rivals some of the better coffee I've had in France, although it can be a little inconsistent depending on who makes it. \n\nThe owner is very friendly and polite, and has often offered to clear our table or ask if we have everything we need. \n\nThe only improvements that come to mind are 1) that it is often very harshly noisy when it is busy -- I wish they would add some kind of noise dampening to the ceiling; and 2), as with any place in downtown Kirkland, parking can be very difficult to find on a weekend. \n\nI also have a request for Aura to add moelleux au chocolat a la Paul Bakery to their desert items -- my favorite!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-09-26T23:53:21-0400", "location_id": "5421694", "id": "313930257", "user": {"username": "Ben C", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Go French", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58541-d5421694-r297333084-m11068-Aura_Bakery_Coffee_Bar-Kirkland_Washington.html#review297333084", "text": "One of several coffee shops in a small area.
