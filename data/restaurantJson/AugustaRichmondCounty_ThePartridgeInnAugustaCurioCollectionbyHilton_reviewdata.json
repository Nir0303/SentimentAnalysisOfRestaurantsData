I understand this after being in the business myself for nearly 25 years.\n\nI posted my review based on what a customer expects when visiting an upscale Hilton hotel. See prior review July 24, 2016.\n\nAfter receiving a personal response on my not so great review, inviting us to please come back from the hotel Manager, here is my review for the November visit.\n\nCustomer service here is nil. I've been up since 7am, no coffee in urns in lobby, no coffee in urns upstairs in restaurant. Restaurant under staffed. One coffee urn finally arrived at 8am with no sugar in sight. Yesterday's breakfast buffet was ice cold,no sterno under chafing dish. When I mentioned this to our waitress she replied they did not have a microwave. So there I was with an ice cold $16.00 breakfast and was offered no resolution. The buffet was filthy. I would like to add a suggestion to the kitchen and the Chef: The kitchen staff should maintain the buffet, it's cleanliness as well as the temperature of the food and make sure the coffee urns are out at 6:30am with sugar, cream, stir sticks, napkins. The waitstaff should be able to be what they are: customer service people not cooks. I believe you would have much happier customers if the waitstaff did not have the food maintenance assignment.\n\nI know smoking is not in style although, I still partake. I went to a smoking area at 7:30 am right next to an ashtray along with another lady. This was where the valet parking is, a pretty normal smoking place in non-smoking hotels. The Guest Relations person asked that we please walk to the street to smoke cigarettes. Really?? When I mentioned the ashtray being there the Guest Relations man told me to go upstairs to the Veranda to smoke which was completely locked, you could not exit.\n\nThe same wine glass and cigar butt sits on the Veranda porch railing and it's been sitting here for 2 days now. See photo.\n\nThis place needs to step up their game plan to even come close to a Hilton experience. This is my mere opinion although I stay in hotels usually Hiltons in the US very frequently at least 10 days out of each month.

The staff is definitely 5 Star, all the way around, from Clarence, who checked us in, to James and Joe, who drove the inn\u2019s van. A pleasure to find a hotel with a bartender/bar manager - A.J. - who really knows how to mix the classic drinks (a real Old Fashion, among others) and provide great service. Bartender Alex, makes the rooftop bar the place to be in the evening. The staff provides the kind of service one only reads about in historical novels - personal and attentive. A special perk is the fact that the van is available to take you to a chosen restaurant and pick you up again, an advantage not to have to drive in an unfamiliar city at night. Temper your room expectations by realizing that this is a historic hotel. The rooms are not all alike. Ours was wonderfully spacious with a nook with a desk, but a not over-sized bath that was still more than adequate. For us, the Partridge Inn had one missed opportunity. After a long drive, we arrived on a Monday evening, ready to simply settle in with expectations that the restaurant would live up to the rest of the hotel. What a disappointment! Of 11 items on the menu, only 7 were available. The waitress was unable to describe the dishes and seemed to know nothing about the surrounding area. The meal was lack-luster at best. Our two-day stay turned into four, due to Hurricane Matthew, and the Partridge Inn rose to the challenge of accommodating a massive influx of refugees from the storm, keeping pace with a still cheerful and helpful demeanor.

I used the digital key with the app on my mobile phone.  I got to my room and used the app and was given access to my room.  On a side note (and this hotel is not the only offender), all of my amenities, including my breakfast voucher, were not in the room upon my arrival.  As such, I still had to go to the front desk to obtain these items, severely limiting the advantages of the digital key. \nThe next morning at 4:30 AM I proceeded out of my room to go the fitness center.  The digital key did not work and I had to request assistance from the front desk to gain access with his master key.  After my workout, I returned to my room only to find the door would not open.  I went back down to the front desk and was issued a regular key card.  Upon my return to my room, the door would still not open.  After a return trip to the front desk, the clerk went up with his master key\u2026 the door still would not open.  We returned to the front desk and he made a call.  He was instructed to make another master key.  This key did not open the door either.  Upon arriving back to the front desk, I was told that the technician was in route and that it would be at least another 30 minutes.  During the wait I was offered another room, which was of no use to me since all of my belongings were in my original room.  While I waited in the lobby still sweaty and now cold, the front desk clerk exited the building never to return again\u2026 without even saying a word to me.  After over an hour of waiting, the valet/doorman asked if he could help, I explained the situation and he said he would make sure that the new desk clerks were aware of the situation.  I suspect that they didn\u2019t as the doorman came back to say that the technician had just arrived.  One of the new desk clerks came to tell me that my room was now accessible and \u201cthanks for my patience\u201d.  I told them that this was a major inconvenience and that I was now late for an important business meeting.\nUpon checkout, the front desk clerk thanked me for my stay, but never mentioned any type of compensation until AFTER I asked.  His offer was far from acceptable and he said that the manager would be in soon and that he had the power to offer a more suitable solution.  I gave him my mobile number and waited for a call.   At 12 PM I called the hotel, since no one had yet called me.  I was told that the manager should be back soon.  I indicated my frustration that I has yet to be contacted and he assured me that he hand delivered the message.  After another few hours without a call, I called back just to get the same answer.  From there I called the Diamond Desk and was marginally offered some compensation for my ordeal.\nThe real fact of the matter is that this is a MAJOR safety issue.  What if someone had fallen in the bathtub, was having a heart attack or someone had briefly left an infant or elderly person in the room\u2026 really any number of things\u2026 the hotel not having immediate access to each room is unacceptable at the least, and a potential lawsuit waiting to happen.\nTo date I have yet to be contacted by the hotel.  I have given this hotel every opportunity to make things right, but sadly they have chosen against it.
