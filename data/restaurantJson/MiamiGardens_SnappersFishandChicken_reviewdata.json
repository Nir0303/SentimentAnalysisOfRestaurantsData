Maybe it is the lemon pepper seasoning that they sprinkle on the wings and in my case generously so by request. If you are a little standoffish about a little place with a drive thru a and a front order window, don't be put off here the service is great the food is excellent and the price is right!!

My sister and I ordered at the window and although speaking perfect English, the young woman behind the counter, screwed up her face and barked, \"What!\", \"What!\".  She then proceeded to hand over the order (chicken wings and fries with a separate order of shrimp) with the change clamped between the two boxes - all in $1 dollar bills.  Not once did she smile or show any signs of pleasantness.  The staff working in the background looked just as miserable.  This place has the cheek to have a TripAdvisor sticker on the window!  Believe me, we won't be going there again - there are plenty of better places to eat on that stretch of road.

We waited at the drive up menu for 10 minutes just to be acknowledged and place our order. The wait time for the food was standard since it is cooked to order however when presented with a debit card the cashier declared that we'd have to go to the other drive-thru (twin drive-thru) as her card swipe machine was down. There were no signs posted. We had to advise her to ring up the orders on the other cash register. \nPlease understand that customer service at this restaurant is always subpar but the food makes up for this drawback. Once when asked about the missing accompaniments the cashier let us know that the coleslaw was miniscule anyway and they were out of bread. \nI guess you get what you get when you visit this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-25T19:35:35-0400", "location_id": "4881499", "id": "283028808", "user": {"username": "Brenda M", "user_location": {"name": "Pembroke Pines", "id": null}}}]}
