Food was served promptly and service was excellent. It wasn't really busy the day i went so i guess that maybe a factor explaining the speed as well. Food was pretty good. I ordered some pork fried rice and it was so good i had to have one more bowl. It's not expensive at that. And they have yogurt and ice cream as well for dessert. They also have a PlayStation if you wanna play while you waiting for your food ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-03T06:40:58-0400", "location_id": "4822158", "id": "285284339", "user": {"username": "Previlon K", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Family Run Asian Fusion with Gaming connections for the kids", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34153-d4822158-r235685838-m11068-Chick_N_Treats-Coral_Springs_Broward_County_Florida.html#review235685838", "text": "Sushi, Vietnamese Pho, Wings, Korean Ribs, Churrasco, Chinese and Bubble Tea! When you first look at the menu, it is overwhelming.  A huge selection of items with definitely something for everyone.  A friend of mine from China recommended the restaurant and it did not disappoint.We tried the sushi (JB Roll) my daughter thought it was delicious.  The Hong Kong style wonton mein soup, dumplings, noodles, veggies in a broth; it was so good.  The big surprise was the Bourbon Chicken.  Grilled Chicken in a delicious sauce.  Not the heavily sauced oversweet sauces that you get at the mall food court.  The downside for us was that it was made with dark meat chicken.  I loved it but my family only likes white meat, they got over it though.  Finally for dessert, they have fro yo (frozen yogurt) and bubble tea.  It is a cream tea which we don't usually like but the coconut bubble tea was quite yummy.  A good place to go for a homestyle family dinner, not fancy but delicious.  The Chinese food was terrific! \n\nAnd if you have kids who like online games, they have wi fi stations for gaming.  Yup, a great place for the kiddos.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-22T03:21:19-0400", "location_id": "4822158", "id": "235685838", "user": {"username": "alohatravelgirl", "user_location": {"name": "Coral Springs, Florida", "id": "34153"}}}]}
