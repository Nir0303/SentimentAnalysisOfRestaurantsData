You have to go to the counter and order. Also, you have to bus your on table, i.e. You should take your dishes back to the counter after you're done. It is not the most affordable coffee you can get in Oakland, but it is really good coffee. I had a cappuccino and my friend had a vanilla latte, and we were both impressed by the taste.
