So, my friend and I found this place by accident and decided to hang out there and have a drink and appetizer.  Our server was Brandy, SUPER sweet, very quick, very hard worker.  The food was delicious there.  We actually ordered a bunch of appetizers for the kiddos for when they were done and everybody LOVED the food.  We will absolutely go back and everybody else should too.  I'm sure it gets super busy and quite the college crowd in the evening, but we were there on a Saturday at 5:00 and there weren't many people there.  Quite the find.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-11T16:30:45-0400", "location_id": "4653119", "id": "427090880", "user": {"username": "SergioVazquez", "user_location": {"name": "Highland, California", "id": "32494"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Road trip worthy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32953-d4653119-r271678945-m11068-Redlands_Underground-Redlands_California.html#review271678945", "text": "Went to this bar it was down stairs it reminded me of cheers I tried there stake it was delicious and the blue cheers was to die for road trip if you want to get away and relax", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-05-12T17:24:04-0400", "location_id": "4653119", "id": "271678945", "user": {"username": "Damien G", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
