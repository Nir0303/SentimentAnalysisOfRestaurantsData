The lox board and either a blackberry white mocha or German chocolate mocha are the way to go along with an \"everything\" bagel. \n\nI do recommend getting here early. By lunch, the place is packed. Sitting outside on the patio is quite fun for people watching. \n\nGreat place.

I was very disappointed on our most recent lunch there. First it took and hour to get lunch, yes they were busy, but not that busy. My tuna wrap was $13 and was about half the size of what I expected (and I'm not a big eater). I'm asking myself \"what happened\"? I don't mind paying higher prices if the food is extraordinary and portion sizes are satisfying. I noticed a lot more interesting choices in Frederick and will probably try a different place next time.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-23T03:49:56-0400", "location_id": "2514483", "id": "385211324", "user": {"username": "charlotte e", "user_location": {"name": "Cambridge, Maryland", "id": "41038"}}}]}
