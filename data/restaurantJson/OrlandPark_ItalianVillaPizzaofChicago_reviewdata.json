This is the 5th place we have tried. The sauce and toppings were great! Not to sweet on the sauce and the sausage was flavorful and not overly greasy. It got marked down on stars because the crust tastes pre made and even looks like it. It's thin and not bad, just tastes packaged. We will give it another try sometime. Staff was friendly and clearly a family run place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-05T16:36:54-0400", "location_id": "4514556", "id": "415150708", "user": {"username": "CookTeach", "user_location": {"name": "Mokena, Illinois, USA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Greasy and Burnt", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36505-d4514556-r376252905-m11068-Italian_Villa_Pizza_of_Chicago-Orland_Park_Illinois.html#review376252905", "text": "Finally tried this pizza joint.
