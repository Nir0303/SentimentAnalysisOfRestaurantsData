This was our first visit and I really like the ambiance and the vibe - low key and not pretentious.  Great way to relax after a long work week.\n\nThe happy hour prices were decent.  They had $7 glasses of wine and food options.  For our drinks, I ordered a Rose.  It was refreshing, had a balanced acidity and a smooth finish.  For food, We ordered off the regular menu and shared a salad and the cheese spaetzle.  I thought it was random that they offered spaetzle since you typically only see it at German restaurants.   It's similar to ma and cheese but instead of pasta, it's small dumplings coated in cheesy goodness.  I thought the portion was a little on the small side for the price, but again, I was starving and it was really good!\n\nGreat experience for a first visit and would definitely go back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-29T14:51:56-0500", "location_id": "7345263", "id": "343656959", "user": {"username": "maria c", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "If you miss this, you miss something very special!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32810-d7345263-r278312931-m11068-Downtown_Wine_Merchants-Oakland_California.html#review278312931", "text": "This is a fantastic place to bring friends to lunch in downtown Oakland.  First, the food was outstanding.  We ordered the market greens salad and the chopped salad, the lamb chops, the shrimp with green and red tomatoes flatbread, slow cooked pork with Granny Smith apples & carmelized onions flatbread, and a fantastic cheese plate.  Every crumb was consumed.  Each dish was well conceived and confidently executed.  Yet, the best dish was the figs with prosciutto ham and cheese - whoa!  Yum!  That one was eaten under a minute by 5 of us.\n\nThe service is excellent and caring.  The atmosphere is elegant yet comfortable.  It's located above the 12th Street Bart and in front of the beautiful green lawn in front of the City Hall stairs.  If you are coming to see a show at the Oakland Fox, the Paramount, the Awakening Cafe or the Sound Room, this is the perfect place to grab a delicious bite and taste amazing wines.  Or if you come for lunch, you can browse Oaklandish, the well curated Laurel bookstore, and other charming local Oakland stores.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-06T09:42:50-0400", "location_id": "7345263", "id": "278312931", "user": {"username": "Margaret H", "user_location": {"name": "Oakland, California", "id": "32810"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Wine Bar + Wine Merchant with a lot of interesting, small production wines", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32810-d7345263-r254986678-m11068-Downtown_Wine_Merchants-Oakland_California.html#review254986678", "text": "Oakland, from Uptown down Broadway to Downtown and Jack London Square, is becoming a great beer and wine trail, with the likes of Diving Dog Brewhouse, The Trappist, Beer Revolution, Campovida, Independent Brewing Company, and several more all within walking distance.
