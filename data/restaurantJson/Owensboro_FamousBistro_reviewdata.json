Originally more heavy on Greek influences, it seems to have notched that back. The menu for lunch is heavy on sandwiches (including grinders and gyros) and pizza, but offers some salads, excellent soups and a few Greek dishes. There is a good amount on the menu, but they are starting to feel very similar so the choices feel more limited. It is unfortunately light on Greek offerings.  It would be wonderful if they continued to distinguish themselves by adding even more Greek offerings and twists on standard sandwiches during lunch hour. There are a lot of sandwich places, so having something unique is a good thing. Four of us were there for lunch recently and each ordered different items. Those that ordered grinders said they came out hot and flavorful, but were a little shy on the contents leaving a lot of bread in each bite. The bread was good, but a little more content would have sent the grinders over the top. The full sandwiches are big, and with all that bread require a big appetite. A 1/2 may be perfect for those less hungry.  We had phenomenal Hungarian mushroom soup. It was hearty but still seemed light, and the flavors were rich and deep. I could get a bowl rather than a cup and still want more, but the cup was just right.  We also had a chicken soup chock full of chicken and pasta. I had a small Greek salad with add on shrimp. It was tiny rather than small, so take note if you are hungry. The shrimp add on was 3 shrimp. The salad was crisp, the dressimg was nice and tart, and the feta was in a block and had a terrific texture that allowed you to chunk it up in sizes to your liking. Good salad. The shrimp was cooked fine, but were small and really added nothing to the salad. The lunch crowd is heavy, and even with outside seating the Bistro can fill up, so reservations for 11:30-1 are a good idea. The Bistro's evening menu is also good, and the atmosphere is cozy. But having even more Greek offerings would continue to allow it to distinguish itself at dinner, too.  This place is consistently good and should stay on everyone's radar. Visitors really enjoy having independent restaurant options when they come, and definitely enjoy having those that offer more global flavors.
