We were sadly disappointed. Our server almost seemed like we were bothering her by even being there. She brought us a food menu and a tablet with the wine menu. They had a few house specialties that were good prices and sounded like something we would like. However, when my husband tried to order, 2 out of the 3 he was interested in actually weren't available. He ordered the 3rd and when it came, it was in the tiniest glass we've ever seen - granted, dessert wines are often small pours, but this seemed even smaller than normal. We ordered empanadas and bacon wrapped shrimp skewers. The empanadas were pretty good, but I strongly suspect they were pre-made and only fried there. The shrimp were flavorless and rubbery, while the bacon around them was undercooked. We had already decided we were not going to order anything else, so when our server came, we told her we were ready for our check. She went to get the tablet and came back and showed us what she had charged us for. I went to my purse to get cash while she stood there awkwardly at the table -they already have the Square device plugged in at this point and clearly expect you to pay with credit. I handed her my cash and she looked a bit confused for a second, but then took it back to the bar area to get my change. She came back in just a few seconds and said they couldn't accept cash today because the owners didn't get cash from the bank (or something to that effect). My husband asked what they would do if we didn't have a credit card and she just smirked. The app led you to pre-selected tipping amounts (with your server standing over you the whole time), or you can choose a smaller button if you want to customize your tip amount. Our bill was not small and we walked out with a very bad taste in our mouth for this place. Won't be back next time we're in the area and hopefully we save someone else from this unpleasant experience.
