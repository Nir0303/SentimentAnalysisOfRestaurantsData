Closer to home, you will find historic homes in Illinois--in Cairo, Alton, Elizabethtown, Quincy, Galena, Aurora, Paris and Bloomington. Check out the William Tanner House Museum at 304 Oak Avenue in Aurora. It was built in 1857 for William A. Tanner, a hardware merchant. His descendants lived in the house until it was donated to the Aurora Historical Society in 1936. It now functions as a Victorian-period house museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Tanner was one of the first residents of Aurora. He moved from Watertown, New York, in 1835 shortly after Joseph and Samuel McCarty built the first mill in the Kane County community. A land surveyor, Tanner noted the commercial potential of the Aurora area and purchased a large tract of land on the west side of the Fox River. With 10 children, Tanner required a larger house. Located at 305 Cedar, it was constructed in the Italianate style in 1857. The two-story, brick house is built like a Latin Cross, with an octagon cupola at the center. The first floor features a parlor, music room, kitchen, dining room, library and a master bedroom and bathroom. The second floor is exclusively bedrooms. The Tanner family lived in the house until 1936, when two of the children donated it to the Aurora Historical Society. Interestingly, Tanner's hardware firm stayed in business until 1979 and was the longest-running business in town.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-01T11:30:09-0400", "location_id": "5443691", "id": "388218035", "user": {"username": "Taylor B", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Nice restored historical home", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29297-d5443691-r382914167-m11068-Tanner_House_Museum-Aurora_Illinois.html#review382914167", "text": "Had an amazing visit.
