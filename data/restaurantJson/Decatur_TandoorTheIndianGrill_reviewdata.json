We ordered various items and ended up sharing.  Key is to order some of the bread to go with the meals.  3 different dipping sauces came with our appetizer or bread.  Can't remember which.  But all were good.  Foods can be ordered in different spiciness levels.  All dishes were something different for this area and good. Liquor also served here.
