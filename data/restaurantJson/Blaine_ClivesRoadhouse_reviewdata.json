My husband ordered the burger and I ordered the chicken wild rice salad.  Both seemed like safe choices.  My husband said he burger \"wasn't bad\" and that item separately, he would have given 3 or 4 stars, but the accompanying veggies and dip...were fairly awful.  The veggies looked dry and withered, like something that has been sitting in your fridge for a week with the plastic open.  I had the chicken wild rice salad that was supposed to come with a side piece of bread.  The chicken was extremely skimpy, and it was mostly a tossed salad with wild dress and a sort of vinaigrette dressing and a few golden raisins.  The accompanying bread was a tiny cold piece of buttered and seasoned toast.  Tiny.  I can't tell you how tasteless this salad was.  If I were the chef, I would likely use some kind of toasted sesame dressing, add a few cashews or almonds, and some red or orange peppers for color and taste.  We won't likely eat here ever again.  But I did see the place is always fairly busy so maybe we picked poor choices. It appeared to be a very clean establishment and the service was quick enough.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-24T19:06:24-0400", "location_id": "4997803", "id": "367034664", "user": {"username": "Jennifer H", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "id": "43501"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Great food but their service is hit or miss.....", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42878-d4997803-r365094472-m11068-Clives_Roadhouse-Blaine_Minnesota.html#review365094472", "text": "A group of us visited Clive's twice during the weekend of April 16, 2016, which was the Stick It To Cancer Hockey Tournament.  Our first waitress, Angela P was not good at all.  She looked annoyed and it took forever when we ordered another round of drinks whether it was alcohol or just water.  To her defense, she told someone in our party that she was learning how to deal with parties (large groups), but with as slow as it was there that Sunday afternoon, someone else should've been shadowing her at the very least.  \n\nWe all ordered food and when it finally came out, she had forgotten to place orders for 2 of us.  What was really unprofessional was there was no apology from Angela or from the guy who came over to see what the 2 missing orders were.  He asked our group whether everything was ok here and I said \"we're missing two plates of food.\"  His reply was somewhat sarcastic when he said, \"well I need to know more than that.\"  Not professional in the least.  The 2 missing food orders came out a few minutes later.  \n\nAnother thing: since this was a large group of hockey players who had just finished playing, we asked for a couple pitchers of water. After 20 minutes, no waters had been delivered.  Instead, Angela brought out separate glasses of water for everyone which took forever. We wanted to stay longer but with it taking 15 minutes or longer to get a drink, we decided to go back to the hotel and enjoy our beverages outside.\n\nOther than the service being incredibly slow with a waitress who seemed annoyed, the food was really good.  I had the smothered steak bites with mashed potatoes and it was fantastic.\n\nOur same group went back that same night so we could watch the Wild game and thankfully, we had a different waitress, Kalee J who was AWESOME.  She was cheerful, professional and was right on top of our group with drinks, food orders, waters, etc.  If it hadn't been for her, I would've rated Clive's much lower.  Kalee J was the saving grace for this place; she was very upbeat and clearly knew what she was doing.  She was fun and took great care of our group.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-18T05:14:54-0400", "location_id": "4997803", "id": "365094472", "user": {"username": "Hockeygirl55901", "user_location": {"name": "Rochester, Minnesota", "id": "43466"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Good Food, Great Staff", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42878-d4997803-r347156900-m11068-Clives_Roadhouse-Blaine_Minnesota.html#review347156900", "text": "Stopped by for a quick lunch on the way to Anoka Airport.
