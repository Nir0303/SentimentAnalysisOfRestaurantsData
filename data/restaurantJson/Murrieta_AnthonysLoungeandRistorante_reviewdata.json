We have enjoyed several dishes and have not been disappointed.  The ambiance is that of an upscale restaurant and the service is great.  They have entertainment on the weekends which adds to the atmosphere.

The prices reflect it too. Lunch is less expensive than dinner here and the food is quite good. The wait staff was very attentive but our waiter was a little difficult to understand. And as I've noticed in many restaurants, the waiter is difficult to find when you want your check. In this case, we had an appointment after dinner and had to flag down another waiter to pay our bill. Not sure what that is about!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-18T15:07:50-0400", "location_id": "2163062", "id": "394102214", "user": {"username": "Alexandra T", "user_location": {"name": "Murrieta, California", "id": "32764"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Delightful!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32764-d2163062-r393392186-m11068-Anthony_s_Lounge_and_Ristorante-Murrieta_California.html#review393392186", "text": "I went here on a date and was very impressed!
