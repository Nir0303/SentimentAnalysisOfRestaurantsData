I will say that I had a good stay at this hotel and certainly don't have any complaints, but simply some observations. For my trip, the location of the Hotel Minneapolis was perfect, and I was able to walk to all of my scheduled activities for the evening. This hotel is on the north edge of downtown and is quite close to US Bank Stadium, Nicollet Mall, Target Center. Target Field, and the Warehouse District. It's always a huge plus for me when I can park my vehicle and not have to touch it again until I depart. The hotel is situated a little weird on 4th Street and I had to look for the entrance a little since it is off the street about a half block in a driveway for the hotel and valet service. I did not use the valet and there are several public parking ramps nearby. The styling of the hotel is modern, with a slight retro feel to it since this is an older building. The lobby and check in were nice and smooth and I was given a king suite on the 5th floor. Some view, but not much and basically a street corner, street noise was minimal. The room I had was nice, clean, and comfortable, but was missing something in the furnishings. It was all fine, but it was large room and just seemed a bit open. The was a micro fridge which is a nice touch, but it was just sitting on the floor by itself. The bathroom was modern and well done, and the shower was great. Glass doors and a stone tile shower with a good shower head, always plus! I thought the hotel was nice and I will definitely consider it again on another trip to Minneapolis, but more for the location than anything else.

But, the hotel is dirty!  As we were sitting in the restaurant, I looked at the window sills and noticed a layer of dust.  It was more than a day or two of dirt.  Our room was on the concierge floor, it was dark and needed a total redo.  The TV was hung on a wall at an ackward spot, a mini fridge was placed under it, again in an ackward spot.  We woke up every morning to the smell of meat cooking and in the evening of food in general.  We must have been above the kitchen vent.  We departed in the morning and when we returned several hours later, the room was not made.  We decided that if housekeeping does knock, we will just ask for towels.  Never had a knock.  When we went out for the evening, I asked the front desk to have our room made up and they were surprised that it had not been done already.  When we returned later in the eveipning, it was done.
