I think it is slightly expensive, but it is good, and this type of downtown, slightly upscale restaurant is REALLY what Abilene needs.  I won't give it 5 stars because I think those should be reserved for really superlative food.  I think the food was solidly very good.  A pizza with braised beef came recommended by the waitress.  It was good, but I wouldn't order it again.   Much better was the Margharita pizza and a pizza with prosciutto and ricotta.  They were delicious.  I loved the spreadable ricotta appetizer, served with pizza triangles.  The salads were good and were large enough to split with another person if that person is also eating pizza and isn't having the salad as their main course.  \n\nOverall, this is fantastic for downtown Abilene.

One tasted like balsamic vinegar, some sort of a \"beer sour\" attempt and one beer aged in Brandy casks that was equally horrible.

Homemade and wonderful.\n\nI can\u2019t say enough about the wait staff either.  They are great, take very good care of you and are also very personable, taking the time to talk with you.  Just love their smiles as well.\n\nOk, so if you like an upscale pizza joint, with homemade crust, the best ingredients from around the world, mixed with local, farm grown veggies, bread baked that day, the creamiest butter you will ever taste, then go check them out.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-22T16:24:31-0400", "location_id": "4819745", "id": "395631892", "user": {"username": "Doctrknow", "user_location": {"name": "Texas, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Passing through", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30138-d4819745-r393346916-m11068-Vagabond_Pizza-Abilene_Texas.html#review393346916", "text": "We were driving down the freeway and felt like some pizza so we chose Vagabonds after reading the stellar reviews.  The place had character, and the food was ok, but not as fantastic as other's described.  The service was very good.  It is quite pricy for what you get.  All the sodas are bottled so no free refills.  A little bread and butter appetizer is $3.  The pizza was a little bland and the toppings were sparse.  They do not offer parmigiana cheese to add flavor.  I drive that stretch of freeway often and I think I will keep looking for a real good pizza place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-16T15:48:02-0400", "location_id": "4819745", "id": "393346916", "user": {"username": "Richard S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Excellence", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30138-d4819745-r388119768-m11068-Vagabond_Pizza-Abilene_Texas.html#review388119768", "text": "Vagabond Pizza is what happens when people who are truly passionate about the food they create, open a restaurant. You will not be disappointed. Born as a food truck they gained a lot of local popularity due to their great food and friendly personalities. They have definitely carried this over to their restaurant. Top notch food, and excellent service. I really enjoy pairing my favorite pizza with a local craft beer from their tap system. They have a very extensive wine list as well. The atmosphere is perfect. Be aware that they can get crowded during lunch and dinner, so you might be in for a wait at times.

Their caprese salad is a delicious and authentic treat, and their wedge salad feels original with green chile ranch dressing. The rotation of pizzas are creative and tasty, and never disappointing! We found the staff to be friendly and knowledgeable about the beer and wine, as well as the food. You can see the folks hand tossing the personal sized pizza and they make it when ordered so the wait can be a bit on the longer side but with all of the great starters and drinks you won't be bored! Vagabond is a welcome addition to the Abilene food scene for any foodie! They're just what Abilene needed!
