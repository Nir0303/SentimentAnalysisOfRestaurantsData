On the largest pie, I just went and counted and there were no more than four VERY thin slices of round sausage on each slice,  I took a piece off to eat on it's own, and, really, it was too thin and so flavorless ... they need bigger chunks so you can actually taste it -- what is the point, otherwise?\n\nI was surprised when I opened the box and saw so few pieces of meat on the pizza - and unimpressed with how thin those slices were and the lack of flavor.  \n\nSo no, to me this is not the best place in Boynton.  It's not horrible, but I don't think \"Wow, I want to come back!\"  \n\nRecently tried the eggplant parm sub, too, and it's OK - just again, nothing to write home about.  Not BAD, but not great.  The cheese could have more flavor for sure.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-04-03T13:47:13-0400", "location_id": "403793", "id": "199806662", "user": {"username": "TheWanderer305", "user_location": {"name": "Miami Beach, Florida", "id": "34439"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "The Best Pizza in Town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34094-d403793-r199206312-m11068-Dean_Anthony_s_Pizzeria-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html#review199206312", "text": "The first time that we went to Dean Anthony's was in Feb 2011 when my daughter picked me up at the WPB Airport and wanted me to hear Franco Corso who does tributes to Andrea Bocelli. She had seen a sign in Dean's window. She had never heard of Franco before, but knew that I loved Andrea. We didn't even go home first. We went straight to Dean's from the airport. We were not disappointed. Franco is great and so is the pizza and salad. My family lives in Lake Worth and still only get their pizza from Dean's.
