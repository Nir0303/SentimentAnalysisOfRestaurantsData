It was not too busy at that time so I sat at the bar. It is a really nice place, not stuffy at all very comfortable. It looks like a place to have good fun with friends Ok, I ordered their Humboldt Burger. It was really good. Let me start as I prefer my burgers to be at least 1\" thick. That is the way to produce the great beef taste, a burger that is really thin does NOT have any beef taste. I see so many other place that state that they make great burgers,but they smash the burger patties with the spatula until it is so thin and dry. I hate those places so much. I am a very good cook myself and would never press a burger.\n\n Sweet Mels makes really good Burgers, so go there and try it for yourself. Go with friends and have a great night out. I will go back when I can and try something else.\n\nOk it was 9/11 when I went there. The bartender spoke up and said we are going to salute the victims of the horrible attack of our Nation, Everyone at the bar will get a shot of whiskey and when I ring the bell hold your shot up high and we will all toast to everyone that we lost. That was very touching to me. Thank you to that bartender! Let me mention that the burgers costs around $11.99", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-17T18:44:51-0400", "location_id": "3662940", "id": "419636442", "user": {"username": "Scott J", "user_location": {"name": "Gainesville, Florida", "id": "34242"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Awesome!

It was good, but a little greasy like some others mentioned in previous reviews. Not the worst I have ever seen but there was some dripping off of it. The broccoli was wonderful I will say and my wife really enjoyed her burger and it looked less greasy than mine. Service was very good, but it was not very busy.
