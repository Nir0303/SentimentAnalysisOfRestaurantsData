After being interrupted while trying to order so the guy could shout at another customer his order was ready, he also rudely told me he couldn't take my order until my daughter would stop leaning on the order bar.. She's 8 yrs old and was just standing in line like the rest of us!! He kept saying \"are you done\",\" is that it\"? After waiting in the heat (since there is only 3 outside tables with no umbrellas in total) he then threw the food bags out the window..\nThe food is no where good enough to endure this type of behavior! Same food you could get at Sonic for half the price...\nWill NOT be going here again!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-06-04T12:14:32-0400", "location_id": "879408", "id": "111477412", "user": {"username": "HtownLocal", "user_location": {"name": "Henderson, Nevada", "id": "45953"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Horrible Experience", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45953-d879408-r14345245-m11068-Hot_Dog_Heaven-Henderson_Nevada.html#review14345245", "text": "My husband, daughter and I stopped by for lunch on a recent Saturday.  I placed an order for 3 hot dogs and fries (nothing special).  Since it was pretty crowded, I figured we'd have to wait a few minutes.  25 minutes later (after folks who ordered after us got their food), my husband said to the guy at the counter \"we ordered awhile ago and were wondering if you know how much longer it'll be.\"  The guy says, \"It takes as long as it takes. You probably have a special order and now you're going to have to go to the end of the line because you asked.\"  I thought he was just joking, but when we tried to explain that we hadn't ordered anything special, he started shouting at us that we had to wait.  So we waited another 7-8 minutes and saw more people who ordered after us get their food.  When we asked again, the guy starts looking for our order and then looks at us and says, \"I don't have your order.\"  He said it three times and kept looking at us like we were lying about having placed an order.  He had our receipt in his hand, with the date and time on it!  Still trying to be polite, my husband said, \"Well, how much longer will it be?\"  The guy starts yelling at my husband and calling him a \"wise guy\" and telling him that he wasn't going to serve us and we needed to \"get lost.\"  My husband is a really mellow guy (1st time in 20 years of marriage I\u2019ve seen him lose his temper), but he started shouting at the guy because he wouldn\u2019t listen to us.  I finally stepped in and asked for our money back (shorted us 41 cents) and got the heck out of there.  I really hope this guy wasn't the owner, but I have a sneaking suspicion he is.
