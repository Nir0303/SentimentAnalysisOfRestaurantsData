The drinks, while pricey (with no happy hour), are superb and the friendly waitress was spot on with her recommendations.  Food can be ordered and is brought down from Crust.

Inside you will find a full size bar and several booths where you can sit down with friends to enjoy a fine cocktail. If you really feel the need to relax, you can also grab one of several couches, complete with coffee table and nearby bookshelves. This place is very cool! \n\nA cocktail menu lists all of The Ostrich's own signature drinks, which includes many of the classics. If you don't see anything that interests you, ask one of their more than capable bartenders to make you one of your own favorites. There are plenty of liquors to choose from. \n\nOn this visit I tried two of my favorites: an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan. Both of these were made perfectly, but the Manhattan was amazing! They serve this drink up complete with a Luxardo cherry. If you've never had one if these before, think of them as the Cadillac of maraschino cherries. But don't eat it too soon - let it soak in the booze while you sip your drink and save it for the end. You can thank Brianna for that tip. She would be the awesome server that took care of us during our visit. \n\nThere is a food menu available in case you get hungry. This comes from Crust, which is located upstairs. \n\nPrices here are definitely higher than your average bar - but we enjoyed the atmosphere enough that we are already planning a return visit. The noise level varies depending on which day of the week you stop by. When we were here on a Thursday, it was moderate to quiet. \n\nThere is virtually no cellphone service inside The Ostrich, but to be fair, you are sitting inside a basement surrounded by concrete. Put your phone away, make some new friends and have a good time! \ud83c\udf78\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf7b", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-09T17:48:44-0400", "location_id": "8705262", "id": "362914868", "user": {"username": "Alan L", "user_location": {"name": "Queen Creek, Arizona", "id": "31326"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Great hideaway ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31190-d8705262-r350670609-m11068-The_Ostrich-Chandler_Arizona.html#review350670609", "text": "This is a great place to have drinks and food if you can find it.
