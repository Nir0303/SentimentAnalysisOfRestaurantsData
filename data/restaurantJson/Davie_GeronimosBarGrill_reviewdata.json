We told the \"hostess\"( clueless, more like it) we has reservations and gave our name. She looked at the board and saw the name there and then sat 3 other couples before us. When we pointed to a hightop table with 6 chairs, she said it was reserved for a group. Again we were the only group of 6 on her \"board\" and we again had to tell her we were that group. She then started arguing with us that we wanted a table not a hightop. (meanwhile the happy hour was running out!) \n\nShe finally sat us at the stupid hightop and left, 10 minutes later no server had stopped by or even acknowledged our presence. So now there is 10 minutes left on the Happy hour clock when a server finally meanders over to get our drinks. \n\nSo the service is seriously lacking in a big way but it's not affecting the bottom line here as there were a lot of people out enjoying their Friday night . That also might be because of the food, which is a big step up from your typical bar food. \n\nThe fish and chips were basic but are very large portions, the Tuna sliders special was especially delicious, the Chicken Goat Cheese salad very good and was enough for two, the salmon was a moist well sized filet and the wings were enjoyed. \n\nAnd if you are into Craft Beers this place has you covered as they have too many to name. \n\nHint: Go with a group you enjoy chatting with because you will definitely have plenty of time to talk and order everything you want right away since the chances of seeing the server again are slim to none.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-14T13:28:30-0400", "location_id": "517065", "id": "259460279", "user": {"username": "sflgatormom", "user_location": {"name": "Cooper City, Florida", "id": "34150"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "One Major Fault", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34170-d517065-r252577346-m11068-Geronimo_s_Bar_Grill-Davie_Broward_County_Florida.html#review252577346", "text": "The food is excellent and they have a wide choice of beers to suit most tastes.

I have enjoyed visiting this restaurant many times, but sadly, no more. They allow smoking inside - I refer to the E Cigarettes which produce huge volumes of visible smoke and smell awful depending upon what the smoker chooses to add to them.

Many of the appetizers are $5.00 and are very good.  I especially like the chicken tenders with fries.  The portion is pretty big and for $5 it is a great deal. The burgers are good; not greasy but very tasty.  The service was good at the bar.  It is a very casual place and I find it to be relaxing and fun for a bite to eat.  They do not open until 4 pm during the week.  They do have happy hour on weekends in addition to their weekday happy hour and they are open during the day on the weekends.
