The wait staff was attentive, offering samples of a few beers we were unfamiliar with-a nice touch when you don't want a full glass of a brew you're not so sure you will enjoy. Rosie's pub burger and my Reuben were out of the ordinary-lots of tender meat, cooked to perfection. The accompanying fries were top quality with the added flavors and crispness of the higher quality available in better restaurants...not blah or ordinary. The atmosphere is filled with authentic Irish touches-the bar itself was shipped from Ireland. The loft has a life-like \"knight in armour\" watching over patrons. The ceiling is so beautiful-the painting is a touch of heaven....a two sided fireplace adds ambience and offers a great soft chair sitting area. Live fiddle music is a treat to patrons at various times throughout the year. For many years I brought my PRESCHOOL CLASS to Molly's for lunch following the Erie Play house productions....the staffing was so welcoming....we would sit in the balcony to eat....the children were so well behaved and Molly's staff was then and still is among the most attentive in the city of Erie.
