I called for reservations and specifically requested a table on the far side of the dinning room entry way since the last time I was there it was like having a table on the freeway...way too much traffic and the old wooden floors shook the table whenever someone stepped down into the dinning room.  The gentleman taking the reservations was aware of the problem with the floor and volume of traffic in that area.\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes early and were given a table on the opposite wall where traffic was at a minimum, the floor was solid and our waitress was outstanding.  She knew the menu, she knew how the dishes were prepared and got our bill right the first time.\n\nI have always liked Pignetti's Chicken Marsala, but that was not on the menu.  I decided on the Triple Delight which is chicken, sausage and shrimp pasta in a tomato cream sauce.  My girlfriend had the Fettuccine Pignetti.   Both dishes were excellent as was the service.  For dessert we shared a slice of Lemoncello Cake which was absolutely divine!\n\nIf you do make reservations, I recommend that you not accept a table along the dinning room entry wall since that is were the most traffic going in and out will be passing bye.
