After looking at reviews we decided to eat & shop at Sironia with high hopes. Unfortunately we were very disappointed. Keep in mind there were only two people in line ahead of us. There didn't appear to be a full time hostess stationed at the podium & waiters & waitresses kept walking past the line & not acknowledging anyone. We waited over 30 minutes to be seated. The service wasn't much better once seated. I don't know if they were short staffed or over full, but either way it wasn't addressed. We both ordered sandwiches & fruit. I had chicken salad. It wasn't very good. The pasta salad side had an odd dressing on it. Not my cup of tea. After we paid we walked around the shopping area of the store. Upstairs was antique/junk shopping, downstairs offered clothing, crafts & jewelry. We walked the whole store in 30 minutes.

I found this restaurant on-line and was very interested in the fact that I could shop and then sit down and eat lunch at a restaurant right there that had excellent reviews. My husband took one look at the outdoors of Sironia and decided that was not the place he wanted to eat. Well, we ended up dining there anyway. The Mushroom Swiss burgers were cooked to perfection. I particularly liked that the burgers weren't sandwiched between thick rolls that is so customary. The burgers were somewhat greasy but not extraordinarily so. You get one side with your selection, and I got the mashed potatoes. Suffice it to say, the mashed potatoes were bland and dry; there was no butter, no gravy, no sour cream, or anything to spice up the flavor. The restaurant does not offer French fries either; what's a burger without French fries? I had read about their desserts, but there was not much more than cakes and pies so we skipped dessert. The wait staff was friendly and helpful.If your husband doesn't like shopping, I'd say don't bring him. I really enjoyed the little shops though.
