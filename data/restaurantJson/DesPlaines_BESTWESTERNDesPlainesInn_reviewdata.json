However, that's probably the only good to come out of it. To begin with, the check-in process was obnoxious as the hotel clerk didn't recgonize my reservation at first (I booked through hotwire). Show him the reciept and was able to give me a room, only after giving a fee for having 4 guests, which was already included in the hotwire payment. Then, charge me twice and so I had to come down and speak with him again and not only did he not accept my request for a refund, he belittled me for being a \"kid\". At that point I was 20, and my friend who was with me was 21 so perfectly able to make the reservation. After the next two days of talking to management, they assured me the second charge would be corrected in the upcoming business days. It never did. It wasn't until months later (maybe up to 4 months?) and repeated calls going nowhere. Every time I called the management staff would ignore my request and blamed me for my own problems.\nEnough of that though, the room was fine, clean, and in working condition. Especially for $40 a night split between 3 other people. Location was conveniently close to some good shopping centers and restaurants and also the metro station.

Time for replacement on all. \n-My rotary dial phone in my room was not even connected to a phone line. I pulled out the furniture to try to find the cord but it wasn't there. Safety issue much? \n-Breakfast was average but not the usual Best Western spread I've come to know & love. Eggs were the only meat/protein product on the bar. Of the two waffle makers, 1 was broken & the other was partially broken-no alert to notify you when your breakfast was fully cooked. \n-The hotel advertises a shuttle service, but no driver is on duty so they hire out private taxis-odd, but effective. Seems like it would be expensive for the management. \n-The body care dispensers in the shower were not appropriate for the products being dispensed. After about 5 minutes of pumping the hair products, I gave up & dug in my luggage for something I had on me while dripping wet. Side note: I do appreciate the hotel's earth friendly approach to eliminate little sample size bottle waste, wished the dispensers worked.\n\nBeds & room were comfortable though-heat worked, sheets were clean but there was no comforter-found that odd.
