Whether your on your way home from work, an outing of shopping or maybe some other late afternoon chore, Stopping at a Little Caesar's has been a life saver on more than one occasion. It's tasty, just the right thickness and consistency of dough and tomato sauce, and satisfies even the more hard to please patron. True, there at those brands that throw the kitchen sink onto a disc of dough and call it their own special names but call ahead, wait 15 to 30 minutes to pick up and pay double or triple what you would at any Little Caesar's. On eight out of ten times, you'll walk in, order, pay, pickup and be on your way home, to a party, or maybe just sitting in you car and enjoying it either alone or with friends. A good size tasty pie, along with an assortment of baked bread arrangements are available and it'll match any other pizza parlor dollar for dollar in town.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-03-24T04:33:45-0400", "location_id": "4619927", "id": "198495854", "user": {"username": "Casualty", "user_location": {"name": "Emmaus, Pennsylvania", "id": "52598"}}}]}
