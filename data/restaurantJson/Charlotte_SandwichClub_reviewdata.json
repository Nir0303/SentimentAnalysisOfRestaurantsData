Without a custom order I believe the menu manager 3 options for me. None of them jump out as a winner and having tried them I can tell you they are not. \n\nThe eggplant mozzarella is bad. No real other way of explaining that. The focaccia is dusted with herbs they aren't baked in. The eggplant has no seasoning or so little that you would think it is none. The first time I ordered it was cold and wet. I mentioned that this last time trying to give them another chance and they nuked the entire sandwich so long that the very bad bun was now without form and just a piece of rubbery garbage. \n\nThe black bean burger wasn't any better and the veggie sandwich is passable but not really worth the effort. Get that last one only if your colleagues insist on going here for lunch. \n\nThe meat products may be fine, I couldn't tell you. \n\nBut I'm not certain it is the subject (vegetarian) that is uninspiring I believe it is just the kitchen. They seem to be running a reheat shop. I don't know when they prep their line but they bring food to temp apparently through a microwave only. On paper the eggplant sandwich sounds good but the delivery is so bad that I almost take it personally. I mean if a microwave is the only option you had to heat the food and you cared, you'd at least heat the eggplant separately and the build the sandwich. The way they execute brings serious question to their manner of operation. The bread was destroyed and the eggplant and cheese cooked beyond the ability to be consumed - trash it went. The chips and cookie were good but those aren't made here. \n\nI love to give it a rating of at least a 2 on the hope that the deliver a good meat product and that the have a good selection of chips and cookies, but I just can't do it.

Many convention centers have awful food - or nothing at all available. Restaurants that deliver for lunch are not frequently available either. So, when I was told about Sandwich Club, I was excited. It was just across the street from the Trade St entrance to the Charlotte Convention Center. However, it wasn't exactly easy to find (mainly because of the directions I was given by a \"local\").\n\nThe establishment was busy. But the wait in line was worth it. Each sandwich is made to order. You can even order half sandwiches for only 50 cents more than half the price of a full sandwich. I did this the second visit so I could try more options. My favorite of the three sandwiches I tried was the Vermont Peddler.\n\nThere are soups and healthy side options available. No salads are on the menu, but they did whip up a salad for me. I also loved the flavored San Pellegrino mineral water on offer.\n\nI wanted to order the half sandwiches online, but the simplicity of their ordering system did not make it possible. I was ordering for me and a colleague, and any order over $25 has to be paid for online. However, the only way to order a half sandwich online is to select the full sandwich, and then say \"half sandwich\" in the comments.
