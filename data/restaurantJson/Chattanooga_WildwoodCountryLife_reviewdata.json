The original restaurant on Market St seemed to be perpetually closed with a tiny 3 hour lunchtime window to dine, and I was never able to make it there.  When they moved to Brainerd and started keeping more regular restaurant hours, I decided to stop in.  The salad bar was rather good, they had an assortment of veggies and sprouts with a creamy dressing.  The burger I ordered tasted like a microwaved Boca patty with a slice of melty vegan cheese, which while not inedible, was something I could have made at home for less money.  Salad with burger came to about $10.\n\nThe eating area was cool and clean with diner-style booths.  Two plasma televisions mounted on opposite sides of the room played soothing music while Bible passages appeared on-screen.  The only other person dining was an elderly woman.  I think the whole deal with this place is to market healthier food options to the church-going set, people who wouldn't otherwise consider vegetarianism, which in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing.  But the food is somewhat bland and limited \"simplistic vegetarian for health, not taste\" fare, so be warned.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-07-02T15:23:17-0400", "location_id": "834370", "id": "133311747", "user": {"username": "purpledrank83", "user_location": {"name": "Chattanooga, Tennessee", "id": "54946"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2011-01", "title": "Ok for Vegetarian", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54946-d834370-r120776411-m11068-Wildwood_Country_Life-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html#review120776411", "text": "This lunch coutner is ok for vegetarian.

She greeted us at the door, explained how the cafeteria/buffet set up works, and also discussed some of the nutritional benefits of items on the salad bar.  She was beyond nice and went out of her way to make sure we were enjoying our lunch.  \n\nI had veggie lasagna, garlic bread, a rice dish, lentil soup, and salad from the salad bar.  All were good, with the rice being surprisingly flavorful.  The salad bar has some items on it you certainly won't find at other places such as nutritional yeast and ground flax seeds.  While nothing was earth shatteringly amazing, everything I ate was solidly good and clearly made with care.
