We walked in and there were several homeless loitering outside the doors. The building stinks inside and out. The tables were filthy so we took the food to go. Mary Jane took our order and was very helpful ( thumbs up to her). As She was cooking the female manager,Alicia, came up front. Two young men walked up to order... Several minutes later a lady walked in, Alicia stopped working to talk to her for 13 minutes w/o helping the current customers. Finally the woman walked out and Alicia took their order like they just walked in...how rude!!! This is NOT the first time we have seen her ignore the customers. Also, she has a condescending way about her! I was over surprised to hear her say to the woman\" I make more $ then u so idk how u can afford 2 phones \". That is none if her business or mine(the customer). Anyhow,  our food was fine, just super greasy. We have been here before when Lance ( white male)or the other male manager (black)were working and everything went smooth. The drive thru was just fine the two times we went through it in the morning time. In summary, I just don't know if its worth the effort,BC its hard to stay quiet when u see so much wrong... :(", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-02T06:24:50-0400", "location_id": "4648654", "id": "315586838", "user": {"username": "Denah G", "user_location": {"name": "Wildwood, Florida", "id": "34739"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Fast, friendly, efficient & accurate drive through order.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32201-d4648654-r315245084-m11068-Jack_in_the_Box-Chico_California.html#review315245084", "text": "Fast, friendly, efficient & accurate drive through order.New Buttery Jack was really good.
