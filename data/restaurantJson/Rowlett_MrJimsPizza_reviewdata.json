Have eaten Mr. Jim's pizza in the past from other locations. Overall, the pizza was very good and up to standards but the cardboard was soaked in grease which made the pizza a little less appetizing. There seemed to be a little excess grease on top of the pizza either from the cheese or pepperoni and/or sausage. Had to use a paper towel to get it off. Otherwise, very tasty and good sauce. There were a couple of tables in the front where you could eat right there if you chose to and they did offer various drinks in a cooler for something to drink.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-09T12:37:51-0500", "location_id": "11807079", "id": "435965292", "user": {"username": "clinton3004", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}]}
