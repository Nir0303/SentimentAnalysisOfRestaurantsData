This is the rare exception. This is a BIG pizza. I'm a hearty eater but there is simply no way I could eat 2 slices. But if I could - I would...because it is that delicious. Crisp but not cracker thin crust topped with top quality sauce and cheese. I had pepperoni (classic) and my sister had one of the special topping of the month selections - garlic and mushroom (they have 2 special choices each month). So I tasted both and found that the pepperoni was not just a fluke - her pizza tasted great too! And what a bargain! $5 for a slice that covers 2 paper plates. You CAN get a whole pizza for $35 and if you can eat it in less than an hour, you get cash!! I'd have to grow some sort of external stomach to even try.\n\nWhat are the down sides? The only one I've heard repeatedly is wait time. I was there for lunch and I think it was about 10 minutes between ordering and eating. Totally worth it. I've heard some folks indicate longer wait times when they were busier - I figure those kinks will get worked out.\n\nIf you are hungry and need both BIG and DELICIOUS - head to Benny Scarpetta's", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-19T09:33:35-0400", "location_id": "10787782", "id": "420226452", "user": {"username": "Chris H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Huge slice of pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57919-d10787782-r417853477-m11068-Benny_Scarpetta_s-Lynchburg_Virginia.html#review417853477", "text": "The menu is simple with 4 types of pizza and two monthly specials.
