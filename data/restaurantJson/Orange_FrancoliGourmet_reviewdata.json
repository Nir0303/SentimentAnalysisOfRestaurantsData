The lunch salad my wife had included walnut and blue cheese but with the addition of really fresh pear slices which was a nice touch. \nThe wines are reasonably priced and the list is quite extensive. \nThe service was perhaps the best we've had since travelling in California, attentive, knowledgeable and on time.
