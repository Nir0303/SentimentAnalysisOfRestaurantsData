This place is amazing! Has to be some of, if not the best, Mexican food I've ever had!!\n\nLocated in a nice residential area of Whittier, this quaint little restaurant offers much more than meets the eye when you first look at the unassuming building. The phrase \"walk quietly and carry a big stick\" comes to mind. Nothing pretentious -- just all around amazing food. \n\nIt's nicely decorated and cozy and seems like a perfect spot for a date night if you're looking for some really amazing food and not wanting to take a second mortgage out on your house to pay for it. \n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I'm white -- a classic gringo, if you will. Because of that, and the fact I don't speak Spanish, I don't remember the official names and titles of all we ate, so I'll off their descriptions and let you take it from there. \n\nFirst we started with drinks (of course). I ordered a classic margarita and my coworker ordered the equivalent of a mojito but made with tequila instead of rum. Both solid choices. $10 for a cocktail is a bit much, but it is what it is. There was a small little alcove when you first walk in where the bar is located and the drink menu had some pretty innovative cocktails -- much more than just shots of tequila, watered down margaritas, and bottles Mexican beer you get in most places. \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered this dish that was basically zucchini squash made with corn and red bell peppers cooked in butter and topped with a flavored aioli sauce. It was insanely delicious!!!!\n\nFor the entrees, my coworker ordered some dish with octopus in it ($15). I'm a Midwest meat and potatoes kind of guy, so I avoided that like it was some creepy crawly ink-shooting creature from the ocean. Oh wait, that's exactly what it is. \n\nI ordered three fish tacos ($4 each). I can't remember what fish they used, but it was a good kind (wahoo?), not cheap white fish or something like that. I also ordered a side of frijoles charros (I can't believe I remembered that) -- pinto beans with bacon ($4). \n\nMy meal was absolutely amazing. One of the best fish tacos I've ever had in my life (short from a little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant on Vashon Island, Washington but it gives these guys something to aspire to). The beans were incredible and my coworker (a well versed and experienced foodie of Mexican culture who says this is hands down his favorite Mexican restaurant in the world -- the ceviche is supposedly worth dying for, by the way) even convinced me to try the octopus. It was a little fishy and not my typical style, but I was amazed at how soft and tender it was. \n\nOverall, this place is amazing. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because our server (a nice young kid and a dead ringer for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's younger brother) seemed to forget we were there on more than one occasion. We had to ask for drinks multiple times and each time he came out of the back to check his tables, he just looked around the room at them -- while looking right past us waving our hands and trying to et his attention -- and then went into the back again. Oh well, it's probably for the best. We only had 3 drinks each, and if he'd answered every time we tried to flag him down, it would've likely been twice that much...
