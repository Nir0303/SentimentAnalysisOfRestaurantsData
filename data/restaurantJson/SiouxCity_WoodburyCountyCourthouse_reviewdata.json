So whenever we go I try to see the Woodbury County Courthouse. I had never seen this type of architecture and each time I go I find something different. You can see the influence of our world famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright in this early Prairie Gothic building.  The men who studied under Wright then went on to build this unique & for me beautiful building have left a rich heritage to the people of Sioux City. It should be treasured & protected. Whether it's the sculpture of the \"family\" that adorn the outside, the limestone & granite masonry, the interior murals or the beautiful almost luminescent dome, people should see this work of art. My favorite has always been the terra cotta molding/ sculpture that adorn the pillars.
