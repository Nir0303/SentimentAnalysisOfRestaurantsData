June, one of the fantastic ladies who works at Serendipity, is from NYC and is a pro at styling... and when I say pro, I mean she is fun, creative, dynamic and excellent at putting outfits together. On top of that she makes it fun! My mom, who likes to stay in \"her box,\" was so wow-ed by the outfit June picked out for her, and it fit her like a glove!! We were also able to find mom a perfect pair of Manolo's - something she couldn't resist treating herself with. I also encountered Serendipity in the form of a perfect little white dress with pink flowers on one side. Being 4'11\" I don't find things that fit all too often - and this was MADE for me... as were the Jimmy Choo's that June found in just my size. The ladies at Serendipity worked some magic and made our finds for the day a bit more affordable, on top of their wonderful prices. If you are looking for a special outfit and experience you MUST go to Serendipity :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-09T11:41:57-0400", "location_id": "2689167", "id": "287350766", "user": {"username": "MrandMrsAdventure", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Do not trust them.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34088-d2689167-r220253484-m11068-Serendipity-Boca_Raton_Florida.html#review220253484", "text": "They are not honest and they lie.\nThey sell your stuff and then say we returnded to you.\nWhen you call and ask everyone says something different.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-08-07T07:13:56-0400", "location_id": "2689167", "id": "220253484", "user": {"username": "Kiymet2014", "user_location": {"name": "Boca Raton, Florida", "id": "34088"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "sucks!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34088-d2689167-r151413188-m11068-Serendipity-Boca_Raton_Florida.html#review151413188", "text": "overpirces and not worth the trip.  the owners are unfriendly and do not price according to what they say.
