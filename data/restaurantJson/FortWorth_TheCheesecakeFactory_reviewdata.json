The Cheesecake Factory is always delicious.\nWhether it is a couple on date night or large group there is something definitely for everyone. Since it opened a year ago it remains busy. But they seat you fairly quickly. It is a large establishment. The outdoor seating is awesome complete with heaters in the winter and fans for the hot summer days. A great place to go after a movie or the symphony they are both right across the street. A free parking garage is to the East of the restaurant. Double plus!!!!!(after 5 of course)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-13T07:20:08-0400", "location_id": "7356577", "id": "404900049", "user": {"username": "LovelyLexi2010", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}]}
