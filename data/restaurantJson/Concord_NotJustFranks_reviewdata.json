Rated a 5 star because comparing to other like places.  Found the staff even though very busy to be friendly and helpful. The dining area and bathrooms very clean.

My wife does not like Hot Dogs and makes a fuss every time I order them so today was my day.\n\nThis place is on the lower end of Downtown Concord on Union Street across from the old Court House. Very spartan but the put out a great product at a very good price.\n\nThey have a three dog special for $5.00 with a number of topping available. Only one that is extra is cheese and that's only 10 cents.  You can upscale to the combo which includes a drink and a bag of Chip for $7.15.\n\nI went with the three dog combo with mustard, ketchup, onions and Chili and they were great. Not over cooked and straight out of the steamer. Buns were good too and the chili was excellent.\n\nMade for a great lunch that just hit the spot.\n\nAs the name implies, the Not Just Franks also includes Pretzels. Did not try them but they looked good and they have a way of both increasing sales and giving the customer a chance to do something to make someone else feel good.  For a dollar, you can buy a Pretzel to give to the next customer. In the process you can also leave a note of encouragement as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-06T14:41:41-0400", "location_id": "9768661", "id": "402206595", "user": {"username": "LKNCHOWHOUND", "user_location": {"name": "Cornelius NC", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Hot Dogs and Pretzels", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49049-d9768661-r394906786-m11068-Not_Just_Franks-Concord_North_Carolina.html#review394906786", "text": "The choices here are simple: hot dogs and pretzels.
