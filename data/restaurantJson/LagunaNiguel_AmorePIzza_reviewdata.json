No big deal go get it and bring it back so I can sign. When I open the pizza to look at it I find a long hair IN THE CHEESE. I immediately call the place and tell them I will not be eating this one and that I want another. They say okay and tell me they will give me a credit. When the delivery boy comes back he has a new pizza. He gives me the receipt and asks me to sign. I ask him why I am signing to pay for my pizza. He has no clue that I was given a credit. I call the store back and they begin to tell me that I ordered another pizza and they cannot credit the current one. That they replaced it and I do not get it for free. I explain that at this point in time I have waited over an hour for a pizza and this is ridiculous. They tell me they will have to call their manager to approve the free pizza. I give the hairy pizza back to the delivery boy and tell him his co workers said for him to wait while they call the manager. I waited for OVER 15 minutes. I check to see if the delivery boy was still here. NOPE... HE DECIDED TO LEAVE.... I called the store back and they say its all taken care of.
