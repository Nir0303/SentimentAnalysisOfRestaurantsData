For the next hour-and-a-half, we saw and heard the background of 36 murals that spanned 4 blocks.

Laura, our delightful docent, shared her knowledge and passion by bringing these murals to life for us.

Also appreciated the complimentary cold bottle of water on a hot day! Reservations not required but recommended!
