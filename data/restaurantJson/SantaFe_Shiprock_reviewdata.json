Probably the best selection of antique native American rugs.  Has an extensive collection of antique Navajo jewelry.  Most unique store in Santa Fe. Staff is very knowledgeable about all its inventory. This is like going into a museum except everything is for sale.  A store for serious collectors. Highly recommended. On the Square in Santa Fe, but located upstairs.  Elevator access around the corner.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-06T17:06:38-0400", "location_id": "10818255", "id": "415526596", "user": {"username": "TrippenDallas", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas", "id": null}}}]}
