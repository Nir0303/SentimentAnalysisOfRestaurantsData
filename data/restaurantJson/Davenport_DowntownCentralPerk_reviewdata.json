The only drawback is the one person that was working was not overly friendly and seemed annoyed with us more than anything. We payed with a debit card and she slid it on an iPad and then turned it around for me to sign, walking away to start our food. I thought this was odd, I am not familiar with their system and wasn't exactly sure what to do and it could have been considered as rude. While preparing the food this gal was talking to some guy that was in the kitchen with her discussing \"having to do all this s%#$\". The food was prepared in a timely manner. After our food was brought to us this girl walked out the door to go smoke a cigarette, leaving the restaurant completely unattended which I again thought odd. When she came back, I made a point of trying to strike up a conversation and told her the food was very good. She said thanks, took my son's plate and walked away. Shouldn't it be the staff initiating conversation and asking how the food is? I would really like to give them another chance as the food was good and my son loves finding vegetarian options.

Very smooth and perfect and I'm really picky when it comes to coffee.  Two stays ago we decided to have breakfast there and it was way better than I even expected.  The bagel sandwich was crunch and flavorful and perfect.  I'm gluten free so it was awesome to be able to eat a piece of gluten free toast with my breakfast.  A treat I most never get while eating out for breakfast.  You also have to check out their gift store.  It has a little bit of everything and I always check out what is new.  I met a friend their to do some work on our website while my husband went and read a book.  You feel comfortable doing either there!!  Wifi worked perfectly.  A great spot in downtown Davenport.  If you're worried about parking there is usually a spot close plus some parking in the back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-09-11T01:43:15-0400", "location_id": "4035987", "id": "228245066", "user": {"username": "Lynobin", "user_location": {"name": "Comayagua, Honduras", "id": "292021"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Nice quiet place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37816-d4035987-r201055685-m11068-Downtown_Central_Perk-Davenport_Iowa.html#review201055685", "text": "The food is pretty good.
