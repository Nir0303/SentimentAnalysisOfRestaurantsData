We LOVE the Stevie Burger, and a side of fries is enough for our family of 4 to share.  The kid's Grilled Cheese is a MUST for the kiddos, but I gotta admit I usually eat about half of it cause its THAT GOOD!  We always start with Chips & Guac & Salsa appetizer because... well, we're TEXANS, it's what we do!!! They've got GREAT Craft Brews, and tons of BEAUTIFULLY AMAZING DRINKS (visitors should try the Margarita Flight to get a taste of all their best Margaritas and because it's SOOO PRETTY).
