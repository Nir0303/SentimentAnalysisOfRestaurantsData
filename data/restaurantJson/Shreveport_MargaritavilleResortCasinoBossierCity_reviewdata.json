They were very prompt and called the next room who shut it off (I think they were an elderly couple who couldn't sleep and hear too well and so had the tv blaring out loud).  The reason is the room had a connecting door which is not sealed tight to seal off the noise. The front desk lady on her own said that they would give us a 15% discount on our room. We were in a hurry to check out and sure enough the discount wasn't on the bill.  The morning front desk person said it wasn't entered in the computer!!  \nLesson learned--1) check your bill before you leave; If you are getting a discount reiterate to the clerk to make sure it is entered to reflect on the bill;\n2) if you need a good nights sleep do not get a room with a connecting door unless you ask for it.

If you don't pay close attention to details (or if you keep a few drinks in you) you can have a decent stay here. \nThe parking is good. The area is great- right on the river and a very short walk to a pretty, outdoor shopping center. We went here three times during our stay and even ate there twice instead of in the hotel like we'd planned on. \nThe place is just showing too much wear and tear. Furniture is chipped and stained. The sheets on our bed had multiple holes in them. The margaritas were some of the worst we've ever had. The Margaritaville restaurant which looks so cute and theme-y on their website is actually in shambles. The food tasted like oil, the service was slow.\nThe waitresses in the casino were friendly though. And yes, we experienced what many other reviewers have written- tight slots. \nWe thought the spa was great- nice atmosphere and decent prices for great service. The pool area is pretty, but was very dirty. Cushions stained, spiderwebs and bugs on chairs. We got in the hot tub and after a few minutes the foamy layer on top disappeared and we saw that the sides of the hot tub were caked in dirt and leaves and there were limes and a straw floating in the water. \nOverall, we had a good time, but I think that's due more to our glass-half-full attitudes.
