There are several buffets that are really\ngood if you're willing to shell out big bucks for a meal - which I'm\nnot willing to do.  So, for the last several trips, I settled on the\nCattleman's Buffet at the Boomtown Casino which is a good \n(not great) buffet at a reasonable price.  The main problem I \nhave with Boomtown's buffet though, is that it closes their lunch\nmeal when I prefer to eat.  They're only open for three hours\n(11:00 am - 2:00 pm) so I have to psych myself into eating \nextra early (for me it's early) before finding my way into the\ncasino.  I've always enjoyed eating and playing at Sam's Town\nmore than at Boomtown, but I guess their cutting back had to\ndo with money - it usually is!\n\nThe Cattleman's is a pretty much average buffet, but nicely\ndesigned and laid-out in several sectioned-off areas with pastel\ncolors, and a comfortable and inviting atmosphere.  On my last\nseveral visits, the service staff has been excellent - very friendly,\nhelpful, and accommodating.  If you use your My Choice Card \nat lunch (Sun. - Sat.), the buffet is a very reasonable $9.95, and\nyou can usually get a buy one - get one meal by pulling the free\npull machine as you enter the casino (or at least that has been \nmy experience).  On Friday and Saturday nights, their seafood\ndinner buffet is $21.95 - much more that I prefer to pay for a \nmeal.\n\nThe food selection, while limited compared to other casino \nbuffets has, for the most part, been good to average.  At the\ncarving station, on my latest visit, they had a fantastic roast\nbeef that was lean, tender, and tremendously flavorful.  I really\nlove good catfish, but their offering was only average at best,\nand their hushpuppies tasted left-over or straight out of a fro-\nzen food bag.  The salads, on the other hand, were good, as\nwere the desserts.  The soup (vegetable) and the gumbo were\nboth very good.\n\nThe Cattleman's Buffet, as I've stated, is pretty average as far\nas casino buffets go, but for the price it isn't bad at all.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "JustinBpnk, Public Relations Manager at Cattleman&#39;s Buffet, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to review us.

I say this with the understanding I do not eat either and am only going  by price and what they are .

The french toast had soaked too long so while it looked like it was cooked the bread in the middle was still soaked in raw egg mixture. The pancakes and waffles could have been used as frisbees, both were rock hard and stale...completely inedible. I gave up trying to eat any breakfast food and moved on to dessert, I tried a chocolate cake which was Stale!! It was only 9am in the morning and already they were serving stale chocolate cake, I hate to see what the dinner diners will get.
