Service is usually reasonably quick and efficient - I have noticed some turnover in the staff from time to time (with entire crew or most of them replaced at one time), but wait staff is friendly.  Food menu items are mostly sandwiches and salads, all of which are pretty good.  I usually have a turkey diablo sandwich or chicken cheesesteak sandwich.  Apple walnut salad is also very good.  Cost for lunch is around $14 per person with soft drink, tax and tip included.  There is also a large sports bar with a lot of TV screens showing various sports shows.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-11-22T08:18:41-0500", "location_id": "3512631", "id": "328401232", "user": {"username": "AshesToProveIt", "user_location": {"name": "Philadelphia", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "good for a minute", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d3512631-r309042887-m11068-The_American_Pub-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html#review309042887", "text": "spacious bar...lots of table seating...windows around with concourse view, nothing special....televisions plentiful for sports viewing....what do i not like about this place?...the staff and the food....if they know you, the staff is cool...if they don't the air is chilly and impersonal....and the food is really not good...salads, sandwiches, umm, what can i highlight that isn't just ordinary?.....crinkle cut fries anyone?....ugh..stop by if you are on your way someplace else...just don't make this a sit and stay spot", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-09-10T12:36:43-0400", "location_id": "3512631", "id": "309042887", "user": {"username": "phillyborn114", "user_location": {"name": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "id": "60795"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "Gem of a Find in Philly!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60795-d3512631-r141239065-m11068-The_American_Pub-Philadelphia_Pennsylvania.html#review141239065", "text": "What a lucky fnd this was... Got into Philly right at rush hour and had a miserable hour trying to find the hotels.  Decided to walk around and see what was available.  Not the greatest option in acity that seems to roll up the sidewalks at 7:00pm. But we found ourselves looking at the Clothespin sculture at Market & 15th and sawa asign for a deli.  Lucky for us the deli was closed but we saw the American Pub on the lower level.\n\nOMG! It was great.  Granted, they had a limited menu after 4:00pm but as they are in an office building and really need to advertise more - it was still a wonderful meal.  I got a burger.  It was fresh made and cooked to perfection.  My co-worker wanted shrimp salad.  She expected the usual shrimp in mayo but got a gresh greens salad with a dozen large shrimp. She loved it.\n\nThe staff was friendly and helped us with being able to see the city as we only had another night and no time duringthe day. Our waitress mentioned working at another restaurant (known for their cheesecake) which got us thinking dessert.  That particular restaurant isn't downtown but she directed to another place also known for their desserts.\n\nI hope that when you are in Philly, you'll give them a try - they deserve the business and you won't be disappointed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-09-25T06:54:45-0400", "location_id": "3512631", "id": "141239065", "user": {"username": "JustNisa", "user_location": {"name": "Nottingham, MD, USA", "id": null}}}]}
