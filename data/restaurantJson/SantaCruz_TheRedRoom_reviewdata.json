We tried this place for restaurant week and reservations were limited a week in advance and on a Monday no less.  That speaks for the great reputation this place has.  \n\nThey did not disappoint anyone in my party.  Everything was great from the Caesar salad for an appetizer to the perfectly seasoned cooked NY steak, to the wonderful brown sugar apple cake for desert.  Along the way we enjoyed a perfectly cooked medley of vegetables seasoned perfectly, and some fantastic Brussels sprouts which I normally don't like, but were amazing here.  \n\nService was impeccable, and friendly and we felt very welcome from start to finish.   We will be looking forward to a return trip to this great Santa Cruz restaurant fixture.
