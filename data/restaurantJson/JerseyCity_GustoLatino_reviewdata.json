This is a great place for a budget priced authentic meal in a charming environment. It has a hustle and bustle of locals grabbing food on the go, but it's also a good sit down restaurant for families. They tend have daily specials, so I recommend to ask what's good today and go with it. Most recently, we had roast pork and braised oxtails with rice and beans, and the portions are huge, so be prepared to take some home with you. They also have display rack of freshly made empanadas that look delicious, and I believe they even had one filled with macaroni and cheese. Don't fill up on too much of the rice and beans, because it's imperative that you save room for sweet plantains and tostones. Lasty, you can't visit this restaurant without having Morir So\u00f1ando, which translates to \"die dreaming,\" basically a shake made of orange juice, milk, sugar and ice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-12T12:44:49-0400", "location_id": "10461269", "id": "381972814", "user": {"username": "Peter E", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
