Most of the sushi is cooked rolls but they were also fun and tasty. Our server was nice but severely under-trained. The rolls are names of rockers or rock groups for the most part. So when you look at the menu it is quite difficult to find a roll you want to start with. This is where the server should know the rolls well, to help guide you on the first roll and you can read over the menu for your next roll. \n\nWe liked the concept and seems like it could end up being pretty cool.

The decor is very Hard Rock Cafe-ish-- lots of framed album art and guitars. When we arrived, the restaurant was nearly full and quite noisy-- there's no acoustic coating or baffling on the metal ceiling or bare concrete floor, so don't expect to have a quiet conversation. The staff quickly seated us and took our drink orders, then brought menus, which are actually made of LPs (remember those?) bound together; I got ZZ Top's \"Deguello\" and a Joan Jett album. \n\nThe menu features a range of appetizers (which I skipped), conventional sushi, sashimi, and nigiri, and a broad assortment of rock-themed rolls: the Rush roll, the Journey roll, the Ozzy Osbourne, the Elvis, and so on. My date had a Kiss roll (shrimp tempura roll topped with chopped shrimp, scallop, crabmeat, eel sauce, spicy mayo and crunchy flakes), and I had the Ozzy. (tempura shrimp topped with crabmeat and a spicy chili sauce). Both were excellent, as was the side of salmon nigiri I ordered. (Note that the descriptions of rolls in the restaurant's printed menus and the online menus don't match; for example, the online menu has a Titanic roll that the restaurant lacks, and my Ozzy had crabmeat (per the in-house menu) and not tuna as the online menu promises).\n\nPrices are moderate-- figure around $13/roll for the themed items. Service was quick and cheerful. All in all, an enjoyable visit and a fun place for a quick lunch-- we'll be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-26T12:17:58-0400", "location_id": "4065617", "id": "431919365", "user": {"username": "Paul R", "user_location": {"name": "Madison, Alabama", "id": "30677"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "No wine", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30620-d4065617-r427744380-m11068-Rock_N_Roll_Sushi-Huntsville_Alabama.html#review427744380", "text": "Only wine is Barefoot.
