This is the first time we both did that. We had fun.\n\nStaff are decent. The equipment and venue is good. It is indoor. Not a big place but big enough for beginners to practice.\n\nThe teaching is about 20 minutes. Getting equipment fitted took ~5 minutes. You should be shooting your first arrow within 30 minutes. The coach will then leave you alone.\n\nI felt like a little too brief. I would prefer if they stay behind and give a couple of advice or tips. May be they want you to come back for that.\n\nPrice is a little higher than the ones in Gilroy and Union City. But we didn't use the other two due to schedule.\n\nParking is very limited. Well, it is Daly City.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-12T21:47:20-0400", "location_id": "10837377", "id": "417775101", "user": {"username": "ILoveHotSpring", "user_location": {"name": "Los Altos, California", "id": "32653"}}}]}
