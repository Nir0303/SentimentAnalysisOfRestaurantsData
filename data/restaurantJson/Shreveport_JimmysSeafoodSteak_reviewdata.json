We have been to the buffet often and find it to be rather hit or miss.  We decided to go last minute and had not packed for a nicer restaurant. My husband had jeans and a t-shirt and my brother-in-law was wearing shorts. We walked up and asked the host if they had a dress code and he very courteously said \"not in paradise\".  We were seated overlooking the river.  A basket with an assortment of delicious breads and plate with flavored butters was brought fairly quickly. My sister-in-law and I ordered salads which were both fresh.  My husband ordered the ribeye which was quite flavorful and cooked a beautiful medium as ordered and served with choice of side.  My sister-in-law and I ordered the bacon wrapped stuffed shrimp. They were huge we each had four shrimp on our plates and we were full after two.   They were in a word delicious!!  The shrimp were served over grits and a scrumptious Tasso gravy!  Yum!  Brother-in-law ordered the lamb and as I'm not a lamb eater I can't comment other than to say he said it was the best lamb he had ever eaten.  Our table also got a loaded baked potato and sugar snap peas sides. All were delicious. We ended the meal with a shared chocolate mousse cake, again amazingly delicious. Overall a wonderful meal and a great time. As a bonus two members of the staff sang to a table nearby so we had a bonus of great entertainment. Not sure what the previous poster meant regarding no sides. Each of our entrees had a small accompaniment plus you can order from a list of other delicious sides.   We can't wait to go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Mimi F, Guest Relations Manager at Jimmy&#39;s Seafood &amp; Steak, responded to this review", "text": "Aloha Delicious!\n\nWhat a wonderful review of Jimmy's Seafood & Steakhouse here at Margaritaville Resort Casino on TripAdvisor.

It was our good fortune to stop and read the menu outside Jimmy's.  The host, Justin, came over to speak to us.  He was friendly, professional and outgoing.  He answered our questions and invited us to come in without pressuring us.  We were seated and Paul was our waiter.  Paul was fantastic.  Informative, helpful, professional, and prompt along with being friendly and making you feel at home.  A great dining experience.  We had the salmon, Paul recommended, and it was so good I would compare it favorably to the fresh salmon from Lake Michigan.  It was that good.  If you're in Shreveport and want to have dinner, you can do no better than Jimmy's.  If he's there, ask Justin if Paul is available.

The crab cakes took awhile to arrive. The burned the first ones. Once it arrived it was tasteless. SaltGrass does better crab cakes. Shrimp cocktail had 4 large shrimp. According to Forrest Gump if we added a couple we could have had a shrimp cocktail. I ordered stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon. Husband a ribeye medium well. His was still running red juices. Shrimp was over cooked. Bacon was very crisp. No sides were offered. Cocktail was offered no wine suggested. Had dessert put in a sack to go. Chocolate mousse cake with Oreo crust. Could have been from Costco. Cruise ship steakhouses offer better menu. And please put on your pants not shorts for the benefit of others. Save shorts for buffet.
