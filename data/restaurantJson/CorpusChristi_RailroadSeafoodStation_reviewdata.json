For a moment, I regretted my decision because the shrimp were oh so delicious! Great jumbo size & great seasoning...so much that it didn't need any additional dipping sauce.  And there was plenty to go around.\n\nThe crab cakes, however, were worth going against the grain.  It was two patties that tasted like crab meat, instead of that \"hint of crab\" mixed in with fillers & then breaded & baked.  The Pontchartrain sauce wasn't too spicy & when mixed with the rice, combined for a nice, interesting taste.\n\nI wasn't thrilled with the hobo fries, but the onion rings were decent.  Sliced, dipped in a batter mix & deep fried, the seafood sauce that came with them had a little bit of a kick to it but not enough to clear the sinuses.  Our wait staff Cruz was very much on top of things & did a nice job when we asked for extra items. \n\nI would come back here & try some other dishes, but definitely get the crab cakes to go!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-22T10:44:59-0400", "location_id": "1025928", "id": "421240476", "user": {"username": "Liza D", "user_location": {"name": "Cleveland, Ohio", "id": "50207"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "A must try", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60927-d1025928-r415515415-m11068-Railroad_Seafood_Station-Corpus_Christi_Texas.html#review415515415", "text": "When you first come in you are greeted the resturant is clean and spacious the food is delicious the drinks are great and the serious is awesome I would definitely come back ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-06T15:44:12-0400", "location_id": "1025928", "id": "415515415", "user": {"username": "Rashida B", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great Ambiance and Delicious Food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60927-d1025928-r408882694-m11068-Railroad_Seafood_Station-Corpus_Christi_Texas.html#review408882694", "text": "We had lunch at this restaurant during a weekend trip to Corpus Christi, we loved the layout of the building, decor and theme was very relaxing, plenty of light, very open but inviting at the same time, we were six in my party with kids, we ordered the appetizers the stuffed mushrooms, quesadillas and seafood gumbo, they all were delicious and well made, then we ordered the fish fried by the pound platter and the shrimp platter, they were so nice to accommodate my request to do half of the fish platter grilled for my little girl, I thought that was very nice, not many places modify their menu to please the customers!
