He rushed us to order even though it was plain that my friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to have a little conversation first. He didn't ask us what kind of soup or rice we wanted. Turns out they were out of brown rice anyway so I guess it didn't matter. But I got hot and sour soup when I prefer egg drop. The service was fast which is a plus when you're on your lunch hour. By the time our meals arrived, the place was getting smoky. By the time we had finished, it was so thick we started coughing and had to leave. Fix the AC! All the smoke from the kitchen was pouring out into the dining area.

You don't find it in Chinese restaurant in China Town or Monterey Park.\n\nI ordered shrimp with oyster sauce.  It was not good at all.  It was way too sweet.  For some reason, they put too much sugar.  The worse thing was- the rice was dry and hard.  It was from the night before.  I normall save those for fried rice when I was a Chinese chef.  You don't serve a day old rice to customers.\n\nIf you are looking for real Chinese food, this is not the place.  I ate at the new Shanghai the day before.  it was a little better, but the portion was small.  I write a separate review on that.  \n\nIf you want real Chinese food, at least try the restaurants near 99 Ranch Market in Irvine.
