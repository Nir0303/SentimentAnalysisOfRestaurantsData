Seem to be served at Greek-American food diners, such as this one was.  I was not impressed with the dog, but then again it was my first time having one.  I made inquiries of the young woman that served us and she gave me a \"deer in the headlights\" look when I asked a couple of questions about the dogs, but came back quickly with answers.  Probably I came on too foodie for her, but she was helpful.\n\nI might go here again, but I would stick to the Greek stuff.  Recommended it you are really, really hungry and are in the area.
