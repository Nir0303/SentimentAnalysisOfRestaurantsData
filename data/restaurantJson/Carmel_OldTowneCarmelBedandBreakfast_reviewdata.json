First, the location is perfect...walking distance to the Arts & Design District of Carmel. Second, the home is a renovated 115 year old home which is inviting and cozy, the colors bright and cheerful. Third, the hosts Loretta and Doug are great!  They are welcoming, friendly, go out of their way to make you comfortable and so very nice. Fourth, Loretta makes great breakfasts and feeds you well...all homemade from the scones to the jams to the waffles. You will not go hungry with her breakfasts.  An example of our first breakfast - breads, lemon-blueberry scones, fresh fruits, juices/coffee/tea, yogurt parfait, egg casserole, crispy bacon and waffles. I was stuffed!  Finally, you get a sweet treat in the afternoons like cupcakes or chocolate crinkle cookies, both so moist and yummy. I was so happy to have found this delightful B&B. I suggest trying Bazbeaux for an inexpensive pizza dinner or Donatello's for Italian fare.  While you are walking the Arts & Design District, stop at the Simply Sweet Shoppe for candy, Bath Junkie to make your own body scrub and the wonderful farmer's market on Saturday mornings. Look for all the great life-like statues along the streets in the District. They're great. Most importantly, take my advice and stay at Old Towne Carmel Bed & Breakfast.
