I have been eating at The Boneyard for several years and have been rarely disappointed.  Their IS an occasional 'tough' rack; however, given the number of years that I have eaten at this restaurant (well over 25 years), I can only remember one or two occasions when I haven't been completely satisfied.  Of course, if you are looking for Damon-type ribs (YUCK) or Famous Dave's (which is the Mickey D's of Rib dinners - in my estimation) then you will be disappointed because the ribs at The Boneyard taste as though they have been cooked on site (and they are)!  This is not a place to go for 'ambience' or 'romance' or anything but a finger-licking experience!  The only 'complaint' that I have is that we were there during an especially busy weekend day - when there were several large parties and an 'event' occurring in their large 'party' area.  There were several 'un-bussed' tables awaiting clean up which was being delayed because ALL of the waitstaff was busily helping their occupied tables.  This caused an undue wait for a table.  Unfortunately, my complaint stems from the fact that the owner of this location employs a relative as a hostess: a tall, unattractive,  dark haired woman who ALWAYS acts as though she is 'above it all'.  And of course, she is certainly \"too good\" to possibly break a nail actually working.  So she's getting herself a soda, and is standing around looking bored when in MY opinion she should have been assisting her family's business by helping to clean tables to eliminate the back-up of waiting diners. When we were finally seated, the food was delicious, served promptly and at the right temperature.  I felt very sorry for our waitress and believe that the \"hostess\" should find another way to underwrite the desperately needed plastic surgery in order to 'become' who she thinks she is!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-05-14T14:33:41-0400", "location_id": "545162", "id": "205593085", "user": {"username": "anitamoretime", "user_location": {"name": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "id": "29556"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-10", "title": "good food!! worth the money!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42412-d545162-r181868861-m11068-The_Boneyard_III-Livonia_Michigan.html#review181868861", "text": "This was our first time too eat there! it was worth the money we spent! very satisfied!! good food!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-10-21T14:36:38-0400", "location_id": "545162", "id": "181868861", "user": {"username": "sangee l", "user_location": {"name": "Cleveland, Ohio", "id": "50207"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2013-08", "title": "Not really authentic", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42412-d545162-r172881254-m11068-The_Boneyard_III-Livonia_Michigan.html#review172881254", "text": "Just finished eating our meal from this Boneyard location and I have to say that I am greatly disappointed.
