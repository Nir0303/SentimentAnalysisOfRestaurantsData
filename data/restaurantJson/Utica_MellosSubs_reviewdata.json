The bread is fresh and soft and the meats are the best.  Wish I could say the same for the owners attitude.  My co-workers and I wanted to place an order, however, we did not have any menus and could not find one on-line anywhere.  We called at 9:30 in the morning to get an estimate on prices for small and large subs.  The person answers and says hello.  I asked for prices and he says, oh I can't give that, they range.  I said I understand that but can I just get a range for small and large.  He asks \"have you been in here before?\" And I replied yes....he says then you know what we have.  I said I know what you have but it's been a few years I didn't memorize the prices.  He says I can't do this, I can't do this right now I'm prepping food and so on.  For the time it took him to argue with me, he could have just shot me a few prices.  He continued to argue when I said there was a bunch of us ordering and we wanted a rough estimate as I know they also have a special....he just continued to argue.  I had to hang up on him.
