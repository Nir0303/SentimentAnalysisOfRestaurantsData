I looks appealing form the outside and the interior is nice but not overly fancy.  They have a lunch special and I decided to try the Kung Pao chicken.  The lunch special comes with a cup of either hot and sour soup or egg drop soup, a choice of appetizer, and the entree. The hot and sour soup was quite tasty, perhaps a little spicier than most places.  The egg roll was small but good and the kung pao chicken was excellent.  Lots of large pieces of chicken in a savory sauce servedwith a side of ham-fried rice.  With a soft drink the total cost was $8.89.  My waiter was quick and quite attentive.  Definitely recommend and I will be back with my wife.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-23T12:38:20-0400", "location_id": "5014512", "id": "409661905", "user": {"username": "Illinifan625", "user_location": {"name": "West Jordan, Utah", "id": "57166"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Decent Chinese at a good price.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57131-d5014512-r322103222-m11068-Red_Dragon_Bistro-South_Jordan_Utah.html#review322103222", "text": "We usually go here for lunch when we can eat for $7 a person with their lunch specials.

It was the nastiest food I have had in a long time. I couldn't even finish the Mongolian Beef. It was just rubbery and tasteless and covered with a clear gloopy sauce. The ham fried rice was just rice with a little soy sauce and cubes of ham - nothing fancy or tasty - although it was the best part.  My companion had sweet and sour chicken which was just Katsu cut in strips with one chunk of green pepper, one chunk of carrot and a small chunk of pineapple. She wanted a knife because the pepper chunk was too big to shove in her mouth but the waiter just sped by calling out, \"Everything Okay?\" and we didn't want to chase him around the place. Hers was better than mine, though.  We drove past the place 3 times in the next 2 days doing errands and shouted \"Boo!  Hiss!\" every time we did.  I don't get how this is highly rated.
