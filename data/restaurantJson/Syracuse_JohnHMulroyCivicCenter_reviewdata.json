The acoustics are great and the seating and facilities are perfect. \nHere's my tip for you...if you can- get seats in the private balconies! Seats 1-4 are the front row. The seats are wheeled office type seats, and these may be the best vantage points in the house. Not your thing? That's ok- rows A, D, and G have extra legroom. Not inches, but like a whole foot of extra space! \nDo yourself a favor and see a concert at the Civic center!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-14T15:58:12-0400", "location_id": "10345268", "id": "418639273", "user": {"username": "mayorriven", "user_location": {"name": "Manlius, New York", "id": "48108"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "older venue", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48713-d10345268-r409785509-m11068-John_H_Mulroy_Civic_Center-Syracuse_Finger_Lakes_New_York.html#review409785509", "text": "The building is getting old by other standards, but has a well lain out floor plan for a variety of convention and entertainment functions", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-23T19:07:03-0400", "location_id": "10345268", "id": "409785509", "user": {"username": "michaelbQ168AO", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Nice theater to watch plays", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48713-d10345268-r406661428-m11068-John_H_Mulroy_Civic_Center-Syracuse_Finger_Lakes_New_York.html#review406661428", "text": "I have seen numerous Broadway plays at this theater.

The problem is the venue is just too large for many of the patrons to actually be able to really enjoy the shows. There's a reason Broadway theaters aren't huge: it's so that the audience members can actually be close enough to the actors to see the expressions on their faces. That's not really possible from many of the seats in the back of the orchestra section at this theater.\n\nI don't have a solution, of course. My suggestion, if you are purchasing individual tickets to shows here, would be to opt for tickets closer, and on the sides, rather than being further back, and more centered, as further back really can be just too far back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-20T21:49:36-0400", "location_id": "10345268", "id": "374994930", "user": {"username": "Andrew W", "user_location": {"name": "Ithaca, New York, United States", "id": null}}}]}
