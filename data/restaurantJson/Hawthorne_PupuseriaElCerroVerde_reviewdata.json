They have really good pupusas, platanos,  soups, etc. I haven't had one dish that I didn't enjoy here. I also really like their ensalada (fresh fruit beverage). OMG. I remember going here for take out during lunch. Yes indeed this place is really tasty... I think I may tried every single pupusa they have on the menu. Hahahahaha. Keep in mind that I am a huge fan of platanos so they stole my heart with how lovely they taste. GASP GASP GASP.\n\nTip: This place is rather small on the inside with limited seating. It does get back during lunch and sometimes during the week (evening) so please go with patience. The wait for the food is worth it. A great find and will definitely dine again.\n\n**They could've expanded by now since I haven't been in a few years**", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-14T02:11:13-0400", "location_id": "4465179", "id": "299099979", "user": {"username": "MsTia79", "user_location": {"name": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "id": "295424"}}}]}
