My Dad is a fan of Motel 6's because he doesn't care about luxuries and loves the low prices.\n\nMyself, I prefer fancy hotels and this one was definitely not fancy. That being said, we paid very little for this room and all we needed was a place to come back to sleep.\n\nThe basics about this room (#310):\n\n1) Everything worked (TV, power, internet)\n2) The blanket on the bed did have some stains, burns on it, but I did not get the impression that it was dirty.\n3) Found the bodies of two dead bugs in the room (one on the floor near the window, one in the bathroom) but I did not find any live bugs in the room (and I was looking). \n4) Great location. As soon as I pulled out of the parking lot, I was on the 360 and going.\n\nFor the price, you get what you paid for and I believe that this hotel is good value for your money. Would I stay here again?
