Drug deals in the parking lot, half-clothed people walking the sidewalks between rooms, bugs in the room, AWFUL! We got dinner at Taco Bell across the street and literally locked ourselves in our room. There are many, many people living at this hotel--NOT a good sign.\n", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2006-06-25T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "542952", "id": "5391087", "user": {"username": "Kirstee08", "user_location": {"name": "Oregon", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2005-06", "title": "Cheapest place in town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32952-d542952-r3624459-m11068-Americana_Lodge_Redding-Redding_California.html#review3624459", "text": "I stayed here simply because it was the cheapest place in town.  That being said, I had low expectations and I was not disappointed.  The Americana Lodge is definitely a firm 1 star hotel.  The room was fairly clean with a few dead flies on the window sill.  The table, dresser and counter was clean.  The ceiling vent near the sink needed to be cleaned.  There were 2 light bulbs missing, one in a table lamp and one over the sink.  The TV worked fine and had a large selection of stations.  The shower floor was clean but worn.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I received fresh towels daily and a made bed. The air conditioner worked fine.  Because of it's location near two fairly busy streets, I could hear cars in the middle of the night some nights. The pool was clean.  Because of the low price of this hotel (I paid only $33 a night for 4 nights with a coupon) there are some people who live at this hotel (which I found out from someone at the pool).  There's a Taco Bell across the street and a Winchell's on the corner.  If you are very short on funds, you might find this place to be good enough for one night but most people I know would probably not stay here.\n", "helpful_votes": "12", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2005-06-30T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "542952", "id": "3624459", "user": {"username": null, "user_location": {"name": "Davenport, WA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "de", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Minimalstandart aber sauber", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32952-d542952-r212332520-m11068-Americana_Lodge_Redding-Redding_California.html#review212332520", "text": "Hotel an zwei grossen Strassen.
