It has been a few days and I still feel the same.  Check my other reviews and you'll see that I am not one to flame a place without reason.\n\nI stopped at Church's for some chicken on a Sunday evening.  There was a pretty long line at their walk up window but I decided to wait anyway.\n\nAfter 15 minutes I finally got to the window to place my order and the guy told me that they were out of white meat...gotta wait another eight minutes.\n\nThis is not the first time I have been here and they were out of chicken...I tell you this, it will be my last.  Add one more to list of BANNED places.\n\nPass on this place...it is old and very poorly managed.  If you must have fried chicken go to the other Church's on S. Beltline, KFC on Story or Chicken Express on 183...Don't waste your time with this place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-25T11:36:38-0400", "location_id": "8428360", "id": "431594003", "user": {"username": "Grant W", "user_location": {"name": "Irving, Texas", "id": "56032"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Better than a bucket", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56032-d8428360-r294123324-m11068-Church_s_Chicken-Irving_Texas.html#review294123324", "text": "Like their tenders, family pack.
