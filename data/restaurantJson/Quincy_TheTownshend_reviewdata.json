We wanted a leisurely commute back to Cape Cod.  The service was superb--right from the start.  We had difficulty finding the place since the signs were not visible from our direction of travel.  When we phoned the restaurant the General Manager told us where to park and actually walked out to greet us...we were only 2 minutes away.  All evening the service was always friendly and competent.  We drank their draft ale special and our friends ordered a lovely French Bordeaux.  The bread served was good but not unusual.   The salads that we shared were thoughtfully prepared and very tasty.   The main meals were special as well.  Two of really enjoyed the recommended Haddock with parsnips and salad.  One of us took home some excellent Pork Shank.   My husband really liked the Wild Boar Ragu.  Only one diner was less complimentary about her meal of pan fried trout.  The prices were consistent with upscale dining.  My major disappointment was that the noise level increased significantly by the time we were preparing to leave at 7PM.
