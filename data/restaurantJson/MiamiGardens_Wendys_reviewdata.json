Upon eating the salad an insect was found.  I attached a photo of the salad with the insect inside.\nI immediately contacted the restaurant and was told by the Manager on duty that a refund would be given.  I had someone go a few days later on their off day to collect my refund and was told by the same Manager that I came too late, so I could not get a refund.  The police was called, because an incident report needed to be filed.\nI went onlne and left a complaint.  The District Manager contacted me back.  At that time I provided her all the details with what transpired on June 2 when the salad was purchased & what occured on June 6th.  I told the DM that I wanted my money back.  She ADVISED me that a refund would be mailed to me.  Today, June 13, I received a Wendys card In the mail.  \nI'm baffled, because my salad was not purchased using a Wendy's card and the DM knew that I wanted my money!!!\nI tried contacting the DM back via text & calling her yesterday and today, of course she didn't answer or call me back.\nWendys do business in an Unethical manner, which I don't appreciate.\nBottom line, I want my money and NOT in a form of a Wendys card!!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-14T05:26:09-0400", "location_id": "4651478", "id": "280103043", "user": {"username": "mistytea", "user_location": {"name": "FL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Kudos to Wendys for Waffle Cone Giveaway", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34440-d4651478-r207544284-m11068-Wendy_s-Miami_Gardens_Florida.html#review207544284", "text": "Wendy's gave away FREE Waffle Cones Memorial Day from 12 - 8 pm, so I stopped by to check it out.
