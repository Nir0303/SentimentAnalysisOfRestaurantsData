The decor is nice, there is a bar also.  We thought we'd like to dine in the bar as we thought we could watch sports.

I don't recommend the bar if you really want to watch an event as the bar is large enough it is also very noisy and hot.  We went on a Friday after work.  The happy hour prices higher here than their other locations.  We decided to eat in the restaurant as the bar was entirely too hot.\nThe wait staff is very attentive, the food arrives in a short period of time and looks and taste great!
