We had a cocktail and decided we wanted to eat upstairs so they moved us to a table and we had a wonderful l dinner.  The servers were all extremely attentive, we basically had two of them, who both went above and beyond explaining food and cocktail recipes to us.  My husband is gluten and dairy free and they were very helpful about his needs.  They also knew we were just visiting and recently married and brought us some champagne at the end of the meal.

They all were excellent...especially the dates.  For dinners, we tried the grilled skirt steak, the fish/grits, and the chicken. Having tried all my friends' dinners, I personally think the skirt steak was the best. The steak was tender and the veggies that came with it were awesome.  The fish/grits was a bit spicy for my taste and I didn't expect cheese grits to have such a \"kick.\"  We tried three desserts, too...the coconut cake, the bread pudding, and the pecan pie (with the maple bacon ice cream). Of all those, the pecan pie was the best.  But, that's just me...I'm not much of a fan of bread pudding or coconut cake. They both were good, though...just not my thing.\n\nWe ordered cocktails, too.  This was probably the worst part of our experience.  While they were good, too, they were quite small and rather expensive (at least for me) with a cocktail being $12 and wine being $11. But, on the other hand, they were jam-packed with liquor!  \n\nHowever, the thing that made Magnolia's on King the best was the greeting we received at the door and the very attentive (not overbearing) waitress we had.

All in all, I definitely recommend the spot! The food is solidly good. But there are some hits and misses which explains the rating. First things first: With our reservation, we were seated on the second floor near the bar area. That area maybe okay for brunch or earlier in the day, but definitely stay away from it in the evening on the weekends. In short, it became a nightmare because of the noise(we could barely hear each other speaking). They have an odd configuration outside of the bar area where it's a strange lounge with people sitting and yelling and talking in an open seating area next to the dining area. On top of that, they were moving the dining tables around while you're trying to eat. Odd! The first floor seem to be more ambient and it also had white tablecloths; at the same time, we noticed that the first floor was much warmer when we came in. MUCH warmer! As for the food itself, some of it was absolutely divine and other dishes were misses. The crab dip and the Caesar salad are worth the price of admission alone! They have perfected both of these appetizers. The smoked chicken is nicely seasoned and delicious as well, though it would be great to have better green vegetables on the side. The fish and grits is definitely going to be a surprise for people looking for a certain style of urban, southern comfort food. Spoiler: this ain't it! The grits are a very coarse, chunky hominy that tasted very much like a rich, creamed corn. The cheese flavor was absent all together. While the Rockfish had a nice flavor and seasoning, this dish did not resemble any traditional Southern fish and grits that I've ever seen or tasted. I definitely would not recommend it unless you really want to try a very haute take on the dish. The pecan pie dessert was okay/average. As for service, it started out really amazing but as the evening went on, our waiter kind of disappeared for a while. All of their staff were very nice and accommodating though, so I will definitely return.

Boy am I glad to have booked a reservation. The restaurant is right in the middle of vibrant Old Town Alexandria. If you sneeze you may miss it because it's a slender restaurant in the midst of centuries old buildings.\n\nThe food is Southern fusion and isn't at all fussy or overdone. There are mini corn bread muffins served at the start with a butter infused with something delightful I couldn't make out. We had the spicy crab dip and had to avoid licking our fingers in public. He ordered the shrimp and grits and it was the best I've ever tasted. But be forewarned it is spicy so if your stomach isn't fit for spice then choose something else. I chose the skirt steak and was happy for my selection; it was done perfectly. The bread pudding is firm, so if you're not typically a fan of bread pudding put your trust in theirs. And if you choose the pecan pie ask them to heat it because otherwise it will be served room temperature according to their standard.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint, bright, modern and tasteful. It is also quite intimate; there must be about 12-15 tables in total. The service is  spot on and I liked the attention to detail at Magnolia On King.\n\nIf you are in the Washington, DC area and need some inspired choices for dinner, I highly recommend this restaurant!

We sat upstairs where it was more lively and loud, but we were given the choice to sit in the quieter downstairs dining area. What fun would that be?!  The staff was friendly and pretty attentive. Drink selection was good, but our choices tasted just okay. The menu is limited, but we found several items that looked good to order. The crab dip was good, but not enough crab and too much cheese. Several people offered us additional bread for the dip, but it never materialized. The stuffed dates were delicious and so was the rockfish and grits. My husbands skirt steak was okay and undercooked. We didn't stay for dessert and decided to explore elsewhere.

If you have ever had New Orleans  Caf\u00e9 du Monde beignets, these were a far cry, but still a valiant effort, but the coffee ice cream served alongside it and on the same plate was way too strong. I notice they are no longer on the menu, so perhaps others voiced the same opinion.
