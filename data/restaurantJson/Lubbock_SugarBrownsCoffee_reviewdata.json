Sweet but not Starbucks feel-sick sweet.\n\nThe service is always friendly and you can grab a quick cup to go or enjoy the great environment at the shop. My kids even like going to hang out and color and pretend they are in college, ha!\n\nJust a really cool little corner of the world in Lubbock with great coffee.
