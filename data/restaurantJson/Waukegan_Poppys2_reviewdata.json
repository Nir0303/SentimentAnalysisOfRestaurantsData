I've being going since I was a kid and their ice cream cones are still one of the best.  Their size of cones are about half foot of ice cream which always I feel like a little kit with a huge ice cream.  Even tho it's a fast food restaurant is not that fast but that's because their food is always hot and fresh,  they always prepare your food fresh nothing precooked.  Which drive thru might take about 5 to 10 min depending on what you order so always make time or call in advance to place your order.  The owners are most of the time helping out customers and always very friendly people,  they always like to know their customers so by the next two or three visits they know what you like.
