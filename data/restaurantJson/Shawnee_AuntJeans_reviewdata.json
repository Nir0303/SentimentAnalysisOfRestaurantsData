It's a really small location, easy to find right on Johnson Drive just a couple of doors down from City Hall.\n\nThe ups:  There is a big variety of hand-made ice cream, gelatos and sorbets.  Unusual flavors are all hand-made in small batches.\n\nThe BIG down:  Price.  I guess you are paying for those small hand-made batches, but $4.50+ for two scoops in a plastic cup is ridiculous.  You can also purchase a quart for $11.50+ which is 100% absurd.\n\nSo I guess for a special date night with your sweetie or to try some unusual flavors that really did sound kinda good, then this is your place.
