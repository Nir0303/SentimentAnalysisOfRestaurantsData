The experience is well organized.  The clues and puzzles were difficult but not overly so.  Lots of different things to decipher to try to escape before time ran out.  The staff was great.  They explained things well, and have a good sense of timing in knowing when to ask if you need a hint. We definitely want to go back and try the different rooms!  I recommend it for a team building experience; a different kind of party experience; or just get a group together to have some fun!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-28T20:26:44-0400", "location_id": "8602505", "id": "412079830", "user": {"username": "inlight7", "user_location": {"name": "Concord, California", "id": "32243"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Team Building Event", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32724-d8602505-r338920836-m11068-Escape_Modesto-Modesto_California.html#review338920836", "text": "We took our entire work team and everyone had a fabulous time!

There were 10 of us and we did king Tuts Treasure.  Having never done an escape room before we were very excited! The personnel that run the escape room are very professional and extremely helpful. They explained all the rules gave us some tips and then \"locked\" us in the room. \n\n You definitely have to work together and communicate as there are clues all over the room. It's such a unique and fun experience\u2026 You have to at least try it once. But I think we will be trying it twice\u2026 Because we enjoyed it so much we would like to come back and try another room.\n\nIt's such a unique and fun experience\u2026 You have to at least try it once.
