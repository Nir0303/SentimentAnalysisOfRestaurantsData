I walked in the roim and immediantly was slapped in the face by this old stinch of cig. Smoke. So i went to the front desk was given a hard time about getting a second room so i asked for my money back mind u i had only had my key no longer than 3 minutes or so and was told i could not get a refund because i had already walked in the hotel. I was one of maybe three guest and one of which was at the front desk as well complaining of the skimpy towels with holes in them and a big dark brown smudge on one of them \"saw this for myself the guest was highly upset with this\" anyways i made due with my room as i hadno choice so i go to take a shower to find a corner of a condom rapper behind the toilet and a ball of hair. Could not get the heat to work so went again to thos front desk and the guy was rude about cutting the switch on. And three different times in one night it kept getting very cold so i again went to the front desk to have him tell me the breaker keeps cutting it off \"i did not believe him\" i think he was finding it hallarious to be honest. So next morning i ask to skeak with a manager and was greated by the owner and let me tell you something about this women...she is the most disrespectful non educated buisness individual i have ever met in my life. She told me she did not give a damn how i felt after we had some words about how disrespectful her staff was and about the rooms. I now understand why there was only two or three people there. And to top it off as i was leaving the housekeeper as i walked back in my room apparently saw me go to the front desk was in my room when i returned cleaning the room at 925 in the morning and the next day my credit cards and debit card all four had several purchases made from jet.com. i did however find out a month later after the investigation was over that it was her and did press charges the trial begins in two weeks from today.

It is clean and well kept.  The bed was good, although the pillows were lumpy.  There is free wi-fi, fridge, and a coffee maker.  Wayne, the night manager is very friendly and helpful.   CONS: it is a block from the fire station which we only heard once in the evening.  It's also 2 story and I don't think they have an elevator.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "K P, Manager at Townhouse Inn High Point, responded to this review", "text": "We appreciate your review.

The only problems were that we reserved a smoking room, so when we entered the room, it was really stale and stinky.  We sprayed the carpet with carpet fresh and sprayed the room with lysol.  There also had been no ice bucket liner or cups left, and the packet of coffee had been opened with no cups or creamer packets left.  But, the continental breakfast in the lobby was WONDERFUL!!  Fresh waffles with all the fixings, juice, great coffee with flavored creamers, cereals, pastries, etc...couldn't have ask for better!  All in all, we had a very pleasant stay!\nThank you!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "K P, Manager at Townhouse Inn High Point, responded to this review", "text": "Although it has been sometime since you posted a review, we would loke to thank you for your review and have addressed the issues you noted.
