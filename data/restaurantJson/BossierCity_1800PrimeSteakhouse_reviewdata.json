Let say it is hard to complain about a free meal as that is what we had from a offer the wife received\n Yet, I feel that something should be said\n It says Steakhouse yet, they have more seafood plates than steak\n We are seated a litle early which was fine andvery quickly  a glass of water was delivered\n Our waitress came by and  left as we wanted a little more time\n I wonder if you getthe same service when a offer is used as you do if you are paying.\n We order a salad to start I just wanted a plain lettuce and tomato. (Thinking iceberg lettuce ) The wife gets a different type. The salad arrives and mine has grapes, some sort of dark stemmed lettuce and a wide leaf type green . There were several large pieces of the base of a lettuce head and large stems .Disappointed \n I order a T bone with only salt and pepper .No garlic butter ,no seasoning nothing \n You would think that would gve the hint of just  meat and salt and pepper .Also a baked potato The steak 44.00 the potato is 7.00\n The wife gets a rib eye the same way\n  The meal arrives and here is some kindof brown gravy poured on the steaks\n  Use to be any time you put something in a steak or ask fro any sort of sauce it was a sign of disrespect to the cook . Guess now it is the norm.\n We expected  apretty bug potato for the pirce and was surprised to see how small it was and the peeling was really hard\n  We waited for ever to get dressing for the salad and the 2 nd glass of tea was out of the question. \n The waitress was really attentive at the start and then quickly tapered off\n  We had finished our meal before she ever retunred to see if we needed anything\n  I will say she may have been very new at this type of job\n  The steak price needs to drop about about 10.00 or more and the poatato needs to drop in price by at least 4.00\n  I can't say the food was bad at all it was good just over priced and not to my tatse with the  gravy \n I would eat here again but not at the prices they charge and now know I have to tell them no gravy", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Anthony C, General Manager at 1800 Prime Steakhouse, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

After reading mostly good reviews we decided to go to 1800 Prime. This was the worst mistake I made for our anniversary. The drink server had no knowledge of the bar drinks or types of alcohol available, we had to go to the bar ourself to find out about available rums. That was a little inconvenient but not a deal breaker. We sat in a booth, expecting a romantic atmosphere, but the kitchen is close to the seating area, so the LARGE doors were constantly flinging open and close. The booths were really large family seating booths with no personality, just a cheap white cloth. The waitress was not very personal and the food was not up to par for almost $150.00. The food was consistent with the buffet and we probably would have saved a lot of money just going to the buffet. This is NOT up to high end steak house standards.

Chef Monday touch tables, something you only see on TV Bar Rescue and he will even whip up something nice for you on special request. The food is up there with The Capital Grill. The atmosphere is awesome and my favorite sever Lee is on point; people stop by to say hi even if they are not eating there that night. I will stick to 1800 Prime Steak House, any other Steak House is just uncivilized...", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "ExcellenceMgr, Guest Relations Manager at 1800 Prime Steakhouse, responded to this review", "text": "We are so glad you had a great experience while dining with us.

The baked potato is a decent size\n The Chef comes out and checks on you to see if the food is ok ,which I think is a nice gesture.

T-bone is out of line and 4.00 for a salad or a baked potato or 4 asparagus sprouts is way out of line\n Every thing has a separate price \n The wife and I ate here it cost us 98.00 plus tip and tax\n For two T-bones ,two baked potatoes, and one asparagus side dish. We both had water\n Something else that is surprising is you have to make reservations. The first time we tried they told  us it would be 4 days from the day we tried.\n We thought Wow!!! these must be good steaks.\n We made another attempt latter and got in quicker, yet the time we were in there we never saw more than 6 or 8 people being waited on. \n I think they do this to make you think it is better than what it is\n  Just way over priced in my book", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "ExcellenceMgr, Guest Relations Manager at 1800 Prime Steakhouse, responded to this review", "text": "We are happy you are enjoyed your food at 1800 Prime.
