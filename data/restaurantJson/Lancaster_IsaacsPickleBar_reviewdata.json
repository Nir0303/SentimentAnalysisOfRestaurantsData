As my husband and I were travelling through the area, and my memories of Isaacs were so good, I urged my husband to stop here for a late lunch/early dinner. Well, I do know now that it is not the same place, and I will not come back. I won't say it was terrible, but the whole experience was somewhere between average and poor. My first concern was the service. In my opinion, not knowing the draft list and under-informing us of what was available was one issue, but not a huge deal. However, having to remind the waitress to bring a drink and the mustard, or never receiving the requested knife were unforgivable. The real issue was the portion size consistency. I do recall the overstuffed sandwiched of years ago to be a bit over the top, so seeing that they were not the same was almost welcomed. My sandwich was normal, however, my husband's half sandwich was a different story. He ordered a soup/sandwich combo. The sandwich, which was a grilled turkey sandwich with melted cheese, bacon, and tomato had all the necessary elements...except for the turkey. He opened the sandwich to apply the mustard (yes, the same mustard that we had to request twice...and never received a knife to actually spread the mustard), and was quite surprised to find a sliver of lunchmeat-style turkey that would not be enough to feed a 2-yr old. Seriously, there was about a quarter to a half of a very thin slice of meat on his half sandwich. If I could give you a mental picture (and I wish I would have taken one) it was like 4-5 pieces of meat cut the size and thickness of a quarter. We are very conscientious eaters, as we are both very fit and slim, so it's not like we were wanting a Big Mac or anything of the sort...but this was ridiculous.  So ridiculous, in fact, that I called the waitress over to question as to whether this was a mistake. She looked at the sandwich and agreed that it must be some sort of mistake, apologized and took the sandwich back to the kitchen. Unfortunately, what was returned to us was not much better. This sandwich was the same sandwich that was removed from our table with 2 additional quarter-sized peices of meat on it. It was rather pathetic. The waitress apologized, and made some excuse that when a half-sandwich is ordered, the portion sizes are often uneven...but somehow the point was completely missed, and the problem was not fixed. I won't go back, and my memory is scarred.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Johnny R, Marketing Coordinator at Isaac&#39;s Pickle Bar, responded to this review", "text": "Hi, Kirstan!\n\nFirst let me apologize for the bad experience you had on your visit to our Downtown Lancaster.
