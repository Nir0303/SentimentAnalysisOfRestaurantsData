Definitely give it a try!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46890-d6726075-r262116888-m11068-Kura_Thai_and_Sushi-Vineland_New_Jersey.html#review262116888", "text": "My husband noticed this restaurant in his travels, and since we always try to support local endeavors, we decided to try it.  From the outside, it looks inviting.  As soon as you walk in, there is the sushi bar with its fresh seafood featured prominently. For atmosphere, the restaurant could use more ethnic decor.  There was an interesting Buddha painting, but it was kind of out of the way, on a back wall.  You almost had to look for it.  The thing that struck me upon entering, was a peculiar odor, like cleaning or polishing agent.  It was strong enough, and offensive enough to me, that I thought of walking out, but we were here for the food, so we stayed.  Another thing that I didn't like, were the two large televisions.  Both were hung in such a way that you were always fighting being drawn into looking at it.  This is obviously a family-run place.  A cute little oriental girl was sitting alone in a booth, eating a whole cucumber.  She was glued to the cartoons on one of the tv's.  I wished I had my camera.  Another, similar-looking, but a bit older girl, sat at a table in a different part of the restaurant, her nose and fingers in an I-Pad.  My last atmospheric comment is regarding the music.  To me, it was a real turn-off,  young people's music -- neither dinner music nor ethnic Thai music.  This restaurant is a BYOB although it doesn't advertise that fact.  They have a tie-in with a local vineyard.  Everyone we had any contact with there, was extremely friendly, and talkative, although I had some trouble understanding their English.  From the appetizer menu, we ordered shumai -- steamed dumplings with seafood ($4.75) and Kushi yaki ($6.50) -- two skewers with a shrimp on each, half of a scallop, and a small piece of salmon.  Both appetizers were tasty, although for me, the skewer was drowning in a teriyaki sauce, which for me was much too sweet.  I'd have rather had the sauce on the side.  The Tom Yum Gung soup truly hit the spot, with just the right amount of vegetables and shrimp floating in a broth, and nicely spiced.  For entres, I ordered the Bangkok spicy shrimp, which had 3 red peppers next to it on the menu, and the green curry shrimp.  Both dishes came with jasmine rice.  Mine came in an edible bowl, reminiscent of Chinese fried noodles, served on top of chopped lettuce.  Inside were shrimps, onions, sweet peppers, scallions and basil in a thick sweet sauce, (was this again teriyaki?) which proved disappointing because it was hardly spicy at all.  My husband's entre was more to my liking.  It was served in a little pot over a candle to keep it warm.  Again shrimp, all the vegetables I had, but also zucchini, bamboo shoots, eggplant, string beans in a green coconut-milk  sauce.  Both dishes had nice-sized shrimps, which they did not skimp on, and the shrimps were perfectly cooked.  At the end, when they asked us how we liked our meal, we said we did, which is true, but I commented that my spicy shrimp was not spicy at all, a couple of servers gathered around our table to discuss who likes spicy and how spicy.  I said that since it showed 3 red peppers, the only dish on the menu depicted that way, I thought it would be spicy, but one young lady told us how the soup we had is too spicy for her and she has it watered down before eating it.  There should have been a discussion about that, with us at the time we ordered, not now after the fact.  Anyway, for under $40, which is what the dinner cost us, what's there to complain about?  Besides, this being Vineland, we were pleased to find such a restaurant.  So, if yo're in the mood for Thai or sushi, this place gets our vote.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-27T10:45:28-0400", "location_id": "6726075", "id": "262116888", "user": {"username": "Nitvoyodelo", "user_location": {"name": "Vineland, New Jersey", "id": "46890"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46890-d6726075-r261076058-m11068-Kura_Thai_and_Sushi-Vineland_New_Jersey.html#review261076058", "text": "My wife and i decided to try this place after church it was nicely priced and very good food the sushi was great service was good price average", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-22T09:29:39-0400", "location_id": "6726075", "id": "261076058", "user": {"username": "Peter H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Delicious", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46890-d6726075-r246596437-m11068-Kura_Thai_and_Sushi-Vineland_New_Jersey.html#review246596437", "text": "I've been coming hear for months now and have never had a bad meal or bad sushi.
