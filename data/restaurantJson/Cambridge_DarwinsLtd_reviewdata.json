(Note: some of these are \"specials\" meaning that they only appear on the menu once a week.)\n\nNow, is Darwin's perfect? No. It is small very small, which is particularly frustrating when it is busy. There is nowhere to sit inside, and the employees sometimes rub me the wrong way.\n\nBut, here is my advice to you, if you work close-ish to Darwin's then stop by for a sandwich. If you want something to-go that will taste amazing then stop by for a sandwich.
