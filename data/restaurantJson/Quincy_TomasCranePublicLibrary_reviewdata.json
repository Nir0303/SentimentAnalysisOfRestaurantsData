As I sat & listen to the music, my eyes wandered to the polished woods of the floors, the balcony above, the sunlight pouring through the floor to ceiling windows and wondered to myself, \"what took you so long to return here\"?  \nThe architecture of the building is nothing short of magnificent. The original building was designed by H.H. Richardson in 1882 with 3 additional stages added over the years ending with the last addition in 2001 by a brilliant team of Boston based architects.   \nWhen the concert finished, I took a few minutes to wander around some of the familiar grounds I remembered from QHS days. I located the huge stained glass window that was designed by John Lafarge ~~ a memory from a French IV class tour back in the day.\nThe pristinely landscaped grounds were designed by Frederick Law Olmstead of the Emerald Necklace & Central Park fame.\nAll-in-all, I still have to reflect and ask myself why? Why when I live only minutes away do I not take advantage of this absolutely extraordinary and lovely spot right in my neighborhood?  \nThe TC rocks and I have made it a point to return there several more times since the concert 2 months ago.
