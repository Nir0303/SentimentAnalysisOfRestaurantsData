Without the benefit of GPS with just happened upon La Unica. What a great little gem tucked away in this quiet little town. Our server was very friendly and made some helpful suggestions regarding cocktails (Blueberry Margarita-YUM!) and menu options. We hope our family and friends in the area will frequent this great place in the future.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-01-14T05:04:22-0500", "location_id": "1818477", "id": "339942135", "user": {"username": "Stitchin'goddess", "user_location": {"name": "Mpls./St.Paul", "id": null}}}]}
