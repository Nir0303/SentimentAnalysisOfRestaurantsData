So that kinda killed our plans to have several different for all to try a bunch of styles.\n\nHad a meat lovers and a Hawaiian.  Amazing.  Some salads were split.  And some cheese garlic bread.  Yum.  Great meal, and service was stepped up from my last visit.\n\nGood selection of craft beers, of which a few were had at our table.
