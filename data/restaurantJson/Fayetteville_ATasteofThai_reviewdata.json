The locale is not flashy or upscale but it was nice and clean despite the time of night (we got in there late, around 9:30PM). \n\nThe service was great and our waiter, Travis, was wonderful. Not only was he friendly and easy to talk to, he was also fast and efficient. On top of that he also recommended a dish for my wife that she absolutely loved. \n\nThe food was really really good. In fact, it was some of the best Asian food I've had in a long time. I had sweet & sour chicken, which was different to what I was used to, but very good none the less. My wife had a dish I can't remember the name of, but it had chicken and soft rice noodles and a delicious sauce. Both were excellent meals and there was so much food that we had to bring almost half of it with us home, despite being quite hungry.\n\nRecommended!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-19T08:43:59-0400", "location_id": "783835", "id": "394340483", "user": {"username": "PerStumo", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
