We gave a chance to Black Angus on April 2016, not only they made us wait for 30 minutes (Restaurant was not busy at all) to cook Salmon, but inside middle of Salmon was clearly uncooked. We called manager to complain. BBQ Baby Back Ribs: it was just OK in my opinion. Some flavor was missing. I ordered Full Rack size, it was fairly large size, but had not enough meat on it. Fire-Grilled Chicken Breasts was OK, I guess. Bleu Filet Mignon was good, according to my son. They discontinued Garlic Mashed Potatoes. It was our favorite. Fire-Grilled Fresh Artichoke was good, but got smaller and smaller. Overall, quality of food has been down graded in the past a few years. What we like Black Angus is nice private style table that you don't sit with other guests top of each other. Service is good. We would recommend this restaurant highly if you would ask us many years ago, but for now, we are not sure anymore. Because, truthfully speaking, someday food is good, but someday food is bad...really bad. Maybe, the day you go to there for Lunch or Dinner, food may be good.
