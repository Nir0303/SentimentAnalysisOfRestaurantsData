Some people of your party started carrying the tables from the patio area from one side to the other. We do not allow customers to carry tables on top of their heads and move them around. After moving the outside tables around, your party decided to seat inside the restaurant since there was a large table that got cleared. Even though that there were other guests that were waiting for that table, your party decided to take that table.After going inside, your party left all the outside tables and chairs wherever they wanted. They were other guests that had to wait for somebody to go outside and place all the furniture back in place. I told my personnel to not let customers to do whatever they wanted.
