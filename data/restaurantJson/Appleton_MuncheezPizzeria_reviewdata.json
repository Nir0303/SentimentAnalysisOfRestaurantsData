I've been having delivery lately so I can only rate staff by the delivery person and time it took to get here. All in all I'd have to rate it a 5. Thre ads say lots of Cheese, but I'd disagree. A lot of cheese is when you have a huge problem eating it for the first 2 pieces or so.  This pie had mediocre amount and didn't \"pull\" even with the first piece.\n Delivery came within 30 minutes.   The delivery person was friendly and put a smile on. He said to hang on to the order ticket because after 7 pies you get a free one. Also a free drink with an online coupon. That I did mention I already had but guess the person taking the order didn't hear that. You get a free small order of cheese sticks with a 14\" or 16\". Those were good..... \n Will I save 7 tickets to get a free one?   At 21$ for a pepperoni, mushroom, onion, and black olive, so so pizza? Doubtful. But I won't say terrible.
