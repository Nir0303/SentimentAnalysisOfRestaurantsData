Great service and delicious, seasonal food made from fresh ingredients. We went early because we were told they often sell out of food. However, it wasn't very crowded, probably because it was a rainy day. Highly recommended.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-12T14:23:05-0400", "location_id": "2476076", "id": "288314247", "user": {"username": "Madtown-Morris", "user_location": {"name": "Madison, Wisconsin", "id": "60859"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "A gem in downtown rogers.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31892-d2476076-r287553529-m11068-Heirloom-Rogers_Arkansas.html#review287553529", "text": "I recently had lunch here and was so impressed with the quality of the food and the service, I cannot wait to go back.

Very simple menu -- one soup, one salad, one sandwich offered on a chalkboard menu.  Everything is fresh and freshly cooked/prepared.  Service was great! I think our server was also an owner.  The cook/chef came out to talk with us and make sure we were enjoying our lunch.  And we were enjoying and savoring every bite!  As mentioned by other reviewers, the small, unpretentious restaurant has an \"urban vibe\" that is quite unexpected but also quite pleasant.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-18T09:40:24-0400", "location_id": "2476076", "id": "281166044", "user": {"username": "Jane52_13", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}]}
