Seating is indoor and covered patio. There's also a second outdoor patio that's dog friendly.\n\nThe food is prepared well, and all ingredients are fresh, natural and sourced from nearby growers and suppliers. The menu is updated seasonally and each week features a couple new specials.\n\nThere are plenty of menu options for herbivores and omnivores. They are also happy to whip up your own creations.\n\nOne of my favorites from the menu are the pumpkin mini pancakes which have a whipped cinnamon butter drizzled over them. I prefer them just the way they come, but of course fresh jams and syrup are available too.\n\nI enjoy getting a bowl of fruit with an english muffin along with sides of sliced tomatoes, avocado and a scrambled egg. Makes a great open-faced breakfast sandwich and the fruit is always super fresh.\n\nThere are a variety of coffee and juice selections, including hot brew, flavored, and cold brew coffees as well as regular and strawberry orange juices.\n\nDefinitely a popular place on Sundays, but even when it's packed out you'll have great service and feel like you've had brunch with a really big family.
