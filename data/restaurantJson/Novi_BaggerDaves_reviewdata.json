The whole family met there- 11 of us. We had a reservation... but they were not quite ready...  for 30 more minutes. It was a beautiful night, 45 degrees and windy. No rain yet. They had signs up for the \"wet floor\" but there was no water. Having worked through college in food service, I recognized the really slick floor that got mopped with the \"behind the line grease mop.\" A poor practice that I only mention because 2 different people in our party nearly fell walking on the \"dry\" floor on the way to the restroom. \n\nDividing our group , 4 people and 7 people, proved to be a monumental task. The waitress explained how challenging it was several times and then brought along another waitress to explain that it was hard. We never quite understood. She just had that \" I am already WAY too stressed out\" attitude. We felt we'd send her over the edge if we asked anything else. \n\nWe ordered 2 orders of sloppy fries, just like the name says. They arrived in a timely fashion but had to ask twice for silverware and napkins. We were handed a single napkin with 11 forks and 11 knives,,,, Sloppy fries? A challenge with no napkins. But they did bring plates. \n\nShe took our orders, with difficulty. All but one asked for their burgers \"no pink.\" It's a burger place. There are only 2 options on the menu for cooking: pink/no pink. 6 of 7 of us ordered \"no pink.\" To make her life easier, I even turned in a written slip (an option there) indicating with a check mark \"no pink.\" They ALL came pink. I was so hungry at this point, I looked for just one bite to take that was not undercooked. NO luck. I had to send it back. The rest suffered. It was a birthday after all and we were trying to stay upbeat. \n\nWhile waiting for my re cook, after our waitress emptied her tray of deliveries, I held up some glases, since we all had 2 by then (trying to keep the 3 and 5 year old from breaking anything) and asked, \"may I give you these?\" She said no, she'd be back later...Everyone had completely finished, waiting on the birthday song and cake when my burger came. It wasn't even yummy. I had to add salt and pepper to get it to taste like anything. She apologized but left it on the bill. \n\nThe dishes continued to stack up at the table. Zero table maintenance. I finally placed half of them on the dessert counter behind me. There they sat for an hour. The whole experience was poor- food, service, wait. I will never return. We enjoyed our family time however and focused on that.
