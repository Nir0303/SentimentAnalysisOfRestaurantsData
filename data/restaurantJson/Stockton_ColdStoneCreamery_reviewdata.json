Lots of add on toppings too. I usually stop here after seeing a movie. On this visit, there was no one in the facility so I was immediately helped. I've read other reviews that mention the workers not being attentive...that wasn't the case of me and hope it never is. I wasn't sure about a couple of the flavors and the worker offered me taste samples. I ended up going with the dark chocolate ice cream with Reese's added. Pretty good! Now the price is a completely different story here (applies to all CSCs). I think the price is a bit high for the amount of ice cream you get. I would rate them 4 stars if the prices were about 10-15% less. I guess we're paying for convenience. As long as the price doesn't continue to slowly increase, I'll be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-29T21:05:08-0400", "location_id": "4947184", "id": "359929911", "user": {"username": "Kitman", "user_location": {"name": "Oxnard, California", "id": "32837"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Birthday treat", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d4947184-r356802247-m11068-Cold_Stone_Creamery-Stockton_California.html#review356802247", "text": "For a treat on a birthday we went to cold stone creamery, I must say even though the neighborhood is less that desirable  we went anyhow.

The wait person was friendly and helpful in answering all our questions and comments.  She was the only person working there at the time.  We were the only people in the store but more came in after us.  My husband and I ordered the strawberry funnel cake with vanilla ice cream , my son had a brownie sundae and my grandson had 2 big scoops of different flavored ice cream.  The only complaint my husband and I had about the food was the strawberries were frozen whole and were quite tart in comparison to the sweetness of the ice cream. We are in the middle of Strawberry Season and they are grown locally so not sure why our area berries which are red, sweet, fresh and cheap, could not have been used.  The frozen ones were also quite hard so they were left on the plate. The only other thing I can call out was the floors were very dirty.  There were broken cones on the floor that had been stepped on and broken cones under our table and the table was not wiped down so we had to wipe them ourselves.  I need you to keep in mind that the wait person was in there alone and it was after a show let out so she was probably busy.  She was great to deal with and what is better than an ice cream after a movie?", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-01T09:31:03-0400", "location_id": "4947184", "id": "305909047", "user": {"username": "Stephanie M", "user_location": {"name": "Valley Springs, California", "id": "33215"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Yummy tummy time!! \ud83d\ude0b", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33130-d4947184-r224076597-m11068-Cold_Stone_Creamery-Stockton_California.html#review224076597", "text": "It was my husbands first time here we went for my birthday.
