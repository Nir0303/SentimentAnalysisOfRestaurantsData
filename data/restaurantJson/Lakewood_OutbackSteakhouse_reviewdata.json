When we walked in, the places was filled with people from end to end...there was NO room. Most places would buckle under the pressure and appear rude to guests. However, the front desk staff here was pleasant in informing us of our 45 minute wait. They offered to find a seat for us at the bar. We accepted. Once we sat at the bar, the busier than heck bartender found a moment to greet us, take our drink order (which she got right) and then proceeded to offer us free bread/butter. She continued to check in with us in spite of being super busy and have more needy customers! Once we were seated, our server was polite, informative, kind, and personable. All the orders were brought on time and were made to perfection. It's nice to see that some places keep up their good reputation, especially in these days where customer service often lacks.\nBoth the food and the service get 5 stars!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-04-08T07:45:35-0400", "location_id": "341618", "id": "157028349", "user": {"username": "Brian S", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}]}
