Recommend to build your own bowl so you know exactly what you are getting. There are choices of three scopes of fish or five. I went with five scopes to check put more kinds. Recommend the salmon, spicy tune, albacore, and yellowtail. For sauce, I tried Oke, heat, Okeyaki, and sesame. All good and recommended! Do note that with rice, the five-scope bowl tends to be huge! I cou don't finish my rice and barely finished my fish and vegetables. Go with three scopes if you are not too hungry :) ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-03T12:28:28-0400", "location_id": "10039278", "id": "400975283", "user": {"username": "Rachelle W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Good and satisfying", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32206-d10039278-r357333527-m11068-Oke_Poke-Chino_Hills_California.html#review357333527", "text": "Many poke places are popping out of nowhere and have yet to be listed on TA unlike the Y site. But Oke Poke seems to got in on the foray that started mostly in the OC last year. Had their 5 scoop and was good for the afternoon. While I'm not a critique on food, it did me fine and didn't have any repercussions. The place was the most packed even more than the Mexican food joint next door. Yes, the food is trendy right now and prices are high, but I would eat again if you care about your health and taste buds.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-21T08:40:05-0400", "location_id": "10039278", "id": "357333527", "user": {"username": "d l", "user_location": {"name": "So Cal", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Their Poke Bowls Are Delicious", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32206-d10039278-r353617934-m11068-Oke_Poke-Chino_Hills_California.html#review353617934", "text": "Their poke bowls are delicious.  Poke is a Hawaiian dish comprised of raw fish with various mix-ins that you select.  You get to choose your fish, base, toppings, and sauce or you can order one of their standard bowls. Even if you select a standard, you can customize the toppings.  I chose the Crunchy Garlic with half-and-half Ahi tuna and salmon, brown rice, seaweed, ginger, crab, avocado, and sesame oil.  My husband who likes spicier food ordered the firecracker bowl. Both were delicious.  (I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.)  The restaurant is in suburban strip mall.  It has both indoor and outdoor tables.  They also do a lot of take out business.
