First off, as we pulled up to the front, the bell guys were talking and just stood there.  We had to exit the car and walk up to them to engage.  Next off, our room was not ready, granted it was 1:30 and check-in was at three.  Next, we were not greeted or thanked for being diamond members, something that always happens.  Reception gave us executive lounge key and we waited and waited and waited.  Finally around 3:30, we went back down to the desk and room still not ready.  Finally at 4, we received our entry card.  The hotel is old but has been renovated and we had a larger corner room.  Safe did not work, no real drawer space. Executive lounge for breakfast was pretty iffy too.  When we arrived, the room was so smoky (burned toast?) that we got choked up.  Food on the hot servers was cold as it was turned off.  Coffee was good.  Long story short, we decided to not stay for the second night.
