The burger was good, but the wait was longer than expected.  The fries came out and everything was plopped in a bag, fries on top of the rest of the purchase.  We were eating in and found nothing to dump the fries out onto.  Don't mind getting all of the other condiments yourself, but felt it was a little too casual dining.  I wouldn't go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-04T08:57:08-0400", "location_id": "2290256", "id": "203990557", "user": {"username": "Mary Kay O", "user_location": {"name": "Pembroke Pines, FL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Order Taker/Cashier Was On Something", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34548-d2290256-r201607913-m11068-Five_Guys-Pembroke_Pines_Florida.html#review201607913", "text": "Was here April 17, 2014. Food was good, but that is not why I am writing this time. It had been about 6 weeks since we had been here. There were 3 people in our party. The \"guy\" taking the order was obviously HIGH on something. Could not understand what we were ordering (and yes we do speak English perfectly), had to explain various times and still could not understand what a \"glass of water was\". Second, our order came out to $32.17, I gave \"high guy\" $40.17. Simple right, he has to give me $8.oo back. Well he is standing there looking at the money I kid you not almost 5 minutes and could not figure it out. I had to say out loud, where is the Manager... Manager comes over I explain to him and he gives me correct change. Manager starts to walk away and I Have To Ask \"high guy\" for my receipt with my order number on it. Manager finally got it that this guy was a fruit cake and sent him elsewhere. When I look at the receipt, I notice that \"high guy\" had not put in our order correct. I decided it was not worth the bother and took the order as it was. I will come back in about a month and hope \"high guy\" is not there, if it is a screw up again I will not come back and go back to Elevation Burger from now on.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-04-17T17:22:54-0400", "location_id": "2290256", "id": "201607913", "user": {"username": "CaptainKuddles", "user_location": {"name": "Miami, Florida", "id": "34438"}}}]}
