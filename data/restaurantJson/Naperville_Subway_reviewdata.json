You almost have to beg these people to put on a little extra lettuce and everything else. Ask for olives and they drizzle 3 or 4 pieces. Ask for onion and you get a few strands. Why can't they build a sandwich that looks like the ones in their advertisements? Furthermore, when I gave my gift card to the cashier he said there was no more money on it. I told him that there certainly was and he insisted no. So I paid cash. I than went back to my office and went on the computer to check on it. There definitely was more than enough money on the card to pay for my lunch. Maybe this restaurant can't hide the cash if you give them a gift card? \"Mmmmm\" I would not be going back to this location again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-24T05:22:19-0400", "location_id": "4203991", "id": "358138885", "user": {"username": "John T", "user_location": {"name": "Burr Ridge, Illinois", "id": "35742"}}}]}
