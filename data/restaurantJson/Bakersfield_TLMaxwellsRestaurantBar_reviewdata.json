I really liked the entrance and bar area.  In fact, I think the bar and bartender is the best thing about this place!  Great drinks and very attentive service from the bartender.  \n\nOnce seated, we were waited on right away and our waitress was great.  However, once our food came, it was pretty 'eh.'  Especially for the price.  I had the Gorgonzola Balsamic Filet,  there was so much sauce on the plate that not only was the steak overpowered by the balsamic, but the baked potato tasted like balsamic AND the veggies tasted like balsamic.  EVERYTHING tasted the same.  It was pretty awful.  My husband had a rib eye (I think, could have been a NY) that was in a red wine reduction looking sauce and there was a ton of sauce on his plate as well.  For the price, my husband said his steak was just ok.  Our waitress could tell I didn't like my dish and I explained that the vegetables and baked potato really soaked up the balsamic and she replied something to the effect that they've had that complaint before.\n\nWe really wanted to try one of their desserts because we heard they're fantastic, but our waitress just brought our check, so we paid and left.  \n\nI'd like to give this place another shot, but at this price point I don't think we will.

Our server only visited the table to take our order and give us our bill, otherwise we had about five other people help us. No one ever offered a drink refill. The female server that was helping nearby tables was great with them and very attentive to her customers, our guy wasn't.  Seems like a bit of a hit and miss place. Although not horrible,  we wont be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-10-07T14:37:15-0400", "location_id": "469235", "id": "180111156", "user": {"username": "217Traci68", "user_location": {"name": "Bakersfield, California, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "Best Fine Dining in Bakersfield - By Far", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32037-d469235-r167108044-m11068-T_L_Maxwell_s_Restaurant_Bar-Bakersfield_California.html#review167108044", "text": "I've had meals all over the US, on the Left Bank in Paris, all over Europe, and on a few islands in the Pacific - and I have to say, T L Maxwell's food definitely holds its own against some of the world's finest dining.\n\nWe went there for my birthday and everyone was ecstatic over what they ordered.  Yes, it's a bit pricey ($100+ for 3 people), but once in awhile, when you want to treat yourself or others, it is definitely worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual, romantic - and dark.  But once you get in there and get seated, your eyes adjust and it wasn't bad at all.  Besides, everyone looks just a little better in low light.\n\nService was perfect (mid-week, there weren't many people there).  I highly recommend you plan for this culinary treat - and go!

The fillets were large and one of the best tasting that we have had.  The pork chops were the right mix of sweet and spicy and the orange roughy was cooked to perfection.  The evening was enhanced with a knowledgeable and efficient waitress which brought on a great evening. They also had a wonderful clam chowder.

It is located in an alley in downtown Bakersfield.  While getting out of our car we were approached by a homeless panhandler.  When returning to our car, we had to walk around 3 people who were diving in the restaurant 's dumpster.  Not exactly our idea of a special night out.  Anyhow, to the restaurant itself - it is very old, out of date and shabby.  It may appeal to some who are going down Memory Lane - not to us.  The food - my husband ordered the blue cheese stuffed steak which was grisly and smothered with a heavy sauce - he couldn't  eat it.  When I ordered my Shrimp Caesar salad - the waitress asked what kind of dressing did I want??  Caesar, please.  To be fair, my salad was fine.  The waitress was a tad over familiar for our liking but that seemed to go with the whole atmosphere and is probably how the owner likes the staff to be.  The bar was deserted - just one patron.  We all thought it was pretty expensive.  Won't return - didn't feel safe in the area at night and were pleasantly surprised to find the wheels still on our car when we returned to it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-12-10T03:56:58-0500", "location_id": "469235", "id": "147120666", "user": {"username": "DaisyDora", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}]}
