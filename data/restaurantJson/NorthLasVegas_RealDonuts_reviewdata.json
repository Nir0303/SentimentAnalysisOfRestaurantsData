We did a turn around and decided to have a mid afternoon snack of a donut and coffee.  Not a big place but there are a few tables.  These donuts were about the best we've ever had!  Good quality chocolate on donuts and the raspberry and Bavarian filled donuts were chuck full inside.  We recommend stopping here.

Charleston, since they have more than one location. (I haven't been to the E. Lake Mead store).  The donuts at the Charleston store are very good, fresh tasting, large in size, sweet and light. Just all around quality donuts.  Nothing weird or freaky gourmet, just solid good donuts that are better than the typical chain stuff.  Now, if you are an out of towner, the Charleston location might be a bit \"iffy\".  It's near downtown, lots of traffic on very very busy Charleston, and heading into some of the rougher areas of town towards the medical center.. I got panhandled in the parking lot, so that wasn't great. (again, this is not the Lake Mead location, so that area may be quite different).  But if you are a tourist or a local looking for a donut sugar high \"fix\" Real Donut is an excellent choice.  Only one little glitch at the Charleston store, a mistake was made and I got a cream filled instead of one cream and one raspberry filled, so watch carefully and be sure you get what you're supposed to get.  It was a somewhat busy little shop (that's because it's popular with locals around there who know it is good value).  They are very nice and friendly.  It's also closer to The Strip for tourists. But again, keep your eyes open.  Hey, it's Vegas!
