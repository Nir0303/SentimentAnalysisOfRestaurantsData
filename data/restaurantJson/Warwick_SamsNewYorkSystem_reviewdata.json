This place is listed under a couple pages on TripAdvisor so I'll leave this review on both. I walked in to this place about 7:30pm on a Thursday night. I looked live a real dive when I walked in but I've had good chow in some real dives so I didn't let that sway me. I ordered three dogs without onions, some fries and a side of cheese sauce. I should have known this was going to be a bad experience when the guy (dressed in a dirty polo) dropped my fries into the fryer then immediately turned to his coworker and asked if he had turned the fryer off. The guy responded that the fryer was on...there was no sound of frozen fries hitting hot oil so I figured that wasn't going to go well. Sure enough, I get back to my room and the fries were warm and cooked, but soggy as expected. One fry eaten and the rest thrown away (and the cup of hot cheese which I passed on even trying to use to make the fries anywhere close to edible). Now to the dogs (or wieners as they're called). I have eaten many a dog from one coast to the other and you have to try really hard to screw up a dog. Well, Sams succeeded as these were simply awful. The meat sauce on the dogs tasted like someone had scraped up hot asphalt and slapped it on a dog. It had a burnt taste to it and I threw all three away after one bite then went back out for a burger from Wendy's. It took several drinks of soda to wash that foul taste from my tongue.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-11-29T16:48:31-0500", "location_id": "5075160", "id": "329832789", "user": {"username": "Mike J", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Hot weiners", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54121-d5075160-r301545054-m11068-Sam_s_New_York_System-Warwick_Rhode_Island.html#review301545054", "text": "New York System weiners are 2.50 ea, but if you order 6, the last one is free.
