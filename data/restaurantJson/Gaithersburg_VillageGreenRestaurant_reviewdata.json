As an indication of the value of the place, I'd estimate that 60-70% of the customers are regulars to some degree or other, and the waitresses can greet at least 15-25% of the breakfast customers by name.\n\nThis is basically a breakfast and lunch place - they close at 3 pm.  They're open every day of the year except for Christmas Day & one other holiday (I forget which one).  They have a really good weekday breakfast special and the menu is dominated by breakfast choices.  They also make very good, and large, subs, and they have a small choice of Greek dishes along with some typical American choices.  I recommend the Gyros and the steak & cheese subs in particular, along with the above-mentioned breakfast special.\n\nThe staff has been there forever and is a little \"quirky\" (at least with the regulars).  None of that \"Hi, my name is Branson/Jon/Hilare with an \"e\"/whatever, and I'll be your server today\" type greeting - more like \"Sit wherever you want and I'll get to you as soon as I can\" type of place.
