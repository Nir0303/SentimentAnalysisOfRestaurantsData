There is only one cash register.\n\nThey have a big dining room with a lot of tables.  It faces south so it bright and cheery.\n\nI had the Beer cheese soup off of the salad bar, and it was very good.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-19T06:32:55-0500", "location_id": "905048", "id": "327829702", "user": {"username": "AndyB5542", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Tasty and quick", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43323-d905048-r267307200-m11068-Federal_Cafe-Minneapolis_Minnesota.html#review267307200", "text": "Great burgers and fast service.
