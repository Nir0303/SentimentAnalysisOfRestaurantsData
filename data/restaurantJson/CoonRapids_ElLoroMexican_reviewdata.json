He rushed us while we were ordering & he talked over us when we were trying to ask him questions about the menu. He then got one of our orders wrong & another waiter came and got us the correct plate of food right away, but then our initial waiter came back & had an attitude about the mistake he made. He also didn't check back at our table & ask if we needed anything or refill our drinks. Other than the rude customer service, the food was delicious. I recommend the chicken or beef tacos, chimichanga, & any of the of burritos with queso! The margaritas are great too & cheap during happy hour (medium margarita for only $6.50).

Is this even legal? Which brings up the bigger question - where do the employees wash their hands? My daughter couldn't even use their napkins. They smelled too moldy.  As for the food, the first bowl of salsa was OK. The second, not so good. It had an off taste to it, something like mold. The waiter was unfriendly and short with us. Would have been nice if he smiled.  My wife asked him questions and he wasn't helpful. Wife and daughter ordered chicken and it was so bad they didn't eat it. It tasted microwaved to them. It sat too long. Probably explains why they can't substitute. When they delivered my plate, the waiter had a hot pad on his hand. His thumb was stuck in the middle of my lettuce. Gross. I ate only my pork. All I can say is it was better than the chicken. They were re roofing the place, but that can't explain the uncleanliness. Plus there is NO excuse for no hot water in a men's room. As my daughter said, it truly replicated eating in Mexico...", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-06-28T11:29:12-0400", "location_id": "1212471", "id": "212501302", "user": {"username": "bobbers51", "user_location": {"name": "Coon Rapids, Minnesota", "id": "42973"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Good food, good location", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42973-d1212471-r206173923-m11068-El_Loro_Mexican-Coon_Rapids_Minnesota.html#review206173923", "text": "I met a friend at El Loro yesterday afternoon for an early dinner. As I live 30 minutes away, I hadnt' been to El Loro before. It was a beautiful day and we sat on the patio. The patio was comfortable and private, though the wait staff didn't make it outside as frequently as we would have liked. We each ordered a blended alcoholic drink and they were fabulous. We also each had Quesadillas Rellenas with chicken. The food was fantastic and my friend loved their spicy ranch-like dipping sauce for the endless chips. It was located about 5 minutes from the movie theater which might make this place a regular location for Girls Night Out.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-19T05:58:57-0400", "location_id": "1212471", "id": "206173923", "user": {"username": "LaurenSch", "user_location": {"name": "Hugo, Minnesota", "id": "43182"}}}]}
