I've tried the crispy chicken wrap with fries and their homemade aioli on the sand which is to die for. The fries are great too and we all found ourselves eating every last crumb. I recently had a Cobb salad which was a great portion and great price.  Other diners at my table have had a giant burger with a fried egg and bacon on top, a French dip and the soup of the day.
