When I walked in a little after 12, I was the only customer. I felt a bit rushed to decide by the guy at the counter, and when I asked if there was anything smallish, he gestured to the top of the menu. I chose the single piece of fish with fries. The drink question was also pretty vague - there were several stacks of cups on the counter and a soda machine in the room. I asked what the choices were and he gestured again to the cups, no indication of prices that I could find on the menu. Fish was fresh and tender, chips could've been hotter and crispier, but maybe it was just that I ate my fish before starting in on the chips. Soda refills were 50 cents. Food took a little longer than I would've liked to come out, but at least that means they made it fresh for my order.
