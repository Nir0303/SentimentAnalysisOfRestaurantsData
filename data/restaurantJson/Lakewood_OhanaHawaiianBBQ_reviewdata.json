My favorite is the chicken katsu.  I personally don't order the bbq beef.  It's not terrible, it's just it has too much of a ginger after-taste for my liking, but my family likes it, so it's just me really.  They have good portions and at a reasonable price.  We also get the spam musubi and I like the macoroni salad.  Service has always been great.  I don't know if it's the cooks they have on certain days, but there have been times when I've ordered the chicken katsu and got really dry end pieces.  The spam musubi sometimes has it's issues like others have said; not enough sauce, rice is a little dry or the spam slices are too thin. With that said, if you don't want to drive to Cerritos for L&L or wait for a table at the Loft, this is a good place to get your Hawaiian BBQ fix.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-06-02T14:32:58-0400", "location_id": "5045459", "id": "277377215", "user": {"username": "robustokid", "user_location": {"name": "Lakewood, California", "id": "32605"}}}]}
