The very next day after checking in, a pair of new Gap athletic shorts were stolen from or room by housekeeping.

When we returned to the room that evening, flipflops were still there, shorts were gone. \n3- Before calling the front desk, we flipped the room upside down looking for them. went through every drawer in the room, looked under all the furniture, bed, couch pillows, etc. \n\nWhen I called the front desk that evening, I said I was giving them them the benefit of the doubt and hoping that housekeeping may have swept them up with towels and bedding. She said she would check with the housekeeping manager and get back to me. She called about 10 minutes later saying that no one was available to assist me until the next morning, to call at 9am. I called 9am sharp, spoke with someone again at the desk who said she would look into what happened and get back to me. I told her that it the shorts weren't even expensive, its' just that it made no sense to take them like that. She agreed and said that's totally not acceptable and that she would talk to whoever she needs to so that this issue will be resolved for us. \n\nI never heard back from anyone. My wife and I decided that because we would be doing some shopping that week and bring some new things to the room and combining that with not trusting anyone else at that point, we opted to not have anyone in our room until we checked out the next week. \n\nI also figured that if we tipped at least $10 per day for housekeeping to come in and we would be there 7 days, the loss to that person would be worth more than the shorts that person stole, so in the end, they're the ones that lost... \n\nIn the end though, we're the ones that really lost- because we paid full cost of a stay at the Marriott, got less than what they would've provided for services and someone got to keep themselves a nice new pair of Gap athletic shorts. \n\nNew Rochelle Marriott, save yourselves the trouble of apologizing for the incident, don't offer me any discounts on my next stay, because I'd be an idiot to come back again and risk losing anything else. Just explain the logic to your housekeeping at your next meeting that it would be insanely stupid to steal ANYTHING from your guests because they pack a minimal amount of things, making things very easy to track when missing. \n\nThe only reason why your staff wouldn't give a crap when you tell them this is because they know you do nothing in terms of holding anyone accountable and do nothing to compensate the guest while they are staying there or least at checkout, which would make stealing acceptable to your staff.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-29T06:26:37-0400", "location_id": "224107", "id": "412270450", "user": {"username": "Rey C", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Right down by some entertainment", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48246-d224107-r404644529-m11068-Residence_Inn_New_Rochelle-New_Rochelle_New_York.html#review404644529", "text": "We stayed here while visiting family in the area.

There is also free breakfast in the morning, but I did not get a chance to check it out. I did like that coffee and tea are available in the lobby 24/7. Many Marriott's have eliminated this perk,\n\nMy room was nice and clean. It was spacious and housekeeping did a nice job refreshing my room every day.\n\nI did have an issue with the toilet not flushing. I notified the front desk and the issue was taken care of immediately.\n\nThere was a parkingissue that I  encountered on the last night of my stay. The City of New Rochelle is replacing the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the hotel and access to the hotel from the parking garage  was completely closed off. Not being familiar with the area, I had no idea how to enter the property. At 1am, it was scary, being in a parking garage not knowing how to get into the hotel.\n\nFortunately, there was another lady checking in and a Marriott employee was assisting her. He walked us to a different elevator and directed us a different, unmarked elevator to the hotel. Had I been alone, I would have been extremely upset as this was an extreme safety issue.\n\nIn the morning, at check-out, I informed the front desk of the entrance issue and the General Manager personally escorted me to my car. I did suggest to him to put up a sign for other guests so they would not be locked out. He was very kind, as was the gentleman, Dravie, who helped the night before.\n\nThis property will go above and beyond to correct any issues! Staff is amazing!
