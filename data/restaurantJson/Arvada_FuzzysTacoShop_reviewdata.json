Normally when I go to eat with someone else, sure the food is important, but how about being able to actually talk with each other without saying \"huh?\" every other word due to the \"noise\" level. Waiting in line moved along reasonably, but even the cashier kept saying \"excuse me?\" because she too couldn't hear me over the noise level. It went both ways since I couldn't hear her very well either. \n\nI got a shredded beef burrito and paid the extra money for smothering it with green chili. They take your name and you can sit where you want while waiting for your name to be called. There's one problem though - the noise is very loud and when they call your name the music briefly stops for the PA announcement for whose food is up next. This means that to hear your name being called easily, you need to stand in the area close to where they call out your name. \n\nI went to the table to eat with my friend and he had gotten tacos that were rather small in my opinion although he said he liked them OK. My burrito was nothing special really and the green chili was a waste of money since there was no heat at all in the green chili sauce. The meat was just OK, and there was plenty of food, but it was really very plain. It didn't taste like any Mexican food I've eaten before, perhaps a notch down from Chipotles when it comes to being anything close to average bland Mexican food. \n\nWhen I was in line I asked the lady behind the counter whether they could lower the music down because it was LOUD and she said no. If they did that then no one could hear their name being called. Perhaps they should lower the music and invest in a good PA system but then they would still need to address the acoustics of the place since that's the root cause for the loudness. \n\nI found it too noisy, not friendly for talking with companions, food that at best tasted average to someone that has a lot of experience eating varieties of Mexican food throughout the country. I'm not hard of hearing or have a Superman sense of hearing, it's just that we go to a restaurant to eat and talk and this restaurant is not about that.
