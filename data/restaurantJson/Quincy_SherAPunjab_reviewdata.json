Our experience was too good. We visited this restaurant on Saturday and they have buffet option available at cost of 10$ + taxes.\nWe really enjoyed our food. There was many options under veg as well as non-veg.

He is a vegetarian and eats at this restaurant or takes out from it at least once a week. We have been frequenting it for the last two years.  Anytime we are looking for something different, we gravitate to Sher-A-Punjab.  The service is very good and the atmosphere is warm and friendly.  Some people have objected to the televisions around the perimeter of the restaurant, but I don't find them offensive, just unnecessary.  it isn't a sports bar.  The food is excellent from the papadum and the naan to the variety of spicy dishes. (You can request the level of spice that you want)  We always try something new, but my absolute favorite is the Lamb Korma.
