Very shortly after we sat down at the table, the waiter wanted to take our order. We hadn't looked through the extensive menu yet and asked for a few more minutes. The waiter agreed but took much longer than a few minutes to come back so we needed to flag down what turned out to be the evening manager so that we could order from our waiter. Tuesdays are German night. Two of us ordered German food from the list and the other two ordered evening specials. You would have thought all four of these entrees would have been readily available since they were all evening specials. One by one, we watched every table in our area that was seated after us receive our food before us. The service was very slow. Without us saying anything, the waiter recognized how slow the service was and offered to buy us a drink. Due to the fact that we already had two drinks and would be driving separately, we politely declined. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes to receive our food. Three of us left half of our entrees due to the poor quality of the food. My husband said that it was the worst hot German potato salad that he ever had-thought it was scraped from the bottom of a burnt pan. Again, without us saying anything, the waiter said that he would talk to the manager about adjusting the bill. The bill was adjusted one entree or $15 less. It really wasn't much of a discount for the slow service and poor quality food. We were so disgusted by the poor service that it really put a damper on the evening.

We always consult TA first, and have found some amazing places, whether it be restaurant or hotel. I attended college in Oshkosh way back in 1984 and had never been to the Roxy all this time.  It's rated #2 in Oshkosh, so I was excited to try it for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.   \nOur dinner was rough from the very start.  We ordered the almost required, in order to rate a supper club in WI, Old Fashion.  Our drinks were so watered down and bland, we didn't even have a second.  That is a first for us, I have to admit.  \nWe then had salads, which were fine, and a piece of bread.  After eating the bread, we noticed that the bread had been served on top of crackers which were completely and totally crushed up by whomever they had been served to previously.  They were indeed mangled.  As we discovered this, we thought about the grubby hands that had handled these crackers and left them in this state.  We then remembered that we had just eaten a piece of bread that had been laying right on top of these grubby packages and felt somewhat sick.  \nOur meal arrived shortly afterward and we hoped to forget our previous experience by enjoying a fabulous main course.  My boyfriend ordered a ribeye which was completely and totally plain, without any seasoning.  I ordered chicken cordon bleu, which was more than overcooked and I was unable to even chew the chicken.  \nThe waitress arrived, after we hadn't seen her in quite a long while and asked how our meal was.  Not wanting to be rude, we simply responded....\"ok\".  She asked, just ok?  She asked several times why we just thought our meal was ok.  We very nicely detailed our review of each step of the meal.  She asked if i'd like a box to take home my uneaten chicken.  I kind of chuckled, thinking that if I wasn't able to chew the chicken now (and had left most of it on my plate), I most certainly wouldn't be able to reheat it and attempt to eat it again.  I did explain that I was disappointed with our dinner, especially considering it was my boyfriend's birthday dinner.  \nShe returned after an uncomfortable period of time with our check and to offer us an after dinner drink on the house for our disappointment in our meal.  Honestly, our Old Fashion's had been so poor, we were afraid to even try a drink \"on the house\".  We did opt for a grasshopper, which was very, very good.  The waitress also returned with a small birthday cake for my boyfriend, which was also good.    \nAs many friends have raved about the Roxy and TA's ratings were also so high, we were completely and totally taken aback by our visit.  It was more than disappointing and we doubt we will ever willingly choose to visit again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-06T12:36:46-0500", "location_id": "793922", "id": "435172203", "user": {"username": "Stacie P", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "The Roxy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60168-d793922-r435161520-m11068-The_Roxy_Supper_Club-Oshkosh_Wisconsin.html#review435161520", "text": "The food and service was good.

May I suggest, starting out your dining experience with an authentic Old Fashion or a glass of Piesporter wine.  My favorite menu is the Grilled Portabella Mushroom open face Sandwich loaded with grilled vegetables, Spinach with Bacon Salad, Wild Rice (the best) and grilled asparagus. My husband loves the steaks and fish selections, but then everything at the Roxy is delicious. Be sure to call and make reservations early in the week. Get there early so you can enjoy a cocktail before dinner. Make this your special date night.  Not a perfect choice for young children as the wait can be long and the night truly belongs to you and your date. Take the kids to a more family restaurant where they can be kids.
