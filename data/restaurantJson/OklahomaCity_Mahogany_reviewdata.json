Mahogany came highly recommended so we gave it a try....\n\nFirst the pros:\n\nThe restaurant is in a great central location in downtown, just down from Bricktown. \n\nIt is beautiful, with great ambience, especially at dusk. We were seated in the bar area, and when they open the drapes, the view of the city is really nice.\n\nBread is brought to you quickly after being seated.  Menu has a nice variety of beef and seafood options.  Sides are alacarte, and are huge. We had both the mashed potatoes and steak fries.  Potatoes could have been a little more seasoned, but fries were great-crispy, with just enough salt.  \n\nCons:\n\nWe made a reservation, but were seated in the bar, not the dining room.  We should have been advised of that prior to completing the reservation.\n\nWhile the manager was doing her rounds and seemed to be attentive, our two, yes two, waiters, were not good.  We were seated quickly, and my boyfriend advised that they could take his wine glass away; I however wanted time to review wine list.  Waiter number two came back to get my wine order, but, despite him just having water in front of him, assumed that was all my boyfriend was drinking.  Had to call him over to order a drink, and again for another one, after he waited for ten to fifteen minutes with an empty glass.\n\nRegarding the food, we both ordered a steak, one the 14 oz ribeye, the other the 6 oz filet.  They were ordered medium well and medium rare respectively.  Both came over cooked, but we ate them as we did not wait to get new ones cooked.  \n\nWaiters did very poor job doing regularly timed call backs, we were not asked about dessert or coffee after our meal, and then there was delay in getting our check. \n\nThis place has a lot going for it, but there are areas for improvement, especially when dropping 100+ dollars for a meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-27T15:54:53-0400", "location_id": "8542092", "id": "359157252", "user": {"username": "Mary G", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Do Not Miss This One!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51560-d8542092-r338133866-m11068-Mahogany-Oklahoma_City_Oklahoma.html#review338133866", "text": "The service was outstanding, the portions were generous, the taste and quality of our food was nothing short of perfection.

I think you'd put your best game face on if you were just opening. They have 2 other amazing locations in Oklahoma, why did they put on such a pathetic opening.\n\nI never thought I'd say this about a Lobster Cargot - but don't!! Too greasy, overcooked and with seasoning that reminded me of breakfast sausage. I even left a piece. At $29.99 for 6 pieces . . . well, you know where this is going. But it was so bad, I couldn't eat anymore. \n\nTheir steak was good but not great. If a person likes their steak blue and you age it to long, it loses that luscious rare steak feel and taste. A rare steak should be butter but it was chewy and had marbling in a filet mignon. This made it greasy like a ribeye. In fact, I left some steak behind which never happens.\n\nTheir oscar topping was goo, with nice pieces of crab, but they steamed it and served it over asparagus (which I love, just not with crab.) This completely overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the crab and ruined it. \n\nTheir Bernaise and Chimichurri sauces are excellent. But good sauces on bad food just doesn't suffice.\n\nTheir wine list - especially by the glass - are less than stellar. They have valet parking, which in this location is almost mandatory, and it's $10.00. I don't mine tipping for valet or even paying, but if it's virtually necessary by location, I feel like it's a surcharge. \n\nOn the upside, the staff is well-trained and very attentive. Well, except they lost my reservation in their system. However, they were still able to seat me since this is their newest location and not everyone knows about it yet. Not worth the money or worthy of the Mahogany name. Go to Broadway 10, The George or the other Mahogany location.
