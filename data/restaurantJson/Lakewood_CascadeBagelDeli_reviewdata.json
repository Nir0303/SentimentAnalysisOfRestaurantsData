I usually cannot get past ordering a bagel with FRESH salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onions and capers. Oh my goodness! The bagel is amazing and the salmon is so delicious. Of course, where can one go in the Seattle, WA area and not get a great cup of coffee? Cascade offers hot, dark roasted coffee I love. \n\nThe personnel are well chosen by the owners, as they are friendly, competent which adds to the good experience. If you are a bagel snob because of being spoiled by New York City bagels, you might be pleased to order some from this Northwest deli. I've never seen so many sesame and poppy seeds on any bagel in other places. YUM!!

This plus a couple of really rude looks and also the way she yelled out to another customer and then smack talked them under her breath and in front of my friend and I, just made for a really awful experience.
