The bar food is fairly routine and the drinks are reasonable during happy hour. Their menu has been downsized and the chicken drummies taken off. This was my favorite food so we don't go as often as before. The service is marginal and you should look at your bill before paying it as they overcharge for things you did not get. I don't think it is dishonesty but in- attention to the job at hand by the servers. The place is kind of a dive but that gives it all the charm as I detest \" sports bars\". They do have the usual bar activities such as karaoke,bingo and Texas Holdem poker. The parking is more than ample as the bar sets in a small shopping center. The clientele is mostly blue collar of all types. Have never seen any altercations due to drunks probably because no one wants to drink enough to risk a DWI.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-09T15:27:53-0500", "location_id": "801214", "id": "338778239", "user": {"username": "Dave H", "user_location": {"name": "Brooklyn Park, Minnesota", "id": "42901"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Good time", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42973-d801214-r265859764-m11068-Scoops_Pub_and_Grill-Coon_Rapids_Minnesota.html#review265859764", "text": "This is a good bar with enough room to move around.

It had been a long time since our last visit.  We go out 3 times a week and live in Coon Rapids.  The Happy Hour was of less value than others in the area.  The food was decent and out service was very good.  At the end of our service we were informed that they no longer accepted out DMC card for 1 free meal.  We asked for clarification from the manager.  A very rude bar manager came over and and treated us very poorly and acted like we should know about this.  We asked if there was some sort of compromise.  We had ordered a number of beers.  Don't tell me she didn't have margin to make an offer of a no cost beer or two.  She stormed off and again was rude.  I had to twist my wife's arm to try something different on this trip.  No more back to Anoka were they know what service is.  No DMC cards but good service and a fair value.
