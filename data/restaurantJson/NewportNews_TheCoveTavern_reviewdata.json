You get the impression immediately that she likes her job and believes in her \"product\" or she is simply professional. Whatever it is, it works! She made a recommendation to my husband who simply could not make up his mind and it was absolutely perfect! For the food to live up to the hype would have been a challenge...well, our meal at The Cove lived up to it ...and then some! From the location, atmosphere to the lovely Valencia, it was a great experience that we look forward to repeating! As we were leaving, live music was just getting set-up...so I guess this place really does have it all!

Just catching up. We got there about 7:00 or so and it was not overly busy yet. Our server was new but bright, bubbly, friendly and helpful. We did not mind that she didn't know the beer menu yet!  \n\nOur drinks were delicious (try the X rated Margarita! I have no idea why it's X rated but it was excellent!) and the food was great! Prices were reasonable and our setting and ambiance was very nice too. The restaurant is beside the City Center Fountains and it's so pretty there. There was a fireplace going (chilly evening) and the lighting in the restaurant was low key and perfect. \n\nWe had been once before with family and he hadn't gone again ever. I'm glad we tried again and loved our evening there. \n\nI had the Cuban, someone else had the Seafood Stack, an abundant and gorgeous looking salad, and though I can't remember the name of the fourth dinner, it looked amazing just in presentation. \n\nOverall, definitely recommend!! Great service, wonderful food, drinks were perfect and the atmosphere in the restaurant was on point.  Will make for a great memory!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-04T07:46:01-0400", "location_id": "5264399", "id": "370134834", "user": {"username": "Jennlynnmen", "user_location": {"name": "Yorktown, Virginia", "id": "60775"}}}]}
