The original plan was to pop in for a sandwich and an ice cold coca cola after being on the road almost 28 hours then head on down to the motor speedway to meet our travel deadline.    \n\nThose plans and our bet with Big Enos all went out the window when our food arrived.  I started my meal with the sausage rolls.   Homemade sausage in a puff pastry !  Sweet 5 pound 9 once Baby Jesus, I had to wash that down with a beer.  By the time my braised short rib sandwich arrived I was knee deep in Harp and not looking to be rescued. \n\nMy friend Cledus was traveling with his hound Fred so we opted to sit out front on one of the comfortable pub tables and watch the scenic view of Canton Street residents stroll by.   And I mean scenic\u2026..   Cletus went with the house lamb gyro and chips based on our server Jessica\u2019s recommendation and he was not disappointed.  A generous sandwich with enough house cut fries for even Fred to sample.   Jessica was so kind to even bring a small bowl of water for Fred to wash down his snack.   Fred fancies a good fry.  \n\nThe third member of our group Sally, aka Frog, selected the roasted brussel sprout salad and one of their house cocktails called The Peaky Blinder.   Excellent and Excellent!  Not being a salad man, it was surprising to find myself eating off of her plate during lunch.  Maybe it was the harp making me frisky?\n\nAfter spending a few quality hours out front, Frog and I went inside for a tour.  What struck us most was the beer options.  Over 30 drafts on 2 floors was a nice change of pace from the 400 cases of coors we had just spent hauling thru four states.
