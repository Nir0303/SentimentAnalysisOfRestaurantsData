Our first indication that this hotel has quality issues were all the rag-tag men sitting around the front of the hotel drinking and puffing away on cigarettes.  It made my wife extremely uncomfortable as they ogled her when we walked past.\n\nThe gentleman at the front desk was great and extremely helpful.  We were checked in and proceeded to our room.  When we walked in we discovered furniture that was broken and neither of the television sets worked.  There were also stains on the bathroom wall that looked suspiciously like blood.\n\nI walked down to the front desk, told the clerk, and he immediately gave us another suite.  We proceeded to walk down to the new suite.  We went into the room and discovered that the AC unit did not work in the bedroom.  It was well over 85 sweltering degrees in there.  Not acceptable.\n\nAgain I walked back to the front desk, told the clerk, and we decided that we would go back to the first suite and he'd switch out the broken furniture and try to get the televisions working.  He was able to get one television working by switching out the remote, and promised that the other TV would be replaced the next day and housekeeping would be notified of the cleanliness issues.\n\nThe next morning we checked with the lady at the front desk who assured us that the issues would be taken care of that day while we were out.  When we returned that evening, absolutely none of the problems had been taken care of.  Still no working television, and cleanliness issues in the bathroom were still there.  When I asked the front desk clerk (a different lady), she advised us that it should have been taken care of (it wasn't).  When I asked about the cleanliness issues in the bathroom she said that it was normal for there to be issues in the bathroom, and as a female she understood why there were blood stains on the wall.  What?  Seriously?\n\nI also noticed that the breakfast area is getting extremely shabby-veneer is peeling from the counters, cupboard doors and drawers are broken and hanging askew.   I also noticed that the fire extinguisher in the third floor hallway is out of date for its annual inspection.  There is peeling wallpaper in the hallway and the shards of glass on the floor between rooms 310 and 312 that were there our entire stay, even though housekeeping had their cart sitting right next to it.  The peeling wallpaper would have taken half an hour to fix (seam adhesive and a roller) and the glass simply should have been seen and picked up by housekeeping.  The out-of-date fire extinguisher inspection tell me that management really doesn't care about guest safety. \n\nWe decided to leave a day early because of the issues with this hotel.  While we've always had great service from Best Western hotels, this one falls far short of a quality guest experience.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-16T06:27:07-0400", "location_id": "251039", "id": "419144548", "user": {"username": "Pop R", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Very Nice", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56260-d251039-r418799877-m11068-BEST_WESTERN_PLUS_McKinney_Inn_Suites-McKinney_Texas.html#review418799877", "text": "We had a nice stay.

After lying that her manager Cindy turns her phone off at midnight, I told her it was only 23:45 and she changes the time to 23:00.  She said that no one higher than her can be called to fix the problem, she was new, and was not trained on how to work the computer.  She even stated there's been worst life threatening scenarios and was not able to call anyone at that time.   I told her we just got back from the airport and I would rather trudge through the two hour drive home then stay in a place as disorganized and rude as this BW.  This location should be called BuTT WiPES for the nerve of a night auditor to yell and argue with a customer who was trying to find a solution to something than wait in the morning till someone would be available.  She guaranteed me if I was to go home that she can have the manager Cindy reverse the charges she made and even approve Priceline to cancel the reservation.  I knew better what bull crap that would be cause I was not about to risk falling asleep at the wheel to drive home to just waste the money I've spent and not get a refund for anything.  When I called Priceline in the morning to see what they manager had decided, they denied the cancelation, and that no apologies or attempt to talk to me directly.  The hotel looks decent from the outside and pictures but I should have known that no BW would have any standards or actual decent amenities, breakfast, or accommodation.  Their towels had stains, beds were very uncomfortably, breakfast was a joke, those Texas Waffles are non existent, toilet would not flush, and there are no hospitality in the front desk and manager.  Anyone wants to do a class action law suit, hit me up, and we will force these idiots to get their acts together.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-13T01:10:24-0400", "location_id": "251039", "id": "404786878", "user": {"username": "TheManVerdan", "user_location": {"name": "Tyler, Texas", "id": "56797"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Good night sleep", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56260-d251039-r400617865-m11068-BEST_WESTERN_PLUS_McKinney_Inn_Suites-McKinney_Texas.html#review400617865", "text": "Very nice hotel.

Their A/C in half their suite was NEVER repaired for their 3 night stay, but part of the suite did have air. Several other people we spoke to were also without A/C and no maintenance people showed up all weekend to fix it. In our \"Suite\" I was to stay on a hide a bed couch. I pulled it out and it was ripped and had a huge stain on it. The photos I took are cringe worthy. I went to the desk to ask for bedding, a mattress pad or something and was told they were out. I was given 2 sheets. So I slept on the couch folded up which was not comfortable at all. The next day they provided me a roll away bed which required a pillow under one side of the mattress to make it level enough to sleep on. This I paid 149.99 per night for. We called other hotels to try and get out of there, they were all booked up so we were stuck.

Go somewhere else!! \n\nThe owner is a complete jerk and threatened to call the police on us because we want the AC fixed. He told his manager \"why won't they just leave?\" We would love to but there is nowhere else to go!!! \n\nThis has been and continues to be the WORST hotel experience I've ever had!! We paid for a king suite with a pull out bed because we have two babies that need separate rooms. When we arrived, our room felt like a sauna. Neither AC unit was working and the two cribs we had called and reserved (one reason we chose this hotel) were nowhere to be found. Night staff eventually (2 hours later) let us move to a different suite but failed to mention that there was no pull out bed. So with no cribs and no pull out bed, we now have 4 people in a room with one bed when we paid extra specifically for the suite. But wait... It gets better!! One of the 2 AC units in our new room is broken, so we are still sweating. We can't close the bedroom door (and separate the babies) because there's no AC in the living room. It's been 48 hours and the \"maintenance\" that would supposedly be here \"first thing in the morning\" has yet to show up. They're \"having problems with him\" but refuse to call someone else. There are no other rooms, the hotel is booked solid, and no rooms at surrounding hotels so we are literally stuck with nowhere else to go.  \n\nSo after two nights of sleeping on a small couch with my 1.5 year old, I am completely fed up. The owners solution is to give us $20 off.... This room should have been $20 less to begin with as its smaller and is meant for 2 people, not 4. That's not even considering the lack of air conditioning in TEXAS in JULY! \n\nThis is the worst I've ever been treated by a business owner/management and it's very clear they don't care about their customers.
