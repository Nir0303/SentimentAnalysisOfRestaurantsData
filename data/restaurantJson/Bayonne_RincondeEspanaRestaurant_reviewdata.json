Besides it's only two blocks away, so we could walk there. I'm accustomed to the great Spanish-Portuguese restaurants in Newark's Ironbound section, where I used to live, so my expectations of that cuisine may be a bit high. Service was fine at Rincon de Espana and prices are reasonable. The food was good. I wouldn't say it's outstanding, but I would conclude that you will get competently prepared Spanish cuisine at this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-07T03:36:24-0400", "location_id": "5220680", "id": "307740492", "user": {"username": "NJWil", "user_location": {"name": "Bayonne, New Jersey", "id": "46290"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Gret place for lunch and dinner", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46290-d5220680-r292066620-m11068-Rincon_de_Espana_Restaurant-Bayonne_New_Jersey.html#review292066620", "text": "Very nice place\nGreat food and big portions\nVery good house wine.\nAnd very reasonable prices\n\nWill go again when will be in the area", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-24T08:09:28-0400", "location_id": "5220680", "id": "292066620", "user": {"username": "analitik1958", "user_location": {"name": "Lansdale, Pennsylvania", "id": "52978"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Yum!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46290-d5220680-r261679660-m11068-Rincon_de_Espana_Restaurant-Bayonne_New_Jersey.html#review261679660", "text": "Best shrimp and garlic ever!
