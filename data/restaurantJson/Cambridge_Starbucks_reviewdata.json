Sure, its not the *best* coffee (which is of course just opinion anyways) but its decent for such a large chain. I have the fancy app and the \"Gold\" level card, all that stuff. My point being, this wasn't my first time in a Starbucks, I've visited them in many states, all the way from their original location in Seattle to this one in Boston.\n\nHowever this location has been a fairly bad experience both times I visited. On both occasions my drink was made incorrectly. A friend had told me this location had Almond Milk (which turned out to be entirely wrong, obviously no fault of Starbuck's), and when I went in I ordered a drink with Almond Milk and based on their reaction was given no indication that this was an issue. Upon receiving my drink I was given a drink with Soy Milk, which I didn't realize until I started drinking it. I asked about it, and the barista said that she figured she would substitute it since it was \"pretty close!\" Sorry, but not really. Thankfully I have no soy allergy, but what if I did? Starbucks would not be in a good spot. \n\nThe second time my drink wasn't the one I ordered, at all, but they called my name and it was on the class. They fixed it, but I waited 3 times as long for the fixed drink as I did for the original drink (which makes no sense since the drink I received was a more complex drink).\n\nAnyways, I still like Starbucks, but I've been avoiding this location. Both times it was the same people working when the mistakes were made, so maybe I'll give them some time to either shore up their training, or get fired.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-01-08T12:07:07-0500", "location_id": "4727509", "id": "248340116", "user": {"username": "Charles T", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "el clasico", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d4727509-r271224068-m11068-Starbucks-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review271224068", "text": "muy rico todo lo que vende esta cadena de cafes , muy barato y el servicio es muy bueno, el lugar en amplio para compartir con amigos se puede pasar un buen momento", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-05-10T18:48:02-0400", "location_id": "4727509", "id": "271224068", "user": {"username": "Fernando L", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Cercano a metro", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d4727509-r225128808-m11068-Starbucks-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review225128808", "text": "Afuera del metro \"Harvard\" puedes encontrar Starbuck.
