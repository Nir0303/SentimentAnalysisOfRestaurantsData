It turns out that the owner, David, was in his first week there.  Since this is a new owner I am putting in his new phone number, 757-606-2151, in case it has changed.  This is not typical carry-out fast food.  Most things are cooked to order with surprisingly high quality ingredients.  For example, Friday had macaroni and cheese as a special and it was cooked using 3 types of aged real cheese.  The Carolina-style barbecue is terrific, and yesterday I had a poppy-seed toasted bagel with bacon, egg (real eggs), and cheese with Columbian coffe.  Because he cooks everything this is not a 2 minute wait on your meal, particularly if many of the office people have called in orders ahead of you, so it is good to call ahead to put in your order.  David says that soon he will be able to post his menus and specials on Facebook.
