Helps to loosen any tense muscles after packing, unpacking, and carrying lots of things that could make muscles tense. \n\nJust had another 2hrs massage today with Rita. She is amazing and is able to do deep tissue as well as Swedish massage. Was so relaxed that I fell asleep. She's also very engaging and makes great recommendations between massage appointments. \n\nI highly recommend Elements massage for ongoing massages. I also recommend trying different therapists as each one has their own way of working with you.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-04T21:29:36-0400", "location_id": "3475788", "id": "401548420", "user": {"username": "Arlene E", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Elements Therapeutic Massage", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33146-d3475788-r225301391-m11068-Elements_Massage_Sunnyvale-Sunnyvale_California.html#review225301391", "text": "Birthday gift #5 from the Husband: A membership to one of my favorite ways to pamper myself - a Swedish massage. \n\nI had an amazing experience and I highly recommend the place - really courteous and highly trained staff, an extremely soothing decor and they play beautiful instrumental music.
