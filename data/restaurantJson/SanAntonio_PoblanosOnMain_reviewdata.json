I try to research and plan where I\u2019ll eat, read some reviews, look at the menus, etc. That usually works quite well for me, with the only exceptions being when I just can\u2019t find the place, give up, and settle because I\u2019m starving.\n\nWhen I was recently in downtown San Antonio, I began the research on places to get a great, authentic Tex-Mex meal for lunch. Needless to say, there is no shortage of places serving that in this area.  Which made the research even more important. I was only going to be there for 2 days\u2026I wanted the best food possible. I\u2019d had an excellent Tex-Mex meal 2 days before, so this one should equal or exceed that one.\n\nWhen I saw that Poblanos on Main was just a few blocks (walking distance) from the hotel, and it was tex-mex, I wanted to know more. So I read the reviews. I did not find one single review that gave this place a 3, 2, or 1. All reviewers rated Poblanos 4 or 5.  What? ALWAYS before there is someone dissatisfied with something!  Maybe the silverware on the table wasn\u2019t straight, or the salt didn\u2019t pour on the first shake\u2026SOMETHING!  But not here!  4 or 5 across the board. Well..I was hooked\u2026I HAD to go there and see what this place was all about! If for no other reason than the uniqueness of having NO average or below reviews.\n\nMy GPS is my best friend. I use it everywhere. However, it was a little tricky to use it in San Antonio, because of the Riverwalk; sometimes you need to be street level, sometimes Riverwalk level, and I hadn\u2019t quite figured it out yet. So by the time I found the place, I was definitely hungry.  \n\nWalking in reminded me of a school cafeteria. You order and pay at the front window from a men posted overhead behind the counter.  Your receipt assigns the number\u2014which is called when the order is ready. There are no servers, definitely not \u2018fine dining\u2019 in the service sense, but I venture to say fine dining in the food and value sense. I ordered Enchiladas Poblano having no real idea what they\u2019d be like. They were the best ever!  Their own cream sauce covering the enchiladas was to die for! The chips (which don\u2019t come with the meal and need to be ordered too) were fresh, thin, made there in the restaurant, and the sauce was just like I love\u2026hot spicy, smooth and flavorful.  There was everything good and nothing bad about the quality of the food, the taste, and the price. What an outstanding value for such a quality meal. Sure, you have to walk to the counter a few times, but it is a small sacrifice given the meal you\u2019re about consume. And sure, it requires a little searching and scratching the head while looking at GPS, but in the end it is totally worth it.  I\u2019m only sorry I wasn\u2019t in town long enough to try one of their breakfasts. I can only dream about them until I get back to San Antonio next.  This place will be a must stop from now on!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-01T08:11:23-0400", "location_id": "2712855", "id": "388156984", "user": {"username": "ioumore", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great Authentic Mexican", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60956-d2712855-r386256614-m11068-Poblanos_On_Main-San_Antonio_Texas.html#review386256614", "text": "Good food at a fair price, no frills.
