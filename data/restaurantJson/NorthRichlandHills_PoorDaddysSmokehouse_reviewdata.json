Not great, but definitely good. This is east Texas BBQ style BBQ. I've been twice so far and it's pretty close to my job. Small place, maybe about 8 or 10 tables and booths to sit at. Ordering is cafeteria style, then you pay and sit and enjoy your meal. Condiments and sauce are next to the drinks after you pay. Fair prices, so no problem there.\n\nI tried the ribs on my first visit. Good color, no bark to speak of really but the outside was a think dark good smoky looking skin. They were fall off the bone if that's your thing. On my second visit, I tried the brisket and hot link. The hot link was fine ground and had a nice red casing to it. No memorable flavor, but it reminded me of hot links I used to eat when I was younger. I think I like Earl Campbell's links a little better. I asked for moist brisket, but I think I got some flat instead. Was good, but not what I prefer so I'll pass on the brisket next time.\n\nRanch potatoes are kind of bland, so won't be getting those again. BBQ beans are good, not much sauce in there which is OK by me. Default bread is a piece of buttered Texas toast.\n\nAll around it is a decent place.

I particularly liked the hot links.  Prices are high though.  I couldn't believe how much a sandwich and a half-pound of meat with no sides cost me.  Biggest problem is understanding the people that work behind the counter.  We had serious communication issues; I couldn't understand their grammar and heavy accent and they couldn't understand my English.  No problem if you don't ask questions and order by the number straight off the menu board though.\nLiked the rustic small BBQ shack interior.\nI\u2019d go back for more, just have to save up some money.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2011-10-10T06:13:37-0400", "location_id": "2318492", "id": "119141727", "user": {"username": "RT1000", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Worth, Texas", "id": "55857"}}}]}
