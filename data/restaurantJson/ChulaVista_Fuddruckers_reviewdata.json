We loved it, the taste, the service, the decor, it was al superb.\nWhen we roadtripped through Baja Mexico in 2014, we popped over the border for a day to San Diego. We really wanted to eat at Fuddruckers again. Imagine our surprise when we heard there wasn't a Fuddruckers anywhere near us (San Ysidro). So we went to the city center, again no fuddruckers...we had to go to one of the outer neighbourhoods of San Diego (La Mesa or in our case Chula Vista) to get to a Fuddruckers. This meant, getting on a train, taking a bus and walking another few miles. When you do this trip later in the evening, it's not so pleasant, we feel that those neighbourhoods weren't suitable to walk around safe... \nSo: Fuddruckers: open a restaurant nearby the citycenter or the malls please :)\n(and on your website, add a section \"how to get here by public transport\"", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-27T05:45:50-0500", "location_id": "362316", "id": "251258216", "user": {"username": "Sterrenvis", "user_location": {"name": "Brugge", "id": null}}}]}
