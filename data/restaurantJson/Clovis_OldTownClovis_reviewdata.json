The stores feature and old town traditional aesthetic and have their own country town charm all their own. In-fact, Clovis today, looks more like an old cowboy town than it did when I was a kid who actually \"grew-up there.\"  The change is welcome and the folks for the most part are friendly and cordial. But, law enforcement has little tolerance for social deviants who would act foolishly. It's just not acceptable behavior in this neck of the woods.   The restaurants and shops are open and close at reasonable hours. The streets are well paved, clean, and easy to navigate. I believe that the town has become a bit more socially acceptable to individuals and families from diverse backgrounds, so yes, things seem to be going well for Clovis in 2016.
