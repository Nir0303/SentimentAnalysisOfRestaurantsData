They had very tasty steak bowls and fish plates, very reasonably priced. However, the quality of the steak has really gone down. I mentioned it to them on the subsequent visit from the first time it happened. They said they would be sure I got good quality steak. However, it was basically the same. I haven't gone back again. I will give it some time and then try again. So unfortunate. Their prices are good and their staff is incredibly friendly. I hope they can pull it together.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-15T15:38:08-0400", "location_id": "8663927", "id": "364476556", "user": {"username": "Reservation4Four", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Very fresh", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33250-d8663927-r334258161-m11068-Hilo_Volcano_Grill-West_Covina_California.html#review334258161", "text": "I've been there for a first time since this month.
