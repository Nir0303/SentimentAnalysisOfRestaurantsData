And while we were having lunch, we saw the planned menu for that evening- it was restaurant week in Schenectady, and decided to come back for dinner.  The owners and staff were a lot of fun, and our meals- both for lunch and dinner- were great.  The restaurant will begin dinner service in reality as of mid-march, 2016.  They took advantage of the restaurant week and opened for dinner for that special event a bit early.  We can definitely recommend the cheese board appetizer, and the french onion soup crostini.  The chicken piccata was delicious, as was the stuffed portobello.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Jeanette M, Owner at Bel Cibo Fine Gourmet Foods and Spices, responded to this review", "text": "We enjoyed your company and look forward to seeing you again!
