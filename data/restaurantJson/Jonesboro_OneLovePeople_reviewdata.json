The owner was busy preparing lunch for other customers and said she'd be right out. I was greeted by her son. You can tell this place is family friendly and that they care.  \n\nShe offers coconut milk, almond milk, 2% and 1/2 & 1/2. She suggested coconut milk with my iced coffee and I loved it. I brought my daughter back in a few days later and she remembered me. \n\nThis is such a cute place to hang out. There are a few artsy items for sale and some board games you can play. Sometimes there's music as well. \n\nI didn't see a menu and was told she was working on it. She had gluten-free and grain free items for purchase.
