They have a few card tables and folding chairs if you do want to eat in, but you are much better off getting your food to go and taking it home, eating in your car, or drive a few blocks south to Lime St. Park and have a picnic. The IN-House dining area is small, and fills with folks waiting for their orders at meal times. Call your order in ahead to save time when you pick it up.\nMany super good choices on the menu ! One of the best are the Pork Carnitas, large cubes of roasted pork usually 2 inches to a side look like building blocks--you apply the sauce after you get them wherever you're going.. The Beef and cheese Burrito is another winner. You can buy Tamales buy the dozen. We really like the Pork filled ones.\nThe restaurant is located across the street from the BNSF Mainline RR to L A. Often train crews will halt their train at the signal light here and run across to pick up an order they called in from up the road earlier.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-01T18:01:38-0400", "location_id": "4627042", "id": "277108511", "user": {"username": "MayorAl42", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Delicious Little Dive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32491-d4627042-r262176543-m11068-Casa_Delicias-Hesperia_California.html#review262176543", "text": "The people are nice and the food is excellent!
