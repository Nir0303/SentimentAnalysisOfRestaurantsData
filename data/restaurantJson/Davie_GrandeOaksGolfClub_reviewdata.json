It was in great shape.  Got on and off rather quickly.  I played many years ago.  It is much better than the days when Caddy Shack was filmed their (old rolling hills).  Lots of mature trees and a island hole that will challenge every level golfer.  It was very pricey but, I had to play it again and loved it.

Lauderdale traveling alone on business.  I asked the concierge to recommend a golf course, and he set me up with the Grande Oaks.  It was about a 25 minute drive inland from the hotel.\n\nThe course is well gated.  Nobody can enter until the receptionist clears you and opens the imposing gates.  Once inside, valet parking for your car and hand delivery of the clubs.  The clubhouse is very elegant - quite nice.  The pro shop staff is friendly and courteous.  Included in your round is free use of the driving range, which is a short golf cart ride from the pro shop.\n\nThe course lays claim to being the location where the much of the movie \"Caddie Shack\" was filmed.  But don't hold that over them - nor let it push you to expect too much, or too little.  Overall, this is a very nicely laid out course.  It has water, but not insane amounts like can happen in south Florida.  As a 15 handicapper I found the course VERY playable from the member tees, and would greatly enjoy playing it again.  If you are a scratch golfer knock yourself out from the back tees - as the added length will challenge your accuracy.  This is a course that requires skill, not just the ability to hit the long ball.  Better to play your control clubs than try to be a bomber, or you'll have some tough second shots.\n\nThe day I visited the high was 50 degrees, so there was almost no one on the course.  I think on warmer days it may well be more crowded.  But, if you can find a way to gain admittance I thoroughly recommend Grande Oaks - it is a good experience and fairly priced.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-12-16T06:45:01-0500", "location_id": "281449", "id": "244692350", "user": {"username": "Adam H", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "Dinner Event was Tops!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34227-d281449-r150071551-m11068-Grande_Oaks_Golf_Club-Fort_Lauderdale_Broward_County_Florida.html#review150071551", "text": "Our church school held a dinner fundraiser at Grande Oaks and it was superb.
