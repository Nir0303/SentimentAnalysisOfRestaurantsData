All the previous TripAdvisor reviews talked about Happy Hour so our 1am experience is only representing the late-night scene at the Righteous Room.\n\nThe interior of this long & skinny bar is actually decorated quite well with a red ceiling and a nice-looking bartop.  However, there is only a 3-foot walkway between the bar stools and the booths on the opposite side.  So it is almost impossible to navigate this place as there was a good size crowd near the bar trying to fight for a position to order drinks.\n\nIn addition, the music in this place was VERY loud.  When I looked around the place, all I saw were people taking gratuitous selfies or texting friends.  It was depressing to see that no real social interaction was taking place inside the Righteous Room.  We walked out without ordering any drinks.\n\nHappy Hour at this place may be a totally different and a much better experience.

I have not been there during the times that others describe as a \u201cmad crush\u201d, when the younger and prettier crowd come out to haunt the downtown bars. My experiences have been all pre-theatre, partaking of the Happy Hour specials before heading across the street to the Aronoff for an evening of theatrical entertainment. So, with that in mind\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s shotgun style \u2013 narrow with a dark bar on the right, and a group of tables in front, back and along the left wall. During Happy Hour, which runs from 4:00 until 8:00, Monday through Friday, all drinks are half off. Not just some, but all of them. That means a pint of Guinness Draft is only around $2.50 or so. For any bar, that\u2019s amazing. For a downtown bar, that\u2019s incredible. Consume Guinness at home and it\u2019s almost $2.00 per pint. \n\nThey don\u2019t serve food, but that\u2019s really not a problem being downtown and within walking distance to most anything you would want. Their draft and craft beer list is pretty impressive, and there is always something new to try. The spirits selection is good, too, with lots of top and mid-shelf liquors to choose from. The specialty drinks are pretty standard, but, from what I\u2019ve seen, and by sitting at the bar, I can tell you the bartenders are not shy when it comes to the pour.\n\nThe atmosphere itself is dark, dim, romantic, and often a little loud. It\u2019s the \u201csleeve rolled up, tie loosened\u201d type of crowd that permeate the downtown bars after work.  It\u2019s not intimidating for anyone, young or old, although it trends towards the 20-somethings. During Happy Hour, there are Plenty of \u201cafter work\u201d groups there, and by 8:00, many of them have been sipping (or guzzling) their adult beverages for hours. I\u2019ve yet to see anyone loud or obnoxious, even when it has been pretty crowded. The bar staff, both male and female, often look like they are ready to leap into a photo shoot of Cincinnati\u2019s Hottest Servers at any moment. I have yet to see an unattractive server working the wood.\nOverall, they seem to be pretty knowledgeable, a problem one often sees when dealing with younger staff. \n\nWhile you are there, be sure to check out the back bar. It is pretty impressive. Some very beautiful glass and light in that magnificent piece. This place looks like it goes back a ways, and it\u2019s an interesting part of the local downtown history. So if you\u2019re looking for someplace to drink on the cheap after your workday, before the show, or if you just wish to mingle with the pretty people, this may be the place to go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-04-03T07:46:38-0400", "location_id": "5834821", "id": "199770879", "user": {"username": "GregS18348", "user_location": {"name": "Blue Ash, Ohio", "id": null}}}]}
