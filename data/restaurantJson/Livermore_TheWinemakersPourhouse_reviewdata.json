We walked by this place and thought it looked very cool - and we love wine, so wanted to go in a see what is was all about.  They had live music out back too, which also drew us in.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have much more insight to offer on the place.  We walked in, walked to the back where the music was to see if there was any seats - there wasn't.  Standing room only, and not much of that, so we just headed back inside to sit as we saw a couple empty seats on our way by.  We weren't too disappointed - the music was pretty loud anyway, and the inside looked very nice too.\n\nWe found a table inside and sat down.  And the we sat...and sat...and sat.  No one acknowledged our presence - ever.  This is my number one pet peeve at a restaurant.  And we are actually patient people - we sat for about 10 minutes, as we were in no rush, but after that we just got up and left.  Too bad, because we were excited to try it out!\n\nThere were several people working behind the bar, and we got glanced at a couple times - but that was about it.  At one point, what seemed to be the manager or owner, came over to the table next to us to chit chat with the folks there, but even he didn't seem to notice that someone sat down.  Come on guys, get it together.  Your restaurant isn't even that big - be aware of the situation and what's going on.  \n\nOn a good note, we left there and went a couple doors down and had a great wine experience.

We were pleasantly surprised by the welcoming vibe of this place.  There was patio seating in the front and back of this restaurant.  We decided to sit out back under the canopied patio and were delighted to learn that an Irish Blue Grass band was playing that evening.  The temperature was comfortable and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.  They offered us suggestions on the best wines and cocktails and we were not disappointed.  We decided to pair our drinks with appetizers and enjoyed both immensely.  We chose the Syrah Poached Pear & Brie Crostini and Apricots and goat cheese and crackers.  All was quite reasonably priced.  The combination of the drink, food and the band made for an enjoyable end to an evening.
