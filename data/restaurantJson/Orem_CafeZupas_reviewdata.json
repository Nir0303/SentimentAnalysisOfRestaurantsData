The prices do not match the product, I feel they are a tad high for what is delivered.  I have never been impressed with the experience I have had at this location. On several occasions I have had to clean the tables myself or re-clean, after the staff has bused the table. I often get the feeling I'm being served by the soup nazi when going through the line. Please do not get me wrong, the food is the normal delivered at a Zupas, but the delivery of the management and staff is lacking.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-29T10:27:32-0400", "location_id": "4080755", "id": "293784035", "user": {"username": "SLCPete", "user_location": {"name": "Orem, Utah", "id": "57093"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "One of our favorite places to eat, but wish the soup was hotter than lukewarm", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57093-d4080755-r284522447-m11068-Cafe_Zupas-Orem_Utah.html#review284522447", "text": "Everything about Zupas is terrific except for the fact that nearly every time we eat there, which is quite often, the soup is not as hot as we would like it to be.
