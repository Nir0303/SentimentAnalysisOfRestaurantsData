That is my advice. The walls are grimy, the tv is loud, and the food, while quite tasty, is very expensive for such a dump. It is not really a restaurant: It is a neighborhood take-out stand with  three small tables, so the place seats six. No silverware; just plastic. Paper napkins. The woman who works there, Ren\u00e9e, is very grumpy until you warm her up with some jollying. She is very deficient in explaining just how to order and just what you get.
