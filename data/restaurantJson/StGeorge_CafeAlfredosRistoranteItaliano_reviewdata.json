They are sure trying hard and there are so many plusses, the ambiance, the music, the decor, the facade, the helpful and friendly staff and extremely friendly owner/head chef. However, a restaurant really boils down to the food which is unfortunately quite poor.\n\nI ordered the \"special,\" which was far from it--butternut squash ravioli. The presentation was abysmal, so much sauce the ravioli was complete drowned and not visible on the plate. Our food was delivered suspiciously speedy (within 5 minutes) which, in addition to the taste, was solid confirmation that it was likely frozen a few minutes before. It just looked like a plate of sauce and tasted like something I could find anywhere else, including the grocery store.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but the food just isn't good. There's a lot to love here, however, their point of existing is food and it's bad. Over-toasted bread was difficult to eat and cut the roof of my mouth, with oil and balsamic that was clearly store-bought and very tart, full of sugar. For the authentic \"fine-dining\" image they sell, it's swimming in medium grade sauces and equal to, if not worse than any commercial-grade frozen Italian food.

Given I was not impressed with Piccolo Mondo, I was hesitant to try his latest venture, Chef Alfredo\u2019s.  Because there was a large group of friends going (about 30), my husband and I decided to go along and give it a try.  Chef Alfredo\u2019s is in an older house that has been converted into the restaurant.  It is made up of several rooms and our group took up two of these rooms.  Because of the group size, Chef Alfredo gave us a limited menu from which we could select our meals.  Prices ranged from $8+ for salads to $20 for Five Cheese Ravioli, $28 for Great Grandma\u2019s Seafood Ravioli to $35 for Fettuccine Alaska.  There were 3 salads and 6 mains from which to choose.  Desserts were $7 each; there were four.  The meal included only bread (our basket, for our table of 4, had 6 small pieces and was never refilled, despite asking).  We were allowed to order a \u00bd salad (split one) but when my husband and I asked to split a main we were told \u201cno\u201d we could not.  Not even with a split plate charge.  I was so taken back by this that I did not think to just order a salad and let my husband order a main so we could then share at the table.\n\nI order Rigatoni Mona Lisa (\u201cBolognese Marscalpone Sauce, with sausage\u201d - $22); my husband order Italian Sea Bass (\u201cMarinara Sauce, Roasted Tomatoes, and garlic.  Served with home made pasta\u201d - $28).  Our Caesar salads were adequate, but contained a rather high percentage of past prime greens and a lackluster dressing.  The cheese did not seem freshly grated.  My rigatoni was mostly al dente but there were also undercooked noodles.  About half the sausage was overcooked.  The sauce was some type of red sauce with a heavy mascarpone component.  It looked like the same sauce that was served on our friends\u2019 seafood raviolis and on their five cheese raviolis.  My noodles and sausage were swimming in the sauce.  My husband\u2019s sea bass was properly cooked but it too had more sauce/topping than it should have.  The fish was lost in the sauce.  The spaghetti that came with the dish was dripping in olive oil and undercooked.  \n\nChef Alfredo\u2019s does not yet have a liquor license and therefore no wine list (despite this restaurant being opened nearly 2 years and a wine list showing on their web site).  Before the meal a server said that because they do not have a wine list yet, they would be serving a \u201cspecial grape juice\u201d for us.  \u201cWould anyone like to have some\u201d \u2013 the server did not say there would be a charge (and shame on us because no one asked).  Those who accepted the offer (most) were served about 2 to 3 ounces of the \u201cspecial grape juice\u201d in a red plastic cup.  At the end of the meal when it came time to pay we were charged $8.00 per drink.  We told the waiter we thought the drink was complimentary (everyone we talked with told us they also thought it was complimentary because of the way it was presented by the wait staff).  The waiter said the restaurant will be charging much more per drink when they get their license but that he would talk with Chef Alfredo about our concerns.  We did not get the charge deleted or reduced (I pity the people who had 3 drinks each).    \n\nGetting the bill at the end of the meal was an exercise in itself.  Apparently the staff had not kept track of who ordered what (when the food came out the staff would carry it in and say \u201cWho order \u2026\u201d).  After the meal the servers came around and asked everyone what they ordered then they went back to the kitchen and figured out the bill for each person/couple.  It took about 30 minutes to receive our bill.  Given the disorganization, and the quality of the food (one would expect much higher quality given the prices) I don\u2019t think we will ever go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-06T14:28:28-0400", "location_id": "7115499", "id": "389895611", "user": {"username": "PattyDoggie", "user_location": {"name": "St. George, Utah", "id": "57119"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "No ambiance average food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57119-d7115499-r388231670-m11068-Cafe_Alfredo_s_Ristorante_Italiano-St_George_Utah.html#review388231670", "text": "A Sicilian owner /chef that has been away from Italy too long.\nHe has become Americanized in his cooking and presentation.\nThe best part was the calamari and shrimp appetizer although the marinara sauce was more of a diavolo sauce (very spicy).The calamari was served hot and lightly battered but well done.\n\nI had the branzino but was disappointed because it wasn't the whole fish and it was fried.

One of my favorite ever restaurants is in a similar setting in Palm Springs (Le Vallerius) and this place was a very comfortable setting. We went early on a Wednesday so we were the only ones there (bonus) and the hostess/server was very friendly. Alfredo came out as we were ordering to explain what was on the menu and to answer our questions.\n\nOne of the things we always order when eating Italian is a calamari appetizer. Both my wife and I felt Alfredo's was one of the better dishes we have ever had, and we have had calamari literally across the country and on both coasts. He gets his seafood fresh from SoCal and his appetizer is outstanding. The calamari was cooked perfect, and was crispy and not tough. His red sauce was for sure the best we've had, but fair warning - it does have some kick to it. We like food a little spicy so it was just how we like it. As a bonus, he includes several (6) large shrimp cooked to perfection.\n\nMy wife had the catch of the day which was Sea Bass with a fettuccine in red sauce. It was excellent. I had the 5 cheese ravioli and it too was some of the best I've had. The portions were very big, and my teen daughter got a meal from our leftovers when we go home. \n\nIn the future we plan to go for lighter dinners. A Caprese salad and sharing the calamari would be plenty of food.\n\nMy favorite all-time Italian restaurant is Filomena Ristorante in Georgetown, DC and based upon my first experience at Cafe Alfredo's he is pretty close.\n\nOh yeah - we got a couple of Cannolis to go. They were very good.\n\nI'm not sure what happened to the patrons who had negative reviews, but for sure try this place if you like Italian.  I rated it as fine dining as we ordered appetizer, dessert and the specials which hiked up our tab, but there are several entrees at very reasonable rates.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-20T19:20:41-0400", "location_id": "7115499", "id": "365904658", "user": {"username": "RSinSG", "user_location": {"name": "St. George, Utah", "id": "57119"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Totally hand made from scratch.

The woman in uniform who greeted us seemed harried.  She left some dirty cloth napkins and glasses on the desk that serves as the \"hostess station\" while she went off to find a table for us and the group that arrived moments before us.  The restaurant didn't seem busy but it was at least 15 minutes before someone returned to take us to a table.  The dirty napkins and glassware still lingered at the hostess station.\n\nWe were seated at an odd table where my husband had to squeeze by another diner to get to his seat.  There were obviously empty tables in other rooms, some of which had not been cleared and cleaned yet and they stayed that way for our entire meal.\n\nThe server was very polite and apologized a few times, remarking that there had been two groups of 11 that night.  Hmmm, inadequate staffing?  Both employees (the \"hostess\" and the waiter) appeared to be very busy when we saw them hurrying to and fro.\n\nThe menu had perhaps 8 or 9 different wines listed, priced by the bottle and by the glass and there were 4 other \"house\" wines by the glass as well.  I ordered a glass of wine and was told that all that was available was one white and one red wine.  At first I thought I'd misunderstood the waiter but no, of the 12 or so wines offered and well-described in the menu, only the anonymous merlot and white wine were available.  I thought maybe they'd sold out of the wines but it appeared that the menu had \"vapor-wines\" as in, they'd NEVER been offered at the restaurant.  The waiter politely mumbled something about waiting for the license or something which made me wonder if the restaurant had only just opened for business??  \n\nWhen we ordered our main courses, I asked about the side dishes, salad or soup and the waiter politely told me that the main course came in such large portions that I wouldn't need/want a side dish.  I have to wonder now if those were \"vapor-dishes\" as in they didn't really exist.\n\nI ordered the butternut squash.  I've had it in other restaurants but this time it was served in a red cream sauce which almost completely covered up the delicate butternut squash flavor.  The dish was also served with Parmesan cheese on top.  The portion was very large.  I would have preferred a smaller portion, no Parmesan cheese on top without my requesting it AND I would have liked to have a small, elegant salad.  \n\nMy daughter ordered the spaghetti with meatball and ate it.  My husband had the lasagna and liked it too.\n\nMaybe this restaurant hasn't found its identity.  If it's going to be a fine dining establishment, it has to have side dishes to complement the main courses.  It also MUST have more choices of wine.  It also should have adequate staffing and the ability to keep the tables clean.\n\nIf the restaurant is going to be successful at what it serves, the menu needs updating immediately.  It is completely misleading as it is.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-31T15:07:14-0500", "location_id": "7115499", "id": "336307964", "user": {"username": "Morningsatthebeach", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Cruz, CA", "id": null}}}]}
