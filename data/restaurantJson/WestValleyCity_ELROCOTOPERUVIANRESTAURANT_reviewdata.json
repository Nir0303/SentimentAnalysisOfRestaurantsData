Our favorite dish\u2014 Pollo a la Brasa (A style of Peruvian Chicken served with salad and fries) has recently gone up in price. This initially was understandable and wasn't a big deal (with the economy and all more than understandable), because the value initially was so good. The price hike really didn't phase us, it's what happened after that left us feeling bad.\n\nToday we ordered, as take out, Pollo a la Brasa. The man whom is either the owner or a manager was the very one to fill the bag for the take out. I didn't look at each individual container because all of my past experience had been very consistent in terms of the quantity and quality of the food. I took it home (a 50 min ride) and when we served it up (a family of three, with the third being just a toddler) both the visual and physical volume of the french fries was notably less than half what we were accustomed to receiving.\n\nNormally I'd just take an issue like this up directly with the management of an establishment, but when it so clearly was the manager that was the final deliverer of the food I'm hard pressed to believe that a quite petition would help.\n\nThe thing that hurt the most was just that we felt like we'd found a reliable restaurant with good food at a great value. I hate the feeling of having to keep tabs on those I patron to feed my family.\n\nCan't say we won't go back. The food's quality and flavor is awesome. But I can't say they will be providing our next Peruvian fix. Nor that they will remain our favorite source in Utah of Peruvian food.\n\nHemos sido clientes del restaurante cada mes o dos tras las ultimas tres a\u00f1os seguidos. Nuestro plato favorito\u2014Pollo a la Brasa recien se subio el precio. Eso en si mismo no fue una problema (del hecho con la economia como es bien razonable), no nos importo porque el valor dado en la comida fue tan bueno. Asi que no fue el hecho de subir los precios que nos dejo amargos sino lo que paso despues.\n\nHoy dia pedimos un orden de Pollo a la Brasa para llevar a casa. El hombre que me lo entrego, creo que es duenio o jefe principal, fue el mismo que lleno nuestro bolsa. No revisa las cajas del orden porque nuestro experiencia hasta entonces siempre fue uno constante con respecto a la calidad y cantidad de comida. Lo lleve a mi casa (una viaje de 50 minutos) y encontrabamos que las papas que nos dieron fueron la mitad o menos de lo que nos habian dado antes. Eso fue obvio en la aperencia fisica de las papas y en el hecho que no nos llenaron para nada.\n\nPor lo general, en casos asi, empezaria en forma privada contactar el los que manejan el negocio para avisarles de la situacion, pero cuando el mismo que se junto y me dio el orden es el a quien estaria reportando no veo la utilidad en eso.\n\nLo peor es que pensemos que habiamos encontrado un establecimiento de calidad y valor. Odio la sensacion de que tengo que siempre estar revisando para evitar que alguien esta provechando de mi confianza o que piensen que solo porque tienen lo mejor en algo que se pueden provechar de los que les apoyan en otras cosas.\n\nNo puedo decir que no nos regresamos.

Tampoco que quedaran nuestro destino favorito para comida Peruana.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-06-05T00:11:08-0400", "location_id": "2390223", "id": "163043965", "user": {"username": "Ethan P", "user_location": {"name": "Ogden", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2013-05", "title": "Not That Good!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57168-d2390223-r160016866-m11068-EL_ROCOTO_PERUVIAN_RESTAURANT-West_Valley_City_Utah.html#review160016866", "text": "Looks bad on the outside and inside, and taste doesn't make up for that.

Although the restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside the food inside makes up for that deficiency. \n\nLast week I took a group here for lunch and as we walked in I could tell they were feeling skeptical. Only one person in the group had tried Peruvian food before and no one knew what to expect. I assured them the food would be delicious and then started hoping it would be... Thankfully the food was great! \n\nWe started off with Papa a la Huanca\u00edna, a traditional dish of boiled yellow potatoes in a spicy, creamy sauce called Huanca\u00edna sauce. If you're new to Peruvian cuisine, you seriously need to try this dish! Peru is known for their potatoes. In fact, there are about 5,000 potato varieties worldwide and 3,000 of them are found in the Andes alone! Why's that? Well, would it surprise you to know the potato was first domesticated in Peru? \n\nFor the main course I ordered one of my favorites, Lomo Saltado, which is basically a stir fry of thinly slicked beef with red onions and tomatoes served over a bed of fresh, homemade french fries and white rice. The Lomo Saltado had a great flavor and was well prepared. Unfortunately some of the beef was a little tough and fatty, but overall it was a good dish. To drink I had chicha morada, a sweet Peruvian beverage made from purple corn. Chica morada is usually made by boiling corn with pineapple, cinnamon, clove, and sugar. It may sound like an unusual drink but it's really good and worth trying out. Order it by the glass or by the pitcher.\n\nI don't remember what everyone ordered, but I knew two people ordered Tallarin Al Pesto Camarones, which is basically spaghetti with a spinach, pesto sauce. They said it was very good. I think it included a thin cut of beef or chicken. \n\nOverall I was really happy with El Rocoto. If you want Peruvian food this is a good place to go.

Recommend if you like Peruvian Chicken, especially if you are in the west side of Salt Lake City.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-03-08T07:48:09-0500", "location_id": "2390223", "id": "154025175", "user": {"username": "hankwill", "user_location": {"name": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "id": "60922"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-01", "title": "Great seafood", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57168-d2390223-r148915455-m11068-EL_ROCOTO_PERUVIAN_RESTAURANT-West_Valley_City_Utah.html#review148915455", "text": "My friend recommended this restaurant a while ago; I finally took my family for dinner on 1/5/13.

I shared the fried seafood platter with my 13 yr old daughter and was more than enough food for two people, tender fried pieces of fish clams shrimps accompanied by 3 kinds of dipping sauces two of them were a little too hot (spicy) for my taste. My son (teen age) had the fried chicken with the fried yucca (starchy, tuberous root extensively cultivated in South America), he enjoyed it very much. Next time I definitely have to try the rotisserie chicken that most of the other patrons were ordering. \nFor a family of four we spent less than $45 dollars with drinks.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "El Rocoto P, Manager at EL ROCOTO PERUVIAN RESTAURANT, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for your time  ..... thank for you review  we want to see you soon back", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2013-01-08T20:01:14-0500", "id": "149225280"}, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-01-05T10:07:08-0500", "location_id": "2390223", "id": "148915455", "user": {"username": "NicaFeroz", "user_location": {"name": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "id": "60922"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-10", "title": "excellent flavors", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57168-d2390223-r141963876-m11068-EL_ROCOTO_PERUVIAN_RESTAURANT-West_Valley_City_Utah.html#review141963876", "text": "we've been to this restaurant a few times, but today everything was great, we ordered the rotisserrie chicken, it comes with fries (which we ordered crispy) and a  salad (which we had tossed), the portion is huge, and the bird was so moist and flavorful.
