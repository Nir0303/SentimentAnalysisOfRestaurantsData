Most of the tables were dirty but we finally sat at the least dirty one. I got the feeling that we had come in right after their lunch rush.\nBack to the food. The grilled shrimp were truly jumbo and were fried with onions and bell peppers which were on my plate with the shrimp. Delicious! In most places the grilled vegetables would have been one of your side dishes. The fried shrimp were breaded with a very tasty tempura type of batter and were also jumbo and delicious. The fried okra were typical fried okra out of a bag but tasted good. The french fries too. The cole slaw tasted a lot like that at Long John Silvers (a good thing.)

The building is actually a bit of a dive, but the food makes up for it. The fried jumbo shrimp were big, crispy and golden brown. My husband had a combo that included the jumbo shrimp, plus fried catfish and fried chicken tenders, all of which were good. Both meals came with a choice of two sides and hushpuppies. We had the fries and mac & cheese, which were average. My husband loved the hushpuppies, but I thought they were just OK. The portions were huge, and each of us took home leftovers.
