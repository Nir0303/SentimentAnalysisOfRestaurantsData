It seemed clean and the staff was friendly.  I ordered Pad Thai with veggies.  It was either that or veggie fried rice.  Perhaps other menu items could have been made vegetarian, but it was a typical, non-veg friendly menu.  They do not serve tofu or any other vegetarian alternative.  That said, I ordered Pad Thai, which is not a favorite dish of mine anyway, but didn't have much choice.  My husband ordered jerky and rice.  It was about 25$.  It seemed a bit high in price...until I opened the package at home.  There was a ton of meat and rice, which was a little over 10$.  My husband gave it 3 out of 5 stars as far as flavor.  He said it \"tasted less gamey\" than Thai House (His usual spot for jerky and rice).  I can't decide if that was a compliment or not?!  My dish was...meh.  It seemed super-saucy compared to other pad thai's-almost re-minded me more of chow mein, but sweeter.  I squeezed extra lime on it to counter-act the sweetness.  The veggies seemed fresh, and it was MOLTEN LAVA-HOT.  THE FOOD WAS SO HOT, IN FACT, THAT IT BURNED HOLES INTO THE STYROFAOM PACKAGING!  We placed the order, and not even 5 minutes later we had our package and were out the door.  The swiftness of filling our order made us question just how fresh our food was...WILL I RETURN?  Probably not.  \"Bagan\" is another 2 minutes down the road and seems much more authentic and fresh and has tofu!  :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-04T12:50:10-0400", "location_id": "411968", "id": "263641278", "user": {"username": "tumbleweed_travels", "user_location": {"name": "Amarillo, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Good food Good Price!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30165-d411968-r128563239-m11068-Chiyo_s_Oriental_Restaurant-Amarillo_Texas.html#review128563239", "text": "Good food Good price and Good service!!
