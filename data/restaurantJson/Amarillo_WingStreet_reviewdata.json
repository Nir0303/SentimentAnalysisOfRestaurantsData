They are not presented with any flair and seriously, kind of boring. Even the wait staff is boring and average.  But, if you like a quite, low activity place, this could be the place for you.

Did not want a burger, but thought pizza would just take too long. Decided to take a chance on this location anyway. The young man at the counter told me it would be about 10-15 minutes, and kept his word. My pizza came out piping hot and was delicious! The interior was very clean and a large area. More than anything, I wish I had gotten the name of the young man who treated me with such caring....he is truly an asset to this establishment.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-02-18T18:02:32-0500", "location_id": "5091631", "id": "255130044", "user": {"username": "Guymon", "user_location": {"name": "Oklahoma", "id": null}}}]}
