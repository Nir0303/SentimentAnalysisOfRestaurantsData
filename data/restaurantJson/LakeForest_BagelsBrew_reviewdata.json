Often there are long lines at peak times. \nRecently a \"text order\" or \"call in order\" service was implemented but don't bother. It takes more time and a lot more frustration than waiting in line. You still have to wait in line to pay for your text order. Often the register that is supposed to be for text orders is closed, especially when busy, but there is zero communication to customers to let them know register is closed. Employers simply ignore customers waiting in that line and expect you to figure it out on your own. Even if register is open and you pay there, the communication between employees that you have paid for your order is lacking. I have been asked to pay for different parts of same text order multiple times and challenged each time to prove I had paid for whole order. Additionally, since order comes out piecemeal, and is kept behind counter, it becomes difficult to get any employee's attention to give lagging parts to you.

I'm not a huge bagel eater but I have friends who are, and are discriminating (and won't hesitate to criticize if the food is poor!), and they've praised the quality when I've taken them there. One friend who lives in Irvine now makes it a regular stop when he's in the area. I enjoy the Bialy bagel and the egg bagel, however I prefer their pastries, of which they usually have a good selection, better than any of the remaining local coffee places. I've had several of their breakfast and lunch offerings including egg dishes and sandwiches and they are excellent. pricing is very reasonable, in fact it's about the cheapest place for breakfast and lunch around, especially when you consider the quality ingredients. I recently discovered they serve lattes and other specialty coffees created with almond milk. That is a boon for me as I've gone from lactose intolerant to full milk-allergic so it had been years since I'd been able to enjoy a latte. Our local Starbucks doesn't offer that option, just soy milk which I think tastes terrible or worse, coconut milk. So another reason to visit. They have a good selection of brewed coffee reasonably priced.
