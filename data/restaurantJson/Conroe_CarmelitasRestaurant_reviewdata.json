The place is nice and easily located in Conroe. The food is ordinarily as far as I can tell at daily lunch buffet. Not too much too chose between but all is good and home made. Of course it's Mexican style. This is NOT Tex-Mex. Which is good for some times.\n\nI was really surprised that their food was almost too salty. You NEVER get that at the usual Tex-Mex/Mexican restaurants around here. They ALWAYS lack seasoning. Here the salt might be a bit on the heavy side but still good.\n\nStill the food was great. I have not tried a la carte but it would be good too I guess.\n\nI recommend you to go here to try something different than the ordinary tex-mex restaurant. Just do NOT add salt to your food until you taste it ;o)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-08-22T15:50:52-0400", "location_id": "4717128", "id": "408972562", "user": {"username": "Bo A", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Don't miss this small hideaway restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55667-d4717128-r284546376-m11068-Carmelita_s_Restaurant-Conroe_Texas.html#review284546376", "text": "What a great place to enjoy lunch.
