The bed didn't have a blanket or sheet which I doubt I would have used anyways since the room was so filthy. Bugs coming out of the walls, ashes on the table when we arrived. Bathroom looks like it had never been touched. It was absolutely horrible. There's way too much flaws to speak. Yeah it's $65 a night but definitely not worth it. Someone should call a health inspector because this place is not fit to run a buisness.
