We were visiting from out of town, friends that live in area took us there.  We, and they, won't be back.  Not for nothing, but the manager did take $25 off our $100+ order after being asked for some kind of compensation.  That made up a bit, but we won't be back.  Don't know what people in the area consider good, but this wasn't it for us.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-20T08:46:29-0400", "location_id": "612048", "id": "301520891", "user": {"username": "CRBug", "user_location": {"name": "San Isidro, Costa Rica", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Slow Service but Amazing Food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36505-d612048-r296940454-m11068-Giordano_s_Pizzeria-Orland_Park_Illinois.html#review296940454", "text": "The service time when dining in leaves a lot to be desired, but the wait is worth it!
