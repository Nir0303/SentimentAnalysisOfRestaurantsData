Duh.\n\nSince the prices are published on the website menu, I don't know how people can complain about price.  If it's more than you're comfortable paying, find somewhere else to go.  I always did until this past Friday, when I could justify it because of a special occasion.\n\nHost was friendly, almost overly so.  The waitress was efficient and helpful, though not what I'd call outgoing.  Specials were outlined sufficiently.\n\nTheir beer is consistently good, so no issues there.  Wife had the pork steak/chop and I had the ribeye.  Both were outstanding, and properly served on heated plates.  Cheese plate was great, and the cured meats were especially good.  The goat cheese polenta cake that came with the ribeye was outstanding.  Dessert?  2 more beers, please.\n\nAll in all, a great meal in a fantastic space.  The nicest restaurant I've been to in Green Bay by a million percent. Two snaps up.  \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-17T00:20:45-0400", "location_id": "471716", "id": "406451655", "user": {"username": "Fielding_Mellish", "user_location": {"name": "ORD", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Poor menu", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59929-d471716-r404092371-m11068-Hinterland_Brewery_Restaurant-Green_Bay_Wisconsin.html#review404092371", "text": "The menu for dinner was limited.
