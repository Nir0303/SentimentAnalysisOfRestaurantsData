Pretty cool really.  \n\nThe selection of bottled of beer was impressive.  It would be nearly impossible not to find something you want to try!

The tap beer selection had a good variety and I opted for a local favorite of Yuengling, which is not something I can get in the Midwest.  \n\nI had \"just a burger\", and my, was this certainly cooked with love.  The taste and freshness was top notch for a burger.  (I'm pretty finicky when it comes to giving burgers a high review rating!)  The sweet potato fries were as good as any fried food could be.  I think I'll make the trip back their soon just for those fries!  Also included at our table was a beef deli wrap and a few \"banjo pig\" sandwiches.

Lots of beers...both in bottles and on tap, always friendly helpful service and usually no wait for a table. the menu is limited but not your usual bar fare (ie, NOT a menu full of fried stuff). We had the chips and dip, Cuban sandwich, salmon gyro and the fried baloney sandwich. Something for everyone!! \n\nIf/When you go, I would suggest walking thru the bar and sitting outside. There's are tables, if you want to sit down, and also a bar, if you want to hang-out there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-28T05:02:32-0400", "location_id": "2514751", "id": "398364446", "user": {"username": "Zach_Silver_87", "user_location": {"name": "Port Washington, New York", "id": "48435"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great Night Out", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60969-d2514751-r398208018-m11068-Backyard_Ale_House-Scranton_Pennsylvania.html#review398208018", "text": "Relatively good prices, had a great night out with friends!
