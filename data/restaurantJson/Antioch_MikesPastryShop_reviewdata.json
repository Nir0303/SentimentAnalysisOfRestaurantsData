This morning I was headed for the SB when I had to park a little further down the strip mall because the limited parking in front of SB was full. I wound up in front of Mike's. It almost looked closed because of the dark (too dark) sun shading on the windows but the little neon sign said \"OPEN\" so I thought, \"what the heck...let me go see what they have\". I didn't want to stand in line for coffee and some pastries anyway and there was no one in Mike's.  \n\nAdmittedly it's been a while since I've been in this little local bakery...more than a couple of years. Not even sure if it's the same owners because I noticed one of the showcases, that was once filled with cakes and pastries, was covered over with a sheet or tablecloth and all of their goods were in the first 2 cases. Looks like they've cut down on some of their variety. \n\nAnyway, I looked around a little and found one of my favorite treats...Apple Danish. They only had 2 left so I bought them both along with an Almond Raspberry Tart for my husband. I also picked up a few of their GORGEOUS muffins...a Double Choc, Fresh Peach, Lemon and Maple Bacon to bring to my breakfast meeting. \nOMG!!  Everything was so good!  Everything I bought was wiped out..I was lucky to get 1/2 of my Apple Danish and a bite of a muffin (the fresh peach was to die for!)....everyone loved them and kept asking where I bought this delicious stuff. Someone even ate my husbands Almond Tart!  \n\nI am just amazed that the Starbucks, just a few doors away, was so busy and this lovely, delicious bakery was empty. Their baked goods are no more expensive but are just so much better. They are fresher tasting and seem to be made with higher quality ingredients. They also sell coffee and have tables & chairs inside for people to sit.\nI am definitely going there for all my baked goods from now on. My next purchase will be a birthday cake for the hubs. All the cakes and pastries in the case looked delicious...especially the Chocolate Mocha Cake, which is what I will order. Have no idea of prices but if they are as good as what I've tried already, I know it will be well worth it.\nJust as a note, I was in at about 9:30 am and they didn't have a whole lot of breakfast pastries left. Not sure if they had already been really busy or if they just don't make a lot because they're not that busy and are trying to avoid waste. So, I would say if you want more than just 1 or 2 items you should call in advance and order it or get there early...you won't be sorry!\n\nTRY this place people! Don't let the only independently owned, made from scratch, REAL bakery in Antioch go away due to lack of business. These are the kinds of businesses we need to support as a community to keep our neighborhoods thriving and to give us the choices we deserve.   Otherwise all we have are grocery store, corporate chain, mass produced, mediocre stuff to choose from....like it or not.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-09-10T11:10:02-0400", "location_id": "6558129", "id": "228147309", "user": {"username": "Vickiefromca", "user_location": {"name": "Antioch, Ca.", "id": null}}}]}
