It is well done, extensive, and very \nrepresentative.  There are about five rooms containing artifacts from the previous eras:  \nold dolls, iron slave collars, balls and chains, lists of slaves for sale and their \nprices, photographs, newspapers, KKK documents, etc.  Staff are very cordial.\n\nThis museum probably gets few visitors because of it's location off the beaten track.  \nYou won't just stumble onto it.  You have to look for it to find it.  And there is no \nparking in the immediate vicinity except for handicapped parking and we are told that \nparking tickets are given out to anyone parking illegally.\n\nAll visitors are required to secure a visitors parking decal from Parking Services located at 2400 Wahnish Way, south of the baseball stadium.  Parking Services is located in the same building as the FAMU Police Department and Physical Plant Operations.  The telephone number to Parking Services is 850-561-2204.   There is a parking building somewhere a few blocks from the museum.", "helpful_votes": "8", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2011-10-20T14:30:54-0400", "location_id": "207949", "id": "119530886", "user": {"username": "Spirit", "user_location": {"name": "Neptune Beach, FL", "id": null}}}]}
