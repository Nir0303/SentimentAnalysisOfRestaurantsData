I hate to say that it gets worse every time I go. I keep going back thinking that the cook must have had a bad day, or someone didn't show up leaving the place short-handed. But today was so awful that I am done coming back (I'll go to their location on 50th Street instead).  Today, the restaurant smelled like beer and smoke and just bad when we walked in. We are used to the dated decor, so that isn't a issue. We were placed a room with one other group who was almost done eating. We waited for 10 minutes as other staff, including the hostess, walked around us cleaning and talking, I.e. Not even acknowledging our existence. As we decided to leave thinking no one was going to wait on us, a waitress working the only other table with customers asked if anyone had helped us. Another waiter, Tom, was apparently assigned to our section and apparently was nowhere to be found. She was kind and waited in us, later only to be chastised by a man I assume was manager of some sort who noted that her cleaning was not all done (she was cleaning when I heard the comment).  She was polite and worked faster.  \n\nMy chicken salad was awful.  There was so much dressing that I couldn't tell the difference between the croutons and the bland chicken. I ate a third of it. The calzone was unevenly cooked and small. The onion rings were great, as always. The sub and fries were okay. We do usually order pizza here.  That is all one should order if coming here. \n\nTo add to the cruddy food and environment, the staff (other than the gal waiting on us) was disheveled and several folks not looking professional kept going and out of the kitchen area. It made me wonder if our bad food was made by them. \n\nI only recall one other restaurant review that I've given a rating like this. But after probably 10 chances over a couple of years giving the benefit of the doubt, I will not go back here again. \n\nThe only bright light was the young lady who covered for Tom and waited on us.

The waitress did a fine job. Our order took more than 30 minutes to arrive. We were told by our waitress our food had been taken to another table by mistake so they were making fresh food for us. At on point the man wearing the purple shirt who seated us had one of the wait staff by the arm pulling her to the kitchen. The food was fabulous but the atmosphere was strained at best.
