The restaurant is small, but has excellent food for dinner and lunch.  My wife and I often have the beefeater salad with balsamic vinaigrette and the wonderful thin-crust pizza.  Often, they have a great seafood special such as sea bass (one of my favorites) and sea scallops, and the value, in addition to the delicious flavor, is excellent.  A nice but small wine selection complements the menu nicely.\n\nThe space is small and intimate.  There are about 12 tables in a line, and an equally long bar with about 15 places.  The atmosphere is vibrant.\n\nThere are no reservations here, so there is occasionally a few-minute wait for a table.\n\nThe service is smart and attentive.\n\nGreat place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2009-06-18T08:11:55-0400", "location_id": "1467474", "id": "32610583", "user": {"username": "mcconthebus", "user_location": {"name": "Decatur, Illinois", "id": null}}}]}
