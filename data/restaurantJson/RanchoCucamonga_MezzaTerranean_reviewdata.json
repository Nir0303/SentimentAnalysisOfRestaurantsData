We split the Fattoush Salad and an order of Chicken Kabobs, as well as an extra order of Hummus and 2 Baklava's. The staff is extra friendly, courteous, and tells you when you arrive: \"thanks for coming back\". Wow! most places don't pay attention to you when you dine at their establishment occasionally. The place is small, and we could really use a top-notch restaurant like this in Fontana, but it's worth any wait you may have. When we first taste the food we look at each other and say: Umm, Umm, Umm! I will go out on a limb to say that, I don't think that there is a restaurant with more \"flavorful food\" as Mezzaterranean! They have they the \"Old-school\" taste- excellence of a mediterranean restaurant with a \"New-school\" vibe. We smile when we even talk about this restaurant to our friends and colleagues. They definitely are \"The new rising\" restaurant of Rancho Cucamonga.
