The owner is a really nice, friendly, down to earth guy who obviously has a knack for whipping up very tasty recipes.  I have unsuccessfully tried to recreate his addictive creamy spinach artichoke soup myself.  That stuff is ambrosia.  The wraps & quesadillas are phenomenal, as is the house made dill dip for the kettle chips they serve.  They have a chicken wrap with Carolina mustard sauce, bacon & onions that is one of the best sandwiches I've had the pleasure of eating!  The quesadillas are always nicely grilled til the outside is good & toasty.  The Italian Stallion is one I recommend.  I love the clever names they come up with!\n\nThe in house baker makes marvelous, fresh baked good every day & his specialty is scones.  They are fantastic!!  They also sell locally made, vegan treats, such as espresso twinkles.  Really!!  Quite good.  \n\nEven if you aren't a coffee drinker, Ohio Coffee Co has such great food that you won't regret going there.  They're located on the ground floor of the large office building on the southwest corner of third/main in downtown Dayton.  I believe it's the 5/3 building.  There is underground parking, which I very strongly recommend if you're driving there, so as to avoid the parking meter gestapo and gauntlet of thugs that sometimes envelop the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-11-04T14:10:58-0500", "location_id": "4089334", "id": "183581270", "user": {"username": "midwestmomdotcom", "user_location": {"name": "ohio", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "Coffee and more", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60785-d4089334-r169621869-m11068-Ohio_Coffee_Company-Dayton_Ohio.html#review169621869", "text": "This is a great place to sit and enjoy a really good latte.
