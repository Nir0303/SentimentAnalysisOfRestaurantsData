Four of us had drinks at the bar, til our other friends arrived..then we sat at our table. Our waiter came over and introduced himself, WISHED me Happy Birthday+told us he'd be \"taking care of us\" and boy did he, and \"NOT\" in a good way!..Ordered some more drinks...and that was the last we saw of OUR waiter for about 15 minutes..I literally had to wave my hands and shout hello to get his attention..(also tried to get the attention of several other waiters,to no avail). I even said to our waiter this isn't going well,did you forget us..waiter apologized..but things got worse. Ordered.. apps & salads, food came out very slowly, food was good, til that point..then another long lag..maybe 30 minutes..one couple who dines there regularly, their steaks weren't good, my girlfriend wanted to send hers back, but hubby said mines not right either..but just didn't want the hassle of sending food back,probably because it would have taken so long to get our waiter's attention. Had ordered a baked potato with my lobster..no potato..and then another couple sat with NO FOOD..Finally someone came over and said the chef didn't like the way their steak looked and was preparing another one..it would just be a few minutes..by the time we were almost thru dining..their food came out..and we asked for our potato..One couple ordered a souffle and our waiter brought out a cake with candles my friend had brought..they took the cake back, and that was the last we saw of it, I'm not kidding for 15 minutes..then someone came over and said the chef wanted to add berries and whipped cream..finally the cut cake came out..\nIt was great being with my friends on my birthday, but we all said something was \"off\" at Viande Rouge, last nite..It was one of the couple's first time dining there, the one's whose steak didn't come out til late..upon leaving we went to our car and some young kids were there smoking+drinking beer in the parking lot..using our Lexus as a bar table..It may be awhile if I ever want to go back.

West & Daniel were phenomenal server!! West, is the one who was telling me some of the fun factoids about the place. We had a wonderful experience from the beginning to the end of the night. Everything & everyone was so polished and more importantly, pleasant. I observed Richard & Ryan-- who i dubbed 'the super servers' because they were hard at work every time I saw them!\nErin, the manager on duty, was a magnificent manager! Her and I talked & agreed that although this place is extremely romantic,\u00a0it is also family/kid friendly because everyone is so warm and friendly.The staff knows the regulars by name! Paul was also one of the hard working server that assisted us towards the end of the night. I love the private room the party was in. The main color of the restaurant is red and it is timeless! What a wonderful evening! See you guys again soon.

The atmosphere was wonderful, cozy, very \"rouge\", and formal enough to make the occasion feel special. The crab cake was delightful for an appetizer, though small and difficult to share. The fillets were filled with taste, and prepared with a grilled flavor that was enjoyably unique. There are perhaps one or two other places in the Duluth, Roswell, johns Creek area that I feel have better cuts and offerings of beef, however VR's was nothing to scoff at for sure. The souffle was a little under done, but we did move through our dinner rather quickly. The waiter was very informed and attentive. It was slightly unusual to be told that our wine selection would require them to walk down to the liquor store?? - perhaps convenient for them, but did I need to know that? Overall a great anniversary experience, and one we would return to for a nice private dinner.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-24T10:52:54-0400", "location_id": "2136184", "id": "358227477", "user": {"username": "bulick230", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta, Georgia", "id": "60898"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Best steak ever", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34913-d2136184-r356491520-m11068-Viande_Rouge-Duluth_Georgia.html#review356491520", "text": "bone in filet is fantastic.

Appetizers - cheese fondue and baked oysters were perfect!  Lollipop lamb chops, Beef Bourguignon & Steak Diane - cooked right at the table, now this employee was entertaining and made the tableside service worth it!  We all enjoyed our entrees.  Asparagus was less then desirable.  For dessert the chocolate cake is so light and was perfect.  Banana Fosters was cooked right at the table again and we ensured the same employee came back to entertain us.  There is a small private dining room in the rear. Ladies - be careful with the floor, we found it to be slippery when walking.  The ambiance of the venue was rouge just like the namesake.  Tables were not on top of one another to hear other peoples conversations.  A hidden gem in a shopping strip that is definitely worth it.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-28T12:44:00-0500", "location_id": "2136184", "id": "351680927", "user": {"username": "sjccheer", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta, Georgia", "id": "60898"}}}]}
