Although movies focus on other groups who suffered during the Bataan Death March, this powerful monument reminds everyone the unique connection New Mexico has to that time in history. The morning we were there, a group of Filipino families and their friends were celebrating the 70th Anniversary of their Independence-June 12, 1946. We were even invited to join them in their special picnic. Please take the time to find this simple, yet amazing monument which honors those who fought for the freedom of all.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-13T08:35:09-0400", "location_id": "10432062", "id": "382205057", "user": {"username": "Vicki S", "user_location": {"name": "Kansas City, Missouri", "id": "44535"}}}]}
