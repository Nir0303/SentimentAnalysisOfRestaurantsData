We met up with friends who live in a different part of the country and we all met up in Washington DC and stayed at the Double Tree by Hilton, 1515 Rhode Island Ave NW, Washington, DC 20005, USA. The hotel s nice and central. It is situated equi-distant between Du Pont Circle and Macpherson Square metro centres.\n\nThis Double Tree by Hilton is adjacent to Scott Circle Park. My husband and I took a junior suite on the 7th floor. It was to the front of the hotel, so it was a little noisy, especially at the wekends, however, the room had pretty views over the park. This was clearly, once, an upscale hotel in downtown D.C. and is only 5 blocks from the White House. However, it would now benefit from investment.\n\nThe carpets are a bit worn, the colour schemes are dated and the furnishings have seen better days. However, our suite offered really good value for money and our friends, who took a standard room, were also satisfied. The rooms all have large, flat-screen TVs and WiFi (for which there is a small fee if you are not a Hilton Honours member) The beds are large and comfortable. All suites add separate kitchen and living areas and ours also had a granite wet bar and a large bathroom.\n\nThe bistro is disappointing. It serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, but it is dark, dull, dated and understaffed. It offers contemporary American cuisine which is tasty, but the menu never changed the whole period we were there. There is a bar which has a \"Happy Hour\" lasting around 4 hours! It serves signature drinks and is busy and clearly popular. Unfortunately, it too suffers from dated furnishings and understaffing.  The amenities of the hotel also include a fitness center, valet parking (for which there is a fee) and a business centre. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms spotless. I did like the big, fluffy bath towels.\n\nHaving said all that, this Double Tree by Hilton benefits from the most charming, helpful and dedicated staff. The majority of them could not do enough for us. Only one or two seemed to be going through the motions. The staff of the Double Tree by Hilton, 1515 Rhode Island Ave NW, Washington, DC is a great asset. We were all made to feel welcome and valued. At present this is a good hotel in a great situation with great staff. With some investment and modernising it would be a great hotel too. I will use it again, and recommend it.\nValerie Penny", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-02T12:14:28-0400", "location_id": "120559", "id": "434088144", "user": {"username": "Valerie P", "user_location": {"name": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "id": "186525"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Guest Beware", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28970-d120559-r433258247-m11068-DoubleTree_Hotel_Washington_DC-Washington_DC_District_of_Columbia.html#review433258247", "text": "When I arrived I was given a room.

However, I was disappointed the entire 4.5 day stay with the lack of hospitable service from the dining staff, eagerness to get paid/tipped but not provide friendly service, and the lack of actual cleaning in the guest room. Cracker crumbs and a plastic shard of something unidentifiable were found in the bed, and after being placed on the nightstand were never taken away. The floors never appeared to be vacuumed, even after use of the bathroom. The same was true for the hallways and dining area.  I am generally a pretty easily pleased guest at hotels, and often stay at places much simpler and inexpensive than a Hilton hotel. Therefore, I expected more from this kind of establishment and did not see that. A family member staying at the hotel next door, a recognizable chain but with cheaper pricing and a generally well-liked but less \"fancy\" reputation, was a far better experience for family members that stayed there than our experience here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-13T06:03:35-0400", "location_id": "120559", "id": "427836777", "user": {"username": "jessicadE4651ZW", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
