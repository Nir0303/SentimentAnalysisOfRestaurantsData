You can sit down to eat, but for me this is take out only. I mean it wasn't bad, just pretty run down. I also know this can mean a mom and pop place with great food, so I looked past all of that to focus on the food...\n\nI decided to try the Bun which is cold vermicelli noodles with veggies, grilled meat and fish sauce. So, I ordered the grilled pork with crispy shrimp and pork rolls. The grilled pork was tender, moist and nicely seasoned. The crispy shrimp and pork rolls were quite good, some of the best I've had. The veggies seemed more like a restaurant side salad than Chinese veggies, so that fell a bit flat for me. The fish sauce and vermicelli noodles were good and the meal was very reasonably priced at $8.25.\n\nSo if you're looking for atmosphere, this is not the place. But if you are looking for some decent carry out at a reasonable price, then this is worth a try. And get the crispy pork rolls because they are a winner.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-26T06:20:47-0400", "location_id": "10253783", "id": "367799006", "user": {"username": "Ctomsa", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
