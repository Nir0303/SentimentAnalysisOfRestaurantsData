Its life probably began In the late 1950s or even early 1960s, but without the history of its origin it is difficult to pen down.  One has to go up wooden stairs to the so-called ice cream parlour - its basic layout consists of ordinary tables and chairs - if I am not wrong some years back I can swear there were wooden tables with benches and the low ceiling one can easily touch with their fingers.  Baloch serves variety of ice creams, which appeals mostly to the palate of people from the sub continent (desi style).  Apart from your everyday Mango or Pista kulfi, their well known kulfi is got to be Kulfa - made from milk and sugar cooked slowly until it takes on the texture of a thick caramelised cream, then frozen.  Kulfa is served with sprinkling of pistachio and almonds and it comes in a paper cup rather than in a glass cup.
