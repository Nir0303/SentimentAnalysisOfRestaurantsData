It was excellent.  Got the drinks pretty quick.  Order dinner and an App.  Waitress comes back about 20 minutes later and says she forgot to order App and Entrees will be out soon. Asks \"do you want to skip the App\"? Sure no problem.  1 minute later App shows up and 3 minutes after that Dinner!  She apologizes.  I have Tuscan Chicken, excellent.  Wife has Shrimp San Marino,  she says ok but too much sauce.  We order 2 glasses of wine and they arrive pretty quick.  After dinner its cappuccinos and we share a tiramisu. Almost done with  Cappuccino when dessert shows up.  More Apologies.  No offer of taking the dessert off the bill or an after dinner drink. Tiramisu tastes like a wet sponge.  Awful.

Kudos for trying to modernize but the end result has just further taken it away from what the place once was and still is, an average Italian restaurant.
