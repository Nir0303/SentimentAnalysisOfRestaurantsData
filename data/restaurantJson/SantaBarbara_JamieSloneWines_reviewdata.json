After researching many places for a special group dinner and party on a Saturday night, I realized that my event was beginning to feel like an expensive wedding reception and not a fun and intimate gathering.  Then I stumbled upon the Jamie Slone Wine Tasting room here on TripAdvisor.   Right in the heart of town, it looked like the perfect size for a 20-24 person private party.  More importantly, their wine had great reviews...critical for the wine snobs among us :)  Better yet, it was right next door to one of the best restaurants in town called The Wine Cask.   Kim Slone was wonderful in providing advice for the event prep, receiving deliveries from a local florist and a bakery, letting me in early to decorate, playing great music and recommending the best food selection and setup with The Wine Cask so we could eat and mingle at the same time (rather than being stuck at a big long table like most of the group settings at restaurants in town).   The party was a huge hit.  Kim and a helper kicked it off with a fantastic wine tasting, with individuals later purchasing bottles of their favorites to share or take home.  Honestly, the wine greatly exceeded our expectations...not cheap stuff, so important that we absolutely loved it!   The whole atmosphere was special...definitely made great memories for the birthday girl and all her friends and family.
