I was on a family vacation in California and decided to stop here as it was on Main Street in Huntington Beach (a small beach town that we love). After waiting 10 minutes to even be greeted, we asked for a table of 5.  They were very busy as there were 2 games on that night (NHL Stanley Cup Finals and also the NBA Eastern Conf Finals).  After another 10 minutes, was told that it was 21 and over only and that me and my family had to leave.  I asked why and pointed out that they were a restaurant and it was only 6pm. We were given an excuse that the games were on and then later they were showing a boxing match. Again, I explained that it was only 6pm, but was completely ignored and just told that I had to leave b/c my kids were under 21. \n\nDo not ever visit this restaurant!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-06-11T17:12:08-0400", "location_id": "680855", "id": "131791308", "user": {"username": "Zsulkes", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
