As a lover of books and antiques I've never enjoyed myself more. The moment I walked into Schilb Antiquarian I was greeted by Scott the owner. It was like greeting my twin. His love and excitment for the books and art transferred to the people that walked through his doors. From Childrens books like 1st ed Winnie the Pooh and Peter Pan to 14th Century Incunables and more you will enjoy yourself thoroughly. And it's child friendly. Scott explained to me that he wants people to experience these books and the only way to do that is holding them, feeling them, and enjoying them. So if you love books or even art please stop in and see him and enjoy the conversation.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-09-19T13:25:55-0400", "location_id": "7162160", "id": "229836171", "user": {"username": "trsanders", "user_location": {"name": "Neosho, Missouri", "id": null}}}]}
