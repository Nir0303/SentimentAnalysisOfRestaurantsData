Art for sell will vary so worth a stop if interested in art galleries.\n\nThe type of works for sell include painting, sculpture, photography, ceramics, glass, jewelry and textile art.   The artists range from emerging artists to well accomplished.\n\nWe found metered parking on the street by the gallery.
