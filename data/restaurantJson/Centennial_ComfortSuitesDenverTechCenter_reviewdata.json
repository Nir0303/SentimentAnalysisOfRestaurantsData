I am not new to Hospitality, as I have been in the industry for over a decade and although I am not perfect, I do try to take care of our guests, employees and hotel as best as I possibly can. Also, I never got in your face, as when we spoke, we were several feet away from each other. Even after apologizing to you for standing behind the decision I made, you were insulting, sarcastic and condescending. I am sorry you feel you didn't receive great service while with us. \n\nAlthough I appreciate any and all honest feedback, it is very sad that you felt it necessary for what ever reason to repost the same review over 2 months later.

Breakfast is a great benefit in the mornings bit gotta get up early to catch a bite. Not a problem for me and the wife on this trip. Two things I want the management to know about so they can improve on their customers experience. 1: your beds are hard as stone and if your sheets slip you see the age and the stains on the bed wich almost disgusted my wife into just sleeping on the couch. I know these kinds of beds keep your costs down when you have to replace them but I expected more from comfort suites which I have heard many good things about. 2 : im sorry cleanliness of a hotel is a pet peeve of mine and yea the hotel is clean for the most part but if you look closer hidden things like the mattresses or the random pile of trash in the corner of the elevator that was there for two days or the graffiti scratched into the metal inside the elevator itself makes the place look a bit trashy. Also today as we came back from garden of the gods there was a few bags if trash just sitting out side the elevator. Now, I just took this as someone was cleaning out some cans and was going to take it out no problem not a second thought... Two hours later I came down and its still there.. ok I said something under my breath to my wife because that got on my nerves a little I'm sorry.. we went to get pizza at MOD and drove around Denver for probably another two hours. We come back in and wow... It's still there... I got a little louder and was hoping the front desk attendant heard me about it and went upstairs on my merry way... We watched a three hour movie on HBO which was cool that they had that and went back down to get snacks from the snack bar which is also nice.... Aaaand there it is.. still... This time it's leaking and I literally said as I was coming out of the elevator \" does someone need me to help them take out the freaking trash?\" I said it kinda loud and I think I startled the girl behind the desk but I did not see an effort to apologize for the mess or to try and get someone to take it out to the dumpster.
