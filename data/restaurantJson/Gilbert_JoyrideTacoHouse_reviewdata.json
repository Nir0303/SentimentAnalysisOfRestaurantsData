It was packed and very noisy inside, so we requested to sit outside under a tree, with sails and misters.  Very pleasant!  The patio has a large wall complete with fireplace, which makes it delightfully private, quiet and cozy.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, we were greeted promptly with water and tasty chips and salsa. \n\nI ordered a crispy flour fish taco and a small (half pint) Dos Equis beer. The taco was good (but not crispy) but I expected more for $5.  My husband had a huge machacha beef burro with green chili on the side.  He said it was the best burro he's ever had in Arizona. Sour cream and guacamole was not offered.\n\nI noticed another couple had ordered 2 taco trios and enjoyed them.  I might try that the next time we go.\n\nThere is ample parking in the rear and easy access into the restaurant.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-08-29T16:28:14-0400", "location_id": "4373470", "id": "412504646", "user": {"username": "Gailybird", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
