I has asked for non-smoking rooms so this was totally unexpected.  I couldn't be sure if the smells were from old smoke or old carpet that has never been shampooed.  I convinced my family to try and endure it for just one night since all other nicer hotels were booked up.  When we looked in the bathrooms , the tubs looked as if they were 100 years old with mold and mildew stains around the tub so we could not get showers there.    Before going to bed my granddaughter laid her burger down on the dresser for less than a minute and when she picked it up, a roach had already started to crawl on it so we trashed it.  It was still in the wrapper.  We were told that they served a continental Breakfast from 6:30 - 10:00.  My husband went over around 7:00 Am and found that they had a few muffins and some coffee.    We were very disappointed with this stay.\n\nI complained to the Manager and was told that they would take care of the smells after we check out.  He offered me a 10% discount on only 1 room when he knew that both rooms were horrible.  As this was my first time booking a Days in Property and will likely be my last time..
