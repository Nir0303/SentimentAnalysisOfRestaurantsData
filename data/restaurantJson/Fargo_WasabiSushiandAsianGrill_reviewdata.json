There is a lot of seating and we were seated promptly. Service was fast and responsive during our entire meal experience. We always order hot tea. We were disappointed to get a beat up pot with hot water and presented with two tea bags and coffee cups. Too bad they do not have a decent brewed green tea with Japanese style tea cups. Oh well. We ordered a seaweed salad to share and each ordered one of their speciality rolls. The seaweed salad arrived promptly and was of a decent size to share. It was very nicely dressed and presented. A real hit. Shortly our rolls arrived and they were very large and nicely presented. They were delicious. One test is the rice and this rice was done very well and was fresh.
