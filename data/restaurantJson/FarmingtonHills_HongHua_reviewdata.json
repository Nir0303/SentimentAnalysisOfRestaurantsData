Prepare for some great food. Peking duck is awesome recommend getting that and ordering lettuce wraps with duck stir fry. Soups are excellent especially seafood tofu. Appetizers are great egg rolls, dumplings. Entrees are all excellent seafood and chicken. More upscale pricing entrees $12-$18. Full bar. Business casual dress. Evening dinners a bit fancier. They have great take out as well. You will be hard pressed to find better Chinese in town. On busy nights make a reservation. This is a popular place with local families so it gets crowded. Overall great dining experience.
