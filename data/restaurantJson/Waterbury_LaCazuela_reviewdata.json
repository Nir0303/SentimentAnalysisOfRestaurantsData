The food was incredibly delicious, I ordered the Churrazco and the meat was tender and full of flavor. My daughter who is 6 and VERY picky ordered the 1/2 chicken and she eat the WHOLE thing. My son ordered the cheeseburger because he wanted to be \"safe\" and he loved it and on top of that he eat part of my meal too and my side orders (fried yellow plantains, rice and beans). My mother in law ordered the breaded shrimp and this is the frist time I ever see her eating a whole meal. I am definitely impressed and will come back here very soon....
