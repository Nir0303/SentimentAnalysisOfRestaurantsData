The food, as always was hot and fresh, typical of Popeye's. The service was the worst of any Popeye's I've been. The cashier was rude, loud and condescending. The manger was inattentive and refused to acknowledge any of the problems that were happening in her store and with her employees. I would reiterate what other reviewers have written, a number of questionable people kept ducking in, walking around the dining room, getting sodas and generally disrupting business and guests. Some \"lady's\" appeared to be using the dining room as a \"waiting room\", meeting male associates; I'm trying to be as nice about this as possible. I'm not trying to be insensitive to the seeming overwhelming homeless population in the immediate area of this Popeye's, but if you are traveling and aren't familiar with this town, think carefully about just casually walking into this place with your family. That's not to say that I felt threatened, I just don't want to hang out with that much of the local flavor and to that intensity. I want to experience the local culture but not be thrust into its bowels, which is where, unfortunately this place exists. Every Popeye's I've been to has had great food and this one is no exception, my problem isn't with the quality of food or the cleanliness of the store, it was very clean, my main problem was with the service. My advice to the staff is to tighten up, this is not a game, you're running a business so act like it. Your customers are the reason you're getting a paycheck so respect them.
