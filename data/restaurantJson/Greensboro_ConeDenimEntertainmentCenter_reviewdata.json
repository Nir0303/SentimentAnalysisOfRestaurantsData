I did not realize that General Admission was ALL STANDING. Of course you could rent a small table for $20. Seemed like a safety concern for all standing. You could upgrade to balcony seating up top. The whole event seemed disorganized. Did not realize there was a warm up act. The event was supposed to start at 9. The warm up act started around 8:45 and went til 9:30. Rumors started at 10. We stood outside inline at 7:45 and was really disappointed to have to wait so long. I realized bands start late, but seemed way too long between acts. The warm up act was 1 guy and a guitar!! Not sure why it would take 30 minutes in between. The band was very good and the sound was good, but because we drove over an hour we only stayed about 30 minutes because it was getting late. They should rename the theater to Cone Denim BAR.  I knew there would be alcohol but they need to be more organized about the seating and the check in process. I guess I am one of the few that actually go to a Rock concert to enjoy the music and be entertained without alcohol consumption. I guess that's why they start so late because people drink more as its gets later. Will probably not go back there anytime soon. I will pay extra to have a \"reserved\" seat and go somewhere where safety and security is a priority.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-12T07:29:40-0500", "location_id": "8263411", "id": "436608802", "user": {"username": "Robert T", "user_location": {"name": "Pilot Mountain, North Carolina", "id": "49430"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Great Concert", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60845-d8263411-r421036624-m11068-Cone_Denim_Entertainment_Center-Greensboro_North_Carolina.html#review421036624", "text": "We went to a great concert.

Confusion over how to reserve available tables, call-back from the venue said there would be \"about 30 tables on a first-come basis\", but arriving early, all of the tables were reserved.
