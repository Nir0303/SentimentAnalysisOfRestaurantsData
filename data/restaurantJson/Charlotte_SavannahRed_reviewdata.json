My husband and I went here, because we were too exhausted to leave our hotel for the evening, after a long day. It truly was amazing and I'd even rate it up there with many of the 5 star restaurants we have been to, throughout the east coast. Everything, and I mean everything, that we ordered was cooked superbly. Everything tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly to order (not sitting in a hot well all night waiting to be served).  We were delighted with a small taste of filet, topped with a dill aioli and micro greens, that the chef sent out as a welcome. It totally sold us on ordering the 7oz filet as our entrees. For starters we ordered the crab cake and the seafood starter trio. Being from the Eastern Shore, I am very critical about crab cakes, but this one did not disappoint! Full of lump and hardly any filler. The seafood trio was also to die for! it came with a butternut squash \"cappuccino\", which was basically a butternut squash creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (AHHHMAZING), a perfectly seared diver scallop (AHHHMAZING), and the lobster cobbler (a delicious creamy lobster filling in a puff pasty cup -yes AHHHMAZING). My husband ordered the Cesar salad - it came with shaved Parmesan and a perfectly cooked egg, to break the yolk over the salad.  They have an extensive wine list. We opted for a Malbec, which was also delicious. My husband and I both ordered the filet, medium rare, topped with ribeye butter....you guessed it, AHHHMAZING!! Both steaks had a nice hot crust on the outside and perfectly cooked warm on the inside. As sides we ordered the asparagus, steak mushrooms, goat cheese grits, and mashed potatoes....all were hot, full of flavor, and delicious! To end our meal we had to order the Krispy Kreme bread pudding (topped with a Makers Mark caramel bourbon sauce and creme anglaise).  All of the other reviews on here said it was outstanding, so I had to try it for myself.  No words can describe this sinfully delicious dessert. No words......seriously the best tasting dessert I've had in a very long time.
