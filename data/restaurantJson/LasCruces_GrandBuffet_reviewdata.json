True, the Grand Buffet offers a \"wide selection\" of almost anything that you can think of from frog legs to yakitori chicken, oysters on the half shells to sweet and sour chicken, mac and cheese, pizza, roast beef, stuffed mushrooms, egg rolls, fried rice.... you name it and they probably have it. It is a tribute to fast food and pile your plates so high that you forget that you are really being fed food that is devoid of the respect due the ingredients.
