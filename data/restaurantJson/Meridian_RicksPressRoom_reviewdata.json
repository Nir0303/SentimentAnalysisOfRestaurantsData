It has a garage type front door that can be raised for nice days.  And it was a nice day!  The inside walls are covered in graffiti left by previous customers so the decor is a bit bare.  The only issue I had was the smoke shop next door.  The cigar and cigarette smoke was noticeable when the wind blew in our direction.   Luckily we were sitting with the garage door up.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Orders were taken without delay.  The salmon and potatoes was as good as advertised.  Kudos to the chef.  Another must visit in Idaho.
