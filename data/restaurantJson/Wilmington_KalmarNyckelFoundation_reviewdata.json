It was a very smooth ride even for those who don't like ships. The captains and crew were very knowedgable.  It made for an enjoyable, memorable and educational experience and GREAT pictures as a result. I'd recommend you look into chartering it or at least getting a ticket to ride.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-01-12T10:48:13-0500", "location_id": "318484", "id": "190634592", "user": {"username": "BarristerDE", "user_location": {"name": "Wilmington, Delaware", "id": "34059"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Sailing with the Tall Ships, Downrigging Weekend in Chestertown, MD", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34059-d318484-r184895915-m11068-Kalmar_Nyckel_Foundation-Wilmington_Delaware.html#review184895915", "text": "I was sailing with the tall ships during the Downrigging festival weekend in Chestertown, MD.  And the boat is simply beautiful under full sail.   \n\nI will say they could only raise the sails one day and didn't go out at all the second day due to high wind conditions.  I think some people who's reviews I read here do not understand the difficulties sailing on tall ships.  One just can't raise the sails if the winds are too strong, especially if the area you are sailing in is a confined space like a river or harbor.  This ship has a 12' deep draft and is hard to maneuver even in good conditions,  which limits where and when it can sail.  Each captain has to make that determination based on the weather conditions, or the  area they are sailing in.   \n\nWe had a gorgeous day sailing.  She's a beautiful ship when her sails are up.  She also does a lot  of good helping to educate children and adults to the through the programs they offer.  If your concerned about the condition's for sailing I'd check before purchasing a ticket.  But either way just enjoy helping keep this old vessel's history alive.", "helpful_votes": "5", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-11-16T10:07:34-0500", "location_id": "318484", "id": "184895915", "user": {"username": "Mary C", "user_location": {"name": "Potomac", "id": null}}}]}
