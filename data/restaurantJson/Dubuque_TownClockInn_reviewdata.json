Nothing special about this place.  It feels like a bowling alley and the food is even worse than what you'd get in one. It's food, and it provided sustenance, but that's it. We ordered garlic bread, and it was underwhelming. The frozen garlic bread you can buy in the grocery store is better.  The pizza was nothing to phone home about. They use canned mushrooms, and the crust is strange and lacking flavor. \n\nAnother downside is this place closes at 9:00 on Saturday. Maybe that should have been a sign that it was not impressive.\n\nA highlight....the service was good, but I suspect that's because we were there at 8:15, and they wanted to get us out of there. \n\nMy take away, chain places are better. Stick with dominos or Pizza Hut for better pizza.  If you don't mind either way, you might be fine with this place.

It's a wonderful place to have gatherings when family comes from out of town. It works out really well to put all of our pizzas on one check and have them set up in a buffet style for our family and everyone chips in at the end of the night. Family owned, delicious pizza always!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Irene J, Owner at Town Clock Inn, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to write a review, we try very hard to keep our food consistent by making everything the same way as our family once did.
