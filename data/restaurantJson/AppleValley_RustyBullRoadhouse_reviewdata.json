Three tables were seated after us and their orders were taken before ours was. That's always irritating. $14 for a sandwich, and $8 for a draft beer is overpriced.

She came back with a plan full of fruit, (when little man is happy WE all are happy). I ordered the chicken and waffles, my husband had ribeye. Most delicious and tender. The chicken and waffles comes fried with a half of chicken.  I told Sarah that we were celebrating my husband's birthday, she said, \"don't worry I'm working on something for him.\" It was a waffle covered, with blueberry and chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream..HAPPY BIRTHDAY indeed!!
