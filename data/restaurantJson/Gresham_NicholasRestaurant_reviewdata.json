After 20 minutes we were at the front of the line and the host came up and went to a cheap clip board hanging on the wall (behind customers standing in line) and called the next group to sit.  We had no idea and the placement of the clipboard was such that unless you were a regular...you would never know.  Anyway, the folks in line were very kind and let the lady know we were next because we didn't know to sign in on the wall.  \n\nThe food was the best part.  I ordered a lamb entree and it was delicious.  It was served over a bed of Jasmine rice with saffron.  Very, very delicious.  The lamb was a bit over cooked but I love lamb enough to overlook the slight issue and would still give their food 4-5 stars.\n\nThe service was rushed.  The servers had too many tables and it was rush hour.  It would generally take 5-10 minutes to get something from a server.  Regardless, the servers were kind and were working extremely hard.\n\nI would highly recommend this place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-25T11:36:48-0400", "location_id": "2305822", "id": "367457224", "user": {"username": "RoasterRick", "user_location": {"name": "Portland, Oregon", "id": "1449649"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Food is good but service is terrible!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51893-d2305822-r356193068-m11068-Nicholas_Restaurant-Gresham_Oregon.html#review356193068", "text": "Food is good but service is terrible! Servers not attentive and very slow if you ask for anything. Have been overcharged by mistakes several times. We like the lamb dishes however the lamb used to be better when we first started coming. Service is so bad we've done take-out and then they charge you extra for every little thing which is normally included with the dine-in meal!
