Perfect for weddings or parties.  We held my parents' birthday parties here.  It is reasonably priced, the owners are flexible and easy to deal with, and the place is just beautiful.  They have a small stage that allowed us to have a band.  The second floor is open and allows a great view to the stage and action below.  We would definitely host another event here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-27T13:10:41-0400", "location_id": "474612", "id": "386625076", "user": {"username": "Erin L", "user_location": {"name": "Fall River, Massachusetts", "id": "41564"}}}]}
