One of my friends was served a glass of wine that had gone bad (tasted like vinegar), but within minutes of bringing it to our server's attention, she had a fresh glass of wine.  We had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the atmosphere!\n\nBased on our previous experience, my husband and I recommended SIlver Leaf for a group of our friends this past Sunday evening.  Since we were on the patio,  we had to walk in twice just to request menus.  Once we received our menus, our table noticed that the bottles of wine were an incredible value.  It seemed too good to be true, but our waitress confirmed the pricing, and we decided to split a few  bottles among our group.  It took 20 minutes for our waitress to take our order and another 10 minutes for her to come back outside and tell us she had given us Wednesday menus (when they offer half price bottles), and these bottles were actually twice as much.  Why have separate menus for Wednesday when you can just tell your customers bottles are half price?  Also, why were these menus available to be distributed on a Sunday?  We placed different orders.  It took 15 minutes for us to received our glass of wine, and another 15 minutes for two of the men at our table to be told they were out of the beer they requested.  By this time we'd been there  an hour and half of our group still didn't have drinks.  While many of us would have most likely ordered a second round, our waitress came outside a handful of times to serve the other two tables on the patio but never checked in with us to see if we wanted to order more.  One of our guests did go inside and order directly from the bar to expedite his drink service.  i'm not sure we will be back  (there are too many other wonderful patio bars with quicker service in the downtown area), but I recommend sitting inside so that you can just order directly from the bar!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-02T12:58:35-0400", "location_id": "6941652", "id": "226453621", "user": {"username": "txtraveller82", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Worth, Texas", "id": "55857"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Awesome Place!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55857-d6941652-r221431226-m11068-Silver_Leaf_Cigar_Lounge-Fort_Worth_Texas.html#review221431226", "text": "I've been in Cigar lounges around the world and this place may be the best.
