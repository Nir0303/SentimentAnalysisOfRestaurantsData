Judging by the large lunch crowd, this place must be rather popular amongst the locals.\n\nWith no other multi-meat combos on the menu besides their gigantic family packs, I was left to create one of my own. I ordered a half-pound of chopped pork and a half-rack of pork ribs, with a side of potato salad. As soon as we sat down, I realized my mistake in not requesting sauce on the side for my ribs, so I dashed over to the kitchen and rectified that error. I suppose I could have requested the same for my chopped pork, but I decided to live dangerously today.\n\nThe potato salad was both creamy and delicious, with a good mustardy tang. It didn't have as much crunch as I would have liked from veggie mix-ins, but still very good.\n\nLindsey's big, meaty spare ribs were really juicy and awesomely tender. I found a great flavor on the crust, which thankfully wasn't overpowered by salt. The ribs had only a moderate smokiness, but it was an acceptable level. Only a slight tug was required to separate meat from bone, precisely as it should be.\n\nThe chopped pork was also tender as can be, and the few bites of bark that I found were extra flavorful. I'm not a big sauce fan in general, but Lindsey's vinegary-tomato barbecue sauce was quite tasty. It also added a nice acidity to the dish.\n\nLindsey's might be closer to 3.5 stars, but I was full of Christmas spirit and rounded up.\n\nRead my full review, complete with pictures:\n\nSearch \"The Barbecue Fiend\"", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-31T06:55:48-0500", "location_id": "336123", "id": "336236378", "user": {"username": "TheBarbecueFiend", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Food is all ways delicious", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31818-d336123-r333201322-m11068-Lindsey_s_Hospitality-North_Little_Rock_Arkansas.html#review333201322", "text": "I always enjoy myself when i eat in or carry out at this BBQ RESTAURANT.

The staff were unbelievably friendly and knowledgable. They made us feel like old family friends even though it was our first trip to this restaurant. They catfish was melt in your mouth good and so fresh that there was no \"fishy\" taste. The ribs my daughter ordered melted from the bone with every bite. The BBQ sauce was a well balanced mix of sweet, tart and spicy. The onion rings were a huge hit. Our best review has to be for the fried pies though. They were just as good as my grandma's...and that is saying a lot! All in all I would say this sixty year old family owned restaurant has a winning combination of food and friendliness.
