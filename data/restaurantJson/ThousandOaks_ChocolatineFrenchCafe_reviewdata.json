I noticed previous reviews were at both extremes, so wanted to make up our own minds.  She had the Tomato with Goat Cheese soup and the Salmon Quiche, I had the Zucchini soup and the Ham and Olive Quiche.  The flavor in both soups were excellent, strong tomato flavor with just a hint of goat cheese.  The zucchini soup was surprising in just how flavorful it was, great creamy consistency, nice use of herbs and spices without overpowering the zucchini.  The Quiches were both full of eggs, nice dense body with a flaky crust.  We had a latte with our meal and ordered a cappuccino with an apple and a pear tart.  Great tasty crust on both with nice filling.  The apple tart was French style with a little sour cream in the filling and a brulee top, very pretty and was a fantastic treat.  Sandrine Gaudin, the proprietor with her husband Ludovic, was very gracious, friendly and attentive to her customers.  Everyone was greeted with a lilty \"Bonjour\", menus were delivered promptly with the silverware, as soon as we were ready Sandrine was there to take the order, the food was prepared promptly.  This is while there was nearly a full house.  The whole place is small, so is the kitchen, but it is there.  I asked (because of previous reviews) and Sandrine assured me that she and her husband make everything they serve.  The quality of the food was top notch, the service was great and Sandrine makes you feel like you are in her kitchen at home with a friend, not just another customer, except it is a business and we had to pay. ;-)   My wife and I really enjoyed our visit this morning and will be going back.
