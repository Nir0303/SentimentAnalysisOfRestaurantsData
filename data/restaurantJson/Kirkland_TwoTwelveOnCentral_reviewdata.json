On the food side, let me tell you the chef really knows what he is doing.  The food is very good.  I haven't made it in to try the prime rib but I'd love to.  The menu is generally comfort food and who doesn't love comfort food!\n\nOn the bar side, meh ... and its primarily a bar setting (think high pub tables).  Every time I've gone, the drinks came out v-e-r-y   s-l-o-w-l-y, and they were always under staffed in my opinion.  \n\nI think they do have some seating in the side room but every time I've gone they had something weird going on  (tango dancing, game night)?  I'm sure it's just my timing so don't let this hold you back. I know they regularly have live music and I would love to go sometime and hear the music.\n\nBut I don't go ... I just have generally better restaurants with much easier parking to go to in my rotation of dining out.
