I think I go there too much, but the family is always happy to welcome you.

The Pizza is all that I have eaten, but have seen plenty of others try their other plates (calzones, pastas, eggplant parmesan, etc).  The restaurant is tucked back in a residential area right near highway 36, so if you are in the area or just want the best pizza you have ever had stop by and enjoy the experience.

My wife and I are regulars at Originals and have always enjoyed our meals. We usually have the pizza, but have also shared pasta, Eggplant Parmesan, and other Italian delights. The staff is another reason to dine here. Ralph is a little surly at times, but that just adds to the ambiance. True New York style food and service! If you don't enjoy eating here, you should never bother to visit the Big Apple for pizza.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-04-21T13:13:29-0400", "location_id": "382358", "id": "202131902", "user": {"username": "Shelby L", "user_location": {"name": "Broomfield", "id": null}}}]}
