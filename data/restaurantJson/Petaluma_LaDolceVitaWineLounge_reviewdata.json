It is right across the street from the movie theater. It would be a nice place to go before or after a movie. \nThey have wines from all over the US and Europe. My husband enjoyed a flight of exotic white wines, I enjoyed a fight of Rhone red wines. They have numerous flight options that range in price from $17 to $29 a flight. Each flight includes three wines; each pour is 3 ounces. \nThe food menu is limited. We had a plate of 3 cheeses that was served with bread, crackers, almonds, and apples. The price for this plate is $15.00. We also had their roasted potatoes ($8.00) that were spiced and served with a ketchup-style dipping sauce and a mustard dipping sauce. In addition we enjoyed a pear, caramelized onion, goat cheese, and bacon pizza. The pizza ($13.00) is the size of a large dinner plate. Everything was delicious and substantial. We could not eat it all! We took home half the pizza and half the roasted potatoes. I enjoyed them for my lunch the next day.\nLa Dolce Vita Wine Lounge also shows movies on the wall above the bar. The sound is off; but, the dialogue is screened in print as the movie plays. This way, people can enjoy conversation without having to talk over the sound of the movie; and, people who want to enjoy the movie don't have to strain to hear the dialogue.\nOverall, this is a nice place to go to meet friends, to go as a couple, to go with co-workers to enjoy their happy hour. My husband and I will definitely go back -- in fact, we plan to go back the next time we go see a movie. We will go after the movie to enjoy another wine flight and to try another one of their pizzas.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-07T10:52:01-0400", "location_id": "1184153", "id": "362338708", "user": {"username": "Kathryn H", "user_location": {"name": "Sonoma, California", "id": "33107"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Good wine, friendly and knowledgeable staff", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32874-d1184153-r353392420-m11068-La_Dolce_Vita_Wine_Lounge-Petaluma_Sonoma_County_California.html#review353392420", "text": "We were impressed by our waiters knowledge of the wines that we had questions about.

It is a great place to have a glass of wine to concentrate your mind before a serious movie, and have a light meal, or to have another glass of wine or bubbly to unwind after an action thriller, sob story or musical and top off the evening with a dessert. In keeping with its location in Theatre Square, La Dolce Vita Wine Lounge shows movies on the wall behind the bar from the owner\u2019s collection of classic DVDs, and hosts an Oscar Night. \n\nThe wine menu is organized into groups called flights. Recent titles are Rhone Rangers, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir (more on that in a moment), Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux Varietals and Around the World Reds. Each flight offers a three-ounce taste. If you like something, you can order a glass, half bottle, full bottle served, or a retail bottle to go. The menu gives tasting notes.  For example, Las Mercedes Estate Carmenere 2011 from Maule Valley, Chile: \u201cExpressive and juicy flavors of dense plum, earth, espresso and leather lead to a silky finish.\u201d Note that the wine list changes frequently. As of my recent visit, flights are $15-$19. \n\nThe Pinot Noir flight currently includes Luli 2011 from Santa Lucia Highlands, Folk Machine Westward Expansion 2011 from Potter Valley and Kokumi 2010 from Sonoma Coast.  Notes for the latter are: \u201cIntense fruit aromas of sweet cherry, plum and currants, with notes of violets, herbs de Provence and spice on the velvety finish. Just 120 cases produced.\u201d\n\nOwner Sahar Gharai was inspired to launch this business in 2007 after studying in a wine program in Italy near Florence. There, she visited several wine caf\u00e9s and was charmed by the atmosphere where wine was \u201cthe star.\u201d The outdoor seating area suggests this European sidewalk caf\u00e9 influence. She gave interior design architect Rudabeh Pakravan a general direction\u2014to make it modern and also warm. So instead of industrial chic, it features paneling and a ceiling (no exposed pipes and ducts) and luxurious lounge seating. The result is a place where patrons can feel comfortable enjoying wine and chatting for hours. I particularly like to admire the \u201cwine wall\u201d which houses bottles in mounted racks in the lounge area. The high windows encourage people-watching.\n\nFood Menu: One adventurous night, I ordered the Bacon, Roasted Pear, Caramelized Onion and Goat Cheese Pizza. I say adventurous because it took me a long time to accept putting pineapple on pizza Hawaiian style; forgive me, I was born in New York. The onion flavor did not overpower the rest. The pairing suggestion was for a Pinot Grigio but I enjoyed it with a flight of international reds. I also recommend the Roasted Almonds ($4), the Marinated Olives ($4) and Piatti di Salumi ($11), a platter of sliced Italian Meats, Dubliner Cheese and Olives. For a lingering visit try the cheese plates which offer three selections for $12 or seven for $25. Choices include Mt Tam Cow Cheese from Cowgirl Creamery, and others from the U.S., Spain and Ireland, all served with French bread, apples and almonds.\n\nDesserts include Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 Cake, Limoncello Cake, Cheesecake and Tiramisu ($7-8). My favorite perk-up to finish a meal is the Caffe Glace: Vanilla Bean Gelato topped with coffee and whipped cream. \n\nI have visited about a dozen times over the last few years, including two Oscar nights which have the awards showing on the screen behind the bar, a red carpet, trivia contests, and awards for customers, who are encouraged to dress up or in character. Some members of the \u201cPetaluminati\u201d watch the Academy Awards on the big screen theater and then join the \u201cafter-party\u201d at LDV, or just stay there for the whole show.\n\nThis hospitality experience has a lot going for it: location, concept, d\u00e9cor, product, and service. It also has two X factors: atmosphere and charm. The owner and staff enjoy answering questions and will try to determine your taste to recommend something you might like. They enjoy sharing their enthusiasm. I asked Sahar what are the wines to watch in the near future. She is excited about the California Pinot Noir 2012 vintage, especially Napa and Sonoma, and wines from Chile.\n\nLDV also provides one detail very well. When you get your flight, each glass is labeled. In a convivial conversation it is easy to forget which wine is which, so the label is a simple but thoughtful gesture.\n\nGreat place for a first date or an anniversary. Romantic, urbane, joyous. There is a loyal group of regulars who welcome newcomers. Like other newer wine lounges, La Dolce Vita encourages exploration and celebration to overcome the reputation wine has that intimidates those new to wine tasting. You don\u2019t have to be an expert, just be curious, and even the experts like to be surprised by a new region or producer. My suggestion: offer a flight of wines from New Zealand, where The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings were filmed, and call it the Frodo Flight!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-01-30T06:49:55-0500", "location_id": "1184153", "id": "151020460", "user": {"username": "CJ N", "user_location": {"name": "Petaluma", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Incredible atmosphere, great food and wine, wonderful service!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32874-d1184153-r142777856-m11068-La_Dolce_Vita_Wine_Lounge-Petaluma_Sonoma_County_California.html#review142777856", "text": "We stopped in for a tasting and thoroughly enjoyed the food and wine!

She introduced us to her favorite place to eat in Petaluma and her taste was right on. Tucked back in a little square we probably would never have found it on our own. Upon entering we were greeted  and invited to choose any seat we wanted. The seating ranged from intimate small tables w/high bar stools to seats at the wooden counter that faced the square, also small tables for 4s that could be arranged for larger groups. There were comfy sofas for groups to gather and sip wine and an outdoor patio to dine on warmer days.\n\nEnough about the casual yet elegant atmosphere. There was a lengthy wine menu of wines by the glass, half liter or bottle to choose from. Wines from Sonoma and Napa, of course, but an equal selection from regions worldwide, The staff was very knowledgeable and happy to help you pick one that would suit your palette.\n\nBut ahhh, the food. La Dolce Vita is a small family business, with owner Sahar providing the wine knowledge and mom and dad cooking in the kitchen. Her mom makes a variety of unique hummus and tasty pita chips to accompany them. They offer fabulous bruschettas, including one topped with mushrooms that is divine.  The flatbread  pizzas they serve are also fabulous and come in interesting combinations. Don't miss the carmelized onion with pear and pancetta. It's to die for. A variety of fresh local salads  round out the meal. Don't forget to try desserts; they too are delicious.\n\nThis is one of my favorite places to eat in Petaluma and I can't wait to return on my next trip.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2009-11-03T07:35:15-0500", "location_id": "1184153", "id": "48420535", "user": {"username": "cjvSeattle_WA", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, WA", "id": null}}}]}
