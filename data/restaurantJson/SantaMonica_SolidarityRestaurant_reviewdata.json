This was a great choice. We had chicken soups. They were what we really wanted, clear, brothy and tasty. My wife had a tripe soup. It tasted just as we are used to. As a main course we ordered strogonof and bigos. Both very nice dishes however, we'd welcome a little bigger portions. I don't remember last time I left a restaurant half hungry after $120 check. Overall, tasty dishes, fantastic combinations of spices, but very small and pricey.

Formerly, the ever popular Warszawa, has been renamed and rebranded Solidarity with the owner's daughter in charge.  What hasn't changed, thank goodness, is the authentic Polish cuisine that will melt your heart and make you want to travel to Eastern Europe.  Set in a old house, it makes you feel like you have been invited over for home cooked Polish food by your favorite friends.  We started off with ice-cold martinis (oh so good, the Bison grass polish vodka) and could have just stayed with the pierogis all night long.  Instead, I had the huge house salad with grilled salmon (fantastic) and my husband had the golaki (stuffed cabbage), pricey but good.  For domestic and international travelers this is a restaurant that is memorable and close to the Santa Monica Pier and beach.
