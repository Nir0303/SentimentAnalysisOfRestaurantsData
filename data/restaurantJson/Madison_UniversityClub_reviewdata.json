My wife and I are auditing a course this semester and sometimes go to lunch before class. After the waiting in line counter service restaurants where you needed to make a quick decision and then find a place to sit, we decided to try something different. When we entered the gorgeous building and saw the white table cloths, we were expecting to pay much more than we had for fast food. To our surprise we paid about $25 with tip compared to the $16 for two we had been paying. The menu is quite diverse and they have daily specials. I had their grilled fish sandwich with french fries and coleslaw for $10.  Besides very good food, the atmosphere is relaxing. The wait staff tries very hard to please.
