Came back Oct 21st and it was a big disappointment.\n\nThe first time I went I had the huevos verde with carnitas. It was delicious. I've dreamt about it since. Perfect amount of meat to sauce. The masa cake was nice and tender and the verde sauce was amazing. Second time I went my wife had it with chorizo and it wasn't even close to the same thing. The biggest let down on that part was that she got maybe 1 ounce of burnt chorizo.  The masa cake was burnt and hard to get through. The second time around I got the huevos diablos. It was ok. Not very flavorful though. The masa cake was burnt pretty bad too. Portions for both plates were smaller. The presentation of the dishes were a little lacking to compared to the first visit. \nThere were two different chefs working on each visit and the first one (a bald gentlemen) seemed to be more passionate about his work. \nOverall I really like Tres Mil border cafe but I will be selective on when I go there. I would rate it a 5 if it were based off my first trip and a 1 if it were off of my second trip so a 3 it is. I will return, hopefully I can relive my first breakfast experience there.
