However:\n\nThey shot themselves in the foot by always charging a cover when their other bar, Aces, which is next door, is free to get in. It set a bad precedent and after people realized it often wasn't worth it (always less crowded than next door) they stopped being willing to pay to get inside. Also, not everyone likes country, or is willing to pay a premium to listen to it.\n\nSo, they started branching out with karoke and having rock bands come, which I think disheartened avid country fans. I know Spurs co-sponsors street dances in the summer which draw a huge crowd. I just think they fell short somewhere of making this venue really fun. I still like the space and the idea, but it's tough to make it a destination for a night out when the party always seems to be somewhere else.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-18T11:46:57-0400", "location_id": "5083774", "id": "374252497", "user": {"username": "gucci123_13", "user_location": {"name": "Duluth, Minnesota", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "I don't really get it", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43018-d5083774-r232239403-m11068-Spurs_On_First_Street-Duluth_Minnesota.html#review232239403", "text": "Weird place...seems to be struggling with an identity crisis.
