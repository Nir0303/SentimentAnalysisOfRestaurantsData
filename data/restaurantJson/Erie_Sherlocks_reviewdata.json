During Roar on the Shore there is seating to accommodate most.  We were fortunate enough to find the stairway that leads to their upstairs small balcony.  Since the band's stage is right down the street, we were able to watch the show with ease towering above the horde of spectators below.  Find this balcony quick since it has a limited capacity.  The bartender also frequents the balcony which saved us from walking up and down the stairs to the bar.  A restroom is right down the hall and very convenient.  Don't miss this during any visit there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-14T10:33:45-0400", "location_id": "4983845", "id": "418531672", "user": {"username": "slbhanna", "user_location": {"name": "Pittsburgh, PA", "id": null}}}]}
