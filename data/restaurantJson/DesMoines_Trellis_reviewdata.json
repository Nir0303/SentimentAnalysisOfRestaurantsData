You can order a full lunch option or two of any option. They have soups, salads, pastas and sandwiches. The items tend to be on the vegetarian, Mediterranean or more unusual side of luncheon options. They often have curry, spicy or gluten-free or vegan options.  You can have a sample of soup before you order. They have wines and beers to try. The view is of the gardens and on nice days, you can eat outside. It is a place you can come for lunch at 11 am and stay until 2 pm. It is ideal for groups, friends meeting for lunch or more relaxed business meetings. You do not have to pay for admissions; just tell the desk at the shop that you are going to Trellis and enter through the right hand door to go to the Trellis door rather than go through the Botanical dome. They are  not open on Mondays! I took my mother on a recent Tuesday and we tried the soups and the tomato salad to start. I had the grilled fruit and brie flatbread. She had the turkey sandwich. She could only eat one half. We each liked the potato and beet soup. The salad had too many pine nuts on it for me, but the tomatoes were nice. I loved the flatbread, but it was messy.
