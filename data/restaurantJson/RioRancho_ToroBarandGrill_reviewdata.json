After a long week (or long day) at work, this is a perfect place to unwind and have a conversation over drinks or dinner.  There is a small outdoor patio, but it has been too windy lately to enjoy that.  They also offer live music some evenings, but usually at 8 or 9 pm.

The bartender had one customer and was just standing there talking. She talked for a few minutes, then finally poured my husband a beer as we watched in amazement. \nThe chicken wings were a joke. Luke warm, five little half wings (the small part) drenched in rancid vinegar and honey for $7. I wanted to complain, but our waitress was gone. In fact, all the servers were gone. We sat there waiting for about 20 minutes and didn't see a soul. Our drinks were empty. Finally, a different waitress came out with some food. The kids and I had burgers and my husband had a steak. All the food tasted like pre-cooked frozen food that you just pop into the microwave--about one step up from a frozen dinner. I would not be surprised if the kitchen didn't even have a stove.\n\nI wish I could say that this was just a bad day for the restaurant, every restaurant has them.
