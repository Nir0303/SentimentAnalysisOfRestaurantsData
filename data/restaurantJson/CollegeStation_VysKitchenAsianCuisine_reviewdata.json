You can tell the ownership and staff care about the place. The waitstaff was VERY nice. From the moment we walked in the door, they were nice to us and very attentive. The only issue that we had was with the food itself. It was very bland and lacked flavor. We had egg rolls as an appetizer and they were good, but plain. I had sweet and sour chicken for my entree. The sauce was an orange color. It looked a bit strange. It wasn't horrible tasting, but it just didn't have any flavor. The rest of our meals were just lacking in flavor too. Unfortunately every one of us ended up sick to our stomachs. I gave it 2 stars because of the cleanliness and wonderful staff. We really wish the food was better. Probably will not come back.

Vy's was close to our hotel so we chose this place.\n\nO.k, so it is super bowl Sunday, we pull up, no cars at all in the lot, but the open sign in on.  They were open, score one for the home team, or so we thought.\n\nSeated promptly, 5 in our party, they brought out 4 waters, missed on that.  We got our menus, nice selection.   The waiter was really prompt off the bat, but it went downhill from there.  After about 10 minutes he came back, now remember at this time, there was 1 table with customers, ours.  Anyway, we order, all is well, or so we thought.  About 5 minutes later he comes back to tell us that the beef dinner my wife ordered could not be done as they were out, so order something else.  Our son and myself had ordered the beef with asparagus, he said no problem they had that, just not the grilled sliced beef.   Anyway, he comes back directly, oh, no sliced beef at all, so you need to order something different, so a complete miss on 3 of 5 orders off the bat.   Here is a hint for the owner.   Stock your menu items or get them off the menu, no sliced beef, no tempura shrimp, ......   should have left then.\n\nDuring the time the place is starting to fill up.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later we get 2 of 3 appetizers, the final one came after dinner got there.  Dinner service was a huge joke, 1 meal, the every 5 minutes the next would arrive.  Basically the service was perhaps the worst we had ever experienced. \n\nThe dinners were overall very bland and tasteless, just a horrible experience.  You actually could probably get tastier food and better service at the corner gas station.\n\nSo with all that in mind I would recommend finding another Asian cuisine to hit up, or find a taco bell so you won't be disappointed. \n\nNow onto the overall experience.  The decor and design of the place is a tad schizophrenic, kind of like an interior designer walked in and exploded.  Very crazy. \n\nThe food is presented looking very nice (just lacking taste, seasoning is your friend).  The portions are huge.  \n\nIf they could find a way to actually have service, and get some taste to the food this would be a great start.  Then hire someone with a vision on how an asian restaurant should look, you might have a great place.  The major issue though overall is the service sucks.  If I could give it a negative I would.

There is a host table, but no sign indicating whether you should wait to be seated, or seat yourself.  No staff were around.  After about a 5 minute wait alone, someone emerged and said I could sit where I pleased.  Refills of drinks were slow.  I even had to slurp on my straw and shake the ice in my cup (to no avail) to get the attention of someone for a refill.\n\nBland:  The egg drop soup was completely tasteless.  I had to add quite a bit of salt to get any taste, and I rarely add salt to any dish.\n\nStrange:  The entr\u00e9e had a strange flavor.  Afterwards I thought about how to describe it.  The best way to describe it was old coconut fried shrimp with the coconut dusted off, and mixed with old, recycled walnut-shrimp sauce.  It wasn't disgusting, but it was very palatable either.  The rice had a decent flavor, but the texture and consistency of it was less than desirable.\n\nOverpriced.  Egg drop soup (small) was almost $4.  To be fair, it was pretty large.  Definitely not a cup - about the size of most soup bowls at other restaurants.  The entrees do not come with rice.  I asked for fried rice, assuming that was included in the entr\u00e9e.  It is not.  All told, for the entr\u00e9e, rice, soup (and water) cost just shy of $15.  For that amount I could have gotten a much more palatable meal elsewhere.  I should have just gone to Panda Express and paid less for better tasting food.\n\nI won't be going back.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-07-30T18:28:40-0400", "location_id": "3983238", "id": "170063427", "user": {"username": "Gideon_Krasmanic", "user_location": {"name": "San Antonio, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-07", "title": "Good Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55649-d3983238-r169336298-m11068-Vy_s_Kitchen_Asian_Cuisine-College_Station_Texas.html#review169336298", "text": "I look forward to trying more dishes here.
