Concept is very good but concept is only as good as the people implementing.  When we received our food (I ordered two classic tacos with rice & beans) my shells were cold with a touch of warmth.  There wasn't much steak in tacos and with the cool shells not a very good first impression for a new customer.  The black beans were very good although small portion.  Rice was ok.  I think had the taco been better I would have liked the overall taste.  As it is there are too many places to eat and not enough time so I would not return here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-07T13:13:04-0400", "location_id": "2622897", "id": "286504994", "user": {"username": "debkayscu", "user_location": {"name": "garland, tx", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Beyond reproach", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32605-d2622897-r248150578-m11068-Rubio_s-Lakewood_California.html#review248150578", "text": "I normally do not write reviews of any fast food restaurant but the nice service at this one deserves to be praised.
