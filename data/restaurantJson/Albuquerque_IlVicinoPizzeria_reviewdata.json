This establishment has been around a while in Nob Hill and has undergone at least one renovation over the years.\n\nIt has also been uneven in the quality of the food and at times I would NOT rank it the highest in regard to pizza, that honor remains with Amore.\n\nIf not pizza than the lacto choice for me is the LASAGNA GIARDINIERE. When heated properly, this is a piece from a larger precooked tray that is refrigerated, its pretty good and tasty. A pleasant blend with the addition of pesto on top and fresh ground Parmesan cheese grated for you by the wait person.\n\nI had dinner with three friends on this occasion and we always come away with a couple of gripes that persist even though we know we are not the only ones with the same thoughts.\n\nBecause everything is somewhat prepped and in a fixed state it is difficult to have an alteration of an item. Example the CALZONE VEGETARIANO which is made with goat cheese. A number of occasions I have had to pass on this selection because they could not or would not substitute mozzarella for the goat cheese. One time I was told they don't have mozzarella ... what are you kidding? I personally dislike goat cheese for a number of reasons. Others in my dining group have had similar problems with other selections.\n\nIts a nice touch to have bread, which is pretty good, with olive oil. The only problem the oil oil is not plain. The only choice is a \"spiced\" oil that is rather hot. The portion of bread that is provided is \"skimpy\" at best. At a minimum it would be nice to have enough to sop up the sauce remainders or dressing remainders if you have a side salad.\n\nSalad is somewhat limited as a vegetarian choice, at times it seems impossible to get an order of something other than the house salad without meat or fish, or dressing without anchovies. (The original Caesar Cardini  Salad dressing was made without anchovies ... ask me how I know.)\n\nThe soup selection remains a vegetarian mystery. I have yet to get a consist answer about the contents, so I opt out.\n\nAll and all it is a reasonable choice for a mixed group of food ethics, not perfect though.\n\nThe place can be noisy and crowed at times.

For those who do not know, you will see a huge menu right when entering, and then you proceed to the register to order. After you order and pay they will give you a number so your server can find you at whatever table you choose, either inside or in the nice cozy patio outside. You are not required to pay the tip then, unless you want to. My absolute favorite pizza is the Testarossa, you cannot go wrong with its Greek flavors. The waiters have always been excellent at this location and if you bring kids they will give them a piece of raw pizza dough for them to play and entertain themselves. Pizzas do not take to  long to be ready. One more thing, the pizzas are personal size, you may share one with someone but will be left hungry if you have a good appetite, the kids' pizzas are generously portioned.
