The escape room was so engaging and kept everyone on their toes as we searched for and matched up clues and puzzles that we found. I loved seeing the whole family (3 generations) working together to escape. We didn't escape, but we had such a fun time! I highly recommend Escapeology for social events, a night out with friends, birthday parties, and corporate events. I'm actually trying to see if I can get a team outing at work together to do this.
