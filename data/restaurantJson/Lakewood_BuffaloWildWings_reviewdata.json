In my adult life, I've stiffed a server three times - today was the third. If I'm going to say something bad about a place, I usually sleep on it, but the whole experience was so bizarre it sent me into in existential contemplation about the nature of the following query: which was worse, the service or the food? The answer: yes. \n\nI arrived at high noon, and although I've eaten in maybe 50 BWWs over the years, this was the first that didn't have a greeter, and it had an empty barroom even though it's in an NFL town with a football game tonight. I should have left right then, but I stayed. The bartender was covering the bar floor as well and I asked where I could sit and she said anywhere I wanted. She had four customers at the bar, and 2-3 tables. After about 5 minutes give/take, she brought me a menu and asked for my drink order. I told her I wanted tea and an order of onion rings to start. \n\nThe rings took awhile to get out and they were lukewarm - no silverware, no napkins. In fairness, she realized a few minutes later that I had no silverware or napkins and brought me two glorious napkins, no silverware. Whatever, I was starving, so I ate them and said nothing, and my tea was now empty. My co-worker joined me around 12:15 and he sat until nearly 12:25 before she came over. He ordered wings, and I ordered a burger/fries side of mayo, and I asked for a fresh tea - she brought me a fresh glass of tea and left the dirty one on the table. To say she was mailing it in would be an insult to the US Postal Service - I kept waiting for Gordon Ramsey to come out of the kitchen and start screaming at her, just to see if it might liven her up a bit. I've never seen a human being wait tables as though they'd broken parole and this was their court-ordered punishment.  \n\nAnyway: For the next half hour, we waited. \n\nNeither of us were in a hurry and we talked business. After about 20 minutes, though, we both noticed that it sure was taking a long time to get our food, especially in a restaurant that was dead. \"She's probably out back smoking a cigarette and texting,\" my co-worker said, and it was clear the server had disappeared. We both realized we were suddenly trapped in the middle of a really bad ripoff of a Samuel Beckett play.\n\nIt was somewhere around 1 when our \"food\" came out. His wings were cold but he was hungry so he ate them. \"Your burger sure looks dry,\" he said, and as I applied mayo to the cold, stale bun, I put my finger on the patty and realized it was somewhere between room temperature and what we in the civilized world would call \"luke warm.\" I took one bite and spit it out in my napkin. The server returned with silverware and I told her she could take my cold burger. She didn't ask what was wrong, she didn't apologize, nothing. She had all the curiosity of a burro who doesn't feel like moving. \n\nShe took the burger back to the kitchen and whence cometh a manager - unsure if it was the kitchen manager, the manager on duty or the store manager or just someone pretending to work at this location, as she didn't bother to introduce herself. She asked why I sent the burger back and I said \"It's old and stale and has obviously been sitting under a heatlamp for some time.\" She didn't apologize, but she did make sure and say \"It wasn't sittting there that long\" at which point I cut her off and told her I wasn't here to debate the matter. She asked if I wanted another burger and I said no. She still didn't apologize for the crap product that her crap kitchen produced. Miraculously, they took the burger off my ticket. \n\nWe hung out for awhile because our server wouldn't bring the check over. Even after we asked for the check, she made sure and tended to every one of her bar customers - all 5 of them at this point - before finally printing our checks. My friend tipped a dollar, and I tipped a big fat donut. \n\nI'm Tweeting this review to Buffalo Wild Wings because I want them to read through all the reviews I've done here and notice how few of them have anything bad to say about the places I eat and sleep. I'm a happy, positive traveler and if I can convince BWW to either close that facility or clean house, then I consider it a favor to an otherwise good company and all the people who wonder whether or not they should eat at this depressing landfill. \n\nIn closing: two years ago in Utila Bay, Honduras, I ate a bad bowl of stew, vomited for a couple of hours and slept in a cold sweat for about six more. I was on an island in a third-world country with limited medical care. I would rather eat at that place again than this Buffalo Wild Wings. \n\nFIN", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-10-23T14:47:13-0400", "location_id": "622923", "id": "235952392", "user": {"username": "Coolihoma", "user_location": {"name": "Stillwater, Oklahoma", "id": "51667"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Not going again", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33514-d622923-r222948587-m11068-Buffalo_Wild_Wings-Lakewood_Colorado.html#review222948587", "text": "I had stopped going here months ago because the quality of the food got bad, especially the wings.

It wasn't until I noticed families going in that convinced me to try it.\nWhen we walked in it felt very comfortable. Sometimes having kids come along to what you think is an adult only atmosphere can feel a little uncomfortable but this wasn't the case. Sure, there were plenty of adults watching games play out on tv but there were many families there too. Some of the families with the parents watching the game and kids playing the portable touch screen games. Yes, they not only have arcade machines but also portable touch screen game tablets. The tablets are big like a small flat screen television that stands. You need a credit card to add funds and although most of the games are more for adults to play together while having a few drinks and wings there are a few kid games. \nIt was clean and a good kind of noisy. The kind of noise you expect to hear at a large family gathering where everyone is having a great time. This was perfect for the kids who can almost always have their parents saying \"shhh\" when having dinner but also great fir the adults having a conversation and not feel that everyone is listening in.\nThe restrooms were very clean and staff very nice even if they weren't serving you.\nI loved this place! The prices are what you would expect to spend going out to eat. \nBottom line this is a place where everyone can have a great time from the single people to families.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2012-11-05T05:57:20-0500", "location_id": "622923", "id": "144581353", "user": {"username": "mommyDM", "user_location": {"name": "Denver, Colorado", "id": "33388"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "Great Service and great food.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33514-d622923-r141536535-m11068-Buffalo_Wild_Wings-Lakewood_Colorado.html#review141536535", "text": "I went here with a friend for lunch and the flat bread pizza was great.
