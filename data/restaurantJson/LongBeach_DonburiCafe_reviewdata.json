There are about 18 to choose from combining fish, meat, vegetables, and sauces - that are simmered - and served over white rice.\n\nI believe it to be a health-conscious, tasty eatery.\nEvery item I continually try, is good. Every item is made on the premises. It's truly a \"Mom & Pop\" business so be excited and tolerant of any wait. Co-owners Steve & Amy, and their extra hands, really do a wonderful job, wait-time, time-after-time, considering they opened in 2015.\n\nOriginally, I ventured out, tiring of my old ways - trying new things, foods, and destinations. I chose #10 - Oyako Don, a delicious chicken & egg ( think scramble ) with sauce on-the-side. I wasn't surprised to have learned, I ordered the most generic bowl throughout all of Japan. \n\nThe portion was filling - it is accompanied with a green salad - miso soup (with just the right amount of saltiness). And for a small fee, a side of radish kimchi - or of jalape\u00f1os or of cabbage. Overall, the value is outstanding, and the food is fresh, flavorful, and cooked-to-order. \n\nThe culinary skill of combining Japanese/Korean spices and cooking-styles is masterful without being overpowered by sauce. And seeing kitchen and dining areas as beautiful - with clean-gleam wood and stone finishes - heightens a visit here.\n\nDonburi is a welcome new addition for dining in the LBC, for lunch and early dinners - with Sake & Beer available for purchase,  while dining indoors only.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-25T17:47:01-0400", "location_id": "8492228", "id": "358589262", "user": {"username": "TGDino", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Fresh and tasty ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32648-d8492228-r356605966-m11068-Donburi_Cafe-Long_Beach_California.html#review356605966", "text": "Had a really good lunch at this small Japanese place just off Pine.
