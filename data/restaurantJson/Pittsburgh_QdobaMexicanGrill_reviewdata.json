Some weeks I'd go 3 or 4 times for lunch.  \n\nDowntown it's not all that uncommon to learn your customer's names, as they become regulars, but you know it's next level when you start knowing the employees names  - when they don't have name tags.  \n\nJoy and the team truly take care of business, even when she's having a horrible day and I talk to her, she's still just as friendly, as is the rest of the staff.  (If she reads this she'll remember me and my blue Nike hat.)  \n\nProbably only about 1% of the time was my order ever wrong and I was too polite to say anything.  There have been days where I forgot my wallet, they knew I'd be back the next day to pay - they're good reasonable people.  \n\nEmployees make eye contact and even though they've dealt with 200 other people before you, you feel like they've been waiting to see you and help you, personally.\n\nFood is done correctly, ripped burritos are redone without asking.  Soft taco shells are steamed lightly and guacamole is added FIRST to your taco, rather than last - because they know that when you put in on top of the lettuce, it gets everywhere.  They truly understand what they're doing and how they're doing it.  I've asked for guac before that was not from the greatest avocados and they refused to give it to me - because they knew it was sub par that day.  \n\nNever ever had cause to return food, no hairs, no tomato cores, no chicken bones - attention to detail.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-10-03T16:13:14-0400", "location_id": "4832116", "id": "179645333", "user": {"username": "jason a", "user_location": {"name": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "id": "53449"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "Yummy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g53449-d4832116-r177727724-m11068-Qdoba_Mexican_Grill-Pittsburgh_Pennsylvania.html#review177727724", "text": "The food is yummy.
