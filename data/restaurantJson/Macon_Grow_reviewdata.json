Our office often gets lunch brought in and we try to change up our usual selections.  We all love Grow for their fresh offerings that concentrate on local, organic veggies, fruits, meats and eggs.  Since the restaurant is farm-to-table, their menu changes very often.  You can always find a most recent menu listing on their Facebook page.  Some of the standards they always have include pimento cheese, chicken salad, and eggplant parmesan.  The eggplant parmesan is delicious and served in half an eggplant; it is so light and not heavy tasting at all. And the eggplant never tastes bitter.  My most recent choice was their grilled peach salad with grilled chicken!  OMG! It was one of the best salads I have ever eaten! It was loaded with fresh, local mixed Spring greens, a nut and seed mix, raisins, red onion, feta cheese, grilled chicken chunks and juicy, sweet grilled peach halves-all locally sourced!  I got the salad with a Vidalia onion vinaigrette that was perfect with the sweetness of the peaches, tanginess of the feta cheese and the sharpness of the red onion.  The only drawback to the salad, in my opinion, was a hunk of cold bread on the side.  It wasn't good and the salad didn't need it.  \nOther meals we have had there include a chicken teriyaki wok with smashed sweet potatoes that one of co-workers said was yummy.  And another one of my co-workers absolutely loves their rutabaga fries.  They've also offered a strawberry salad that you can get with grilled chicken and it is very good.  If they have egg salad on the menu made with fresh farm eggs, definitely try that!  You can really taste the difference between egg salad made with local eggs versus store-bought ones.  \nWe look forward to getting lunches from Grow, love the changing menu to reflect the seasons and always feel healthier knowing we are eating food fresh from the farm.  And we love supporting our hometown Macon businesses!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-08-16T12:15:44-0400", "location_id": "7345634", "id": "406295529", "user": {"username": "PWMonroe", "user_location": {"name": "Macon, Georgia", "id": "60920"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "The food is so good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60920-d7345634-r385069685-m11068-Grow-Macon_Georgia.html#review385069685", "text": "The food is so good.

An excellent concept that I've had nowhere else/ goat cheese is rolled in a variety of coatings (nuts, honey, bacon, cranberries, fresh herbs) and served as a six-count appetizer.  Certainly give this a try.  \n\nFor lunch I had Eggplant Parmesan.   This is not your normal eggplant which is traditionally heavily breaded and fried.  This dish consists of sliced fresh eggplant covered in marinara and cheese and then baked.  Don't expect deep fried with this.  Do expect a refreshing new twist on an old classic.  \n\nThe service at Grow was very attentive but not intrusive.  The owner and chef came by at different times just to check to see that everything was going well.  I did speak with the owner and inquired about any gluten free offerings and she assured me that there are several dishes on the menu that are gluten free and she can alter others to meet the dietary need.  Overall, everyone was pleasant, enthusiastic and accommodating.  \n\nGiven that the location of Grow is less than a mile off the interstate, I'd recommend that anyone travelling through Macon make the quick stop off the interstate to stop in.  This restaurant is truly a find and should not be missed.\n\nOne note worth mentioning - as the food is obtained locally, I am told that the menu can change from week to week depending on what's available.   The day I was in, there was a variety of offerings ranging from grilled chicken, salads, soup, sandwiches, chicken stir-fry, their signature sloppy joe and a classic hamburger steak.  I believe that you should be able to check their Facebook page for the current menu.  Regardless of what's on the menu today, based on my meal, I can only imagine that it will be fantastic!\n\nFinally, although, I turned it down, there was salted caramel cake for dessert.
