This hotel has none of these. The room is moldy, keeping myself and son awake with asthma, it is hot and stuffy (A/C does not work, they are in the \"warming\" season right now), there is bloody gauze under one bed, there was a spider in the bathroom, it probably came out of the hole in the wall by the shower head and they just put caulk over existing mold. There is an ambulance repeatedly passing by and a fight just broke out. We are in a premium room where there are supposed to be free \"vending\" machines for snacks and beverages, I was rudely told with inconsistent dates that they were taken out (they're still on the website) and replaced with the snacks in the room, which consists of 1 each of 4 different sodas, a water and a juice and a basket with a few snacks, again 1 each. I stress the 1 each because the reservation asks how many children and I honestly stated 4. As any parent knows, having 1 type of something and 4 little children after a long car ride is like throwing 1 fish into a pool filled with sharks...there will be blood. When I brought up Hilton's motto of, \"We'll make it right,\" the woman claiming to be the manager instantly stated, \"We are independently owned and operated,\" with both hands up in the air.

He recommends opening the balcony door and the room front door and sleeping with the room door propped open.  I tell the engineer there is no way.  I did sleep with the window open but readers should know there is a hospital nearby and the sirens from the ambulances were disturbing.\nBreakfest is the usual Embassy Suites and was good.
