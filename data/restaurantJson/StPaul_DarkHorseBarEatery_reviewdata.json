Nice patio, but the chairs are uncomfortable. Beer is expensive. My daughter had a glass of craft beer that was 14.00!  Food is an odd assortment. Although my cheeseburger tasted alright it basically fell apart on the plate. The bacon on it had more fat then meet. Husband had the weirdest hotdog ever-had fried green beans on it. He was not a fan. My daughter had a salad that was small and expensive. Although we did not not have any the pizza coming out and delivered to the table next to us looked good at least.
