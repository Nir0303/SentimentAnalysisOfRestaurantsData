That's right, just she and I, lunch together, never having met before.  We both came 4 hours from opposite directions and met in the middle.  She did the choosing -Jensen's Cafe - based upon an Internet search.  SMART GIRL.  FABULOUS RESTAURANT.  I can't say enough positive things about this place.  The service is matchless; the food is light, fresh, unique and delish; the facility has plenty of natural light and a high ceiling but it didn't feel oppressive (you know how sometimes the sun can bear down through a restaurant window and make the whole meal uncomfortable...). I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict and was surprised when it arrived on little pancakes and not English muffins (apparently I didn't read the menu well as I was concentrating more on \"the girl\").  It was scrumptious. I savored every bite.  The pancake was not sweet or distracting, only delicate and quite a special complement to the dish.  And then she and I shared Swedish Pancakes with Strawberries and Cream for dessert.  Let me say this, from a girl who grew up making Swedish pancakes with her Swedish grandmama, these are the real deal.  I just about cried; yes, just like grandma and I used to make, including the larger size, light brown with bubbly marks AND the crispy edges.  Unbelievable.  I thought, \"this deserves a cup of tea alongside,\" so I ordered Earl Gray.  The waiter brought a clean, shining, quality mug and saucer, teapot with extra water and a very special tea bag like I had never seen before.  It didn't have a string and tag; it was the normal width but twice as long. So easy to handle!  Is this a \"cafe\"? Really?  Don't let that word communicate anything but refreshing goodness to you.  I wouldn't call it a \"cafe\".  Pretty furniture, pretty environs, pretty food, not \"foo-foo,\" just pretty.  Everything about this restaurant is a pleasant experience. And A+ for service.
