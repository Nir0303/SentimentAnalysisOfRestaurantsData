Even inside the restaurant, there were napkins tacked onto the wall with many compliments on food and service.  The food selection was alright.  I figured the portions would be big, so to save time and dishes, I ordered our food in to go boxes, so we could just leave with our leftovers.  As soon as the lady saw us looking through the bags, she yelled out for us to stop.  She said we ordered our food to go, so we couldn't eat in the restaurant, and we had to leave!  I have NEVER been run out of a restaurant in my life.  It was so embarrassing and extremely rude.  After all, the restaurant was not busy at all during our visit.  Shocked and embarrassed, we left the restaurant.  Luckily we found a picnic table in the shade toward the edge of the parking lot and quite enjoyed our forced picnic lunch.\n\nI will never patronize this business again.  If you care anything about good service, find somewhere else to go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-08-19T13:40:17-0400", "location_id": "3355812", "id": "137668209", "user": {"username": "Lan98226", "user_location": {"name": "Bellingham, Washington", "id": "58350"}}}]}
