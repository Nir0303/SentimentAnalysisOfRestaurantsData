It is located in a strip center in Cedar Park and the appearance of the restaurant itself is average at best.  But don't let that stop you!  They have a varied menu of Thai dishes, and if you're a lover of Thai food, you won't be disappointed.  We had a party of 3 that visited during a week night.  It wasn't very crowded the night we were there. I ordered an appetizer of the vegetarian egg rolls and they were outstanding.  They were larger than normal and loaded with cabbage & veggies and it came with a sweet, red chili dipping sauce.  For entrees my wife had the pad thai with chicken, the other person in our party had the sweet & sour Thai chicken and I had the Thai noodles with beef.  My wife loved her Pad Thai.  The chicken was tender & flavorful, the noodles were done perfectly and it came with fresh bean sprouts, other veggies and crushed peanuts.  The person who had the Thai sweet and sour chicken went crazy over it!!  The Thai style comes with sliced, unbreaded chicken with lots of fresh carrots and other vegetables.  My dish was probably the most disappointing.  I like spicy Thai dishes and I ordered a \"4\" out of 5 on the spice scale and I was not disappointed in that.  It definitely was spicy - the way I like it!  There was not a lot of beef in my dish.  It was cut up into small pieces -- which is okay -- but it was very tough.  I'd go with the chicken the next time.  The prices are very reasonable and I can't say enough about the excellent service we received from our server.

On each occasion, we missed Thamnak Thai's dishes at home! This says it all about our opinion on this Thai restaurant.\nIt is a family oriented, located in a hard to find strip mall in Cedar Park, north of Austin, with plenty of parking spaces. The restaurant is kind of a smaller size. The chef cook is from Northern Thailand and her husband is running the dining area. They are both super nice. And their food, as we headlined it, is better than Thai dishes in Thailand, in our own opinion. (Disclosure: we are Vietnamese Americans). The one thing that could be improved is faster service!\nWe always order Panang Tofu with Curry, Pad See EEw with squids, Tamarine and Fish Sauce Fish dish, Clear Noodle with Chicken Soup. Always! And the price is just right!

While you can get a meal for $5-$10, it is not because the ingredients are cheap or the portions are skimpy. Whenever I eat there, I get enough food for two meals, and enjoy it the second day just as much as I did when it was served to me fresh and hot. The service is also splendid for the most part, and they are willing to adjust dishes to your personal taste. For example, I love their green curry fried rice but I prefer it at two star spiciness rather than the three it is listed at. Thamnak Thai's lunch menu boasts their most popular dishes and generously comes with soup and an egg roll, all for under $10. Their dinner menu contains a wide variety of dishes, including soups, noodles, fried rice, curries, and seafood. Their seafood is high quality, so you might pay a little more for it, but you are much less likely to have adverse gastrointestinal effects. There is no price for avoiding sickness! The red snapper is absolutely phenomenal, so order that and don't share, because you will finish it by yourself. The restaurant has lots of booths and Thai decor, providing a cozy atmosphere that is casual but not trashy. Overall, I highly recommend Thamnak Thai as a great place to take your family, friends, or coworkers.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2011-09-13T21:52:09-0400", "location_id": "894253", "id": "118095228", "user": {"username": "whooitsleah", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2011-07", "title": "Addicting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55599-d894253-r116621996-m11068-Thamnak_Thai-Cedar_Park_Texas.html#review116621996", "text": "This has been one of our family favorites for 3 years.
