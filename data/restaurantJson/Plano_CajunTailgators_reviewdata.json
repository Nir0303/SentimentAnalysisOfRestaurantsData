It was the best thing I had eaten in a long, long time (their cajun fries are good, too!). So I started following Cajun Tailgators on Instagram where I learned they had a brick & mortar location in downtown Plano, and I didn't have to hunt for the truck to see where they'd be in Dallas next! I was stoked. I took my wife and kids - my daughter loved the Pistolette, too. My wife and son had the red beans and rice with andouille sausage. We finished with beignets. It's a small eatery, but everything is made fresh. I like the atmosphere; it felt like Louisiana (to me, as a non-native having only visited NOLA briefly). I can't wait to go back.

Our experience was great. \n\nWhen we arrived we went right up to the counter (this is a place where you order from the color-filled chalkboard behind the front counter, you pay and they bring your food to you), we asked for recommendations; the helpful employee recommended the gumbo, boudin balls, crawfish platter or the crawfish etouffee. The three of us ordered all that plus a salad and red beans and rice. Everything was very good but was spicy. Of course cajun food is typically spicy. The boudin balls reminded me of pepper balls I used to get 30 years ago in Denton; they were a nice surprise. We decided to add beignets. They were fresh, hot and hit the spot.\n\nThe dining room is small and consists of only a few tables - 20 or so people would fill the place up. Outside the have a side patio that can seat another 10 or so. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the cool March evening. On the patio are two pickup truck tailgates mounted to the building's outside wall and which serve as counter height tables - pretty cool.\n\nWe will certainly go back.

The crawfish pistolette was amazing! I visited again during September 2014 and was disappointed.  The boudin balls were fried way too long causing them to be so dry that I could barely choke them down. The meat pie was just okay.

Either the cook and/or the recipe had changed because this was without a doubt the nastiest tasting crud that I have ever tried to eat. First, it tasted old and rancid...like old grease smells. Second, it was so ridiculously spicy that I couldn't have enjoyed it even if it did taste good. Possibly the cook was trying to scorch my taste buds so that I couldn't tell that I was served a bowl of nasty. The crackers served with the gumbo were stale so that only made it worse.
