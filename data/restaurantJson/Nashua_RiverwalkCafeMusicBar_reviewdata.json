Quaint coffee shop in the center of Nashua. While waiting for the jazz group we had dinner. Menu is limited and we decided to order multiple appetizers and a bottle of wine. No complaints at all. Food and wine was good and so was the service. We also  tried a couple of cocktails which were also good. The band was great.The scene is very intimate and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We'll return", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-28T05:44:28-0500", "location_id": "4086017", "id": "343313910", "user": {"username": "mjmNJ", "user_location": {"name": "Nashua, New Hampshire", "id": "46172"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Excellent coffee and veggie wrap", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46172-d4086017-r339966901-m11068-Riverwalk_Cafe_Music_Bar-Nashua_New_Hampshire.html#review339966901", "text": "Stopped in while on business in the area.
