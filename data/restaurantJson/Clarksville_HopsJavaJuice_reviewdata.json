Thankfully, we were introduced to Hops Java a few months into our move and we have been coffee'ing up there ever since. My husband, a cold brew fiend, raves about their cold brew-- it's so smooth and Hops uses (if memory serves me well) a 5 (or is it 7?) step filtered water system to make the coffee extra good. Their dirty chai latte-- iced or cold-- is my FAVORITE! Hops also gets their pastries from a local bakery and they are killer. The cinnamon rolls, twists, and raspberry danishes are delicious.

(the-honest-traveler.blogspot.com)\n\nThe Good: I love Starbucks, but I think I like Hops Java & Juice even more. Why? It's all about buying local.\n\nNot to mention that the food was excellent.  They serve all sorts of coffee shop beverages, smoothies, chips and sandwiches, gluten free baked goods, even treats for your canine!\n\nAt the time of my visit, the barista told me that Hops Java & Juice plans to soon incorporate live entertainment into its roster.\n\nLocated in a beautiful historic downtown, its a nice place to cool down on a visit to the Clarksville Farmer's Market, held right across the street.\n\nThe Bad: I think Starbucks is expensive.  I love it, yes, perhaps I am a coffee addict, but expensive it still remains. The prices at Hops Java & Juice rival those of Starbucks. For example, frappuccinos come in one size, approximately a venti, for about the same price. But I can give them a little slack on the price, as they are a \"mom and pop\" establishment rather than a chain.\n\nThe Delicious: Not only was my frappuccino tasty, but there were some enormous \"Big Daddy\" cookies calling my name--five inch behemoths filled with chocolate chunks!  This little coffee shop is definitely on my list of places to visit again.\n\nThe Confusing: Since the word \"hops\" was included in the name, I expected to find a microbrewery tucked away inside. No such luck, but there is always the Blackhorse down the street.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-26T17:02:26-0400", "location_id": "8418318", "id": "386253982", "user": {"username": "Cara_Siera", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Little Place Downtown to get Ice Cream, Smoothies, Coffee, Etc.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54955-d8418318-r362062325-m11068-Hops_Java_Juice-Clarksville_Tennessee.html#review362062325", "text": "Visited here after eating at Hops Road, when we realized that the owner's wife had a bakery across the street. We went in, not exactly knowing what to find. It is a very cute cafe with a few places to sit. She has ice cream, coffee and tea, and smoothies. Her smoothies are all natural with no additive base, like orange juice, for example. She also had a great selection of little bars, teas, soaps, and a little area with dog stuff, leashes, dog treats, etc. It was also great to see a little bake case with to go lunches, sandwiches, cheesecake, canoli, cupcakes, etc. The place was very clean, well lit, although the layout was a little weird. The bake case, ice cream, register area was nice. I just thought it was odd that the kitchen area was open, with shelving to divide it. The kitchen area and register/bake case are diagonally across from each other on each side. The owner was very nice and friendly, and very informative when I asked about the smoothies. We had the mint chocolate chip and birthday cake ice cream. It was awesome!
