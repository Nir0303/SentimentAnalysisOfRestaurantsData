If you've never tried a Sizzler, then a) you must and b) this one in Pico is great!.\nEnough food until you want to explode! There's heaps of variety and it's mostly fresh. Whilst a lot of fast food joints deep fry or griddle everything, Sizzler gives a little more. It's incredibly competitively priced, and the service when we went was attentive and thourough. If you are a food and service snob, then keep away. BUT if you appreciate value, big servings and good service, this is the place to come. We always do a Sizzler when we visit California from England, and they never disappoint. 5 Stars!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-10-14T19:32:50-0400", "location_id": "4955739", "id": "181070921", "user": {"username": "Ron_Elvins1962", "user_location": {"name": "Bideford, United Kingdom", "id": "190807"}}}]}
