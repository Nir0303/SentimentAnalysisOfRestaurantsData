I met a friend there last week. I was glad I had the certificate, because the prices were higher than anticipated. I had no idea what to expect when I walked in the door. In my mind I had pictured a long counter with tables on the sides, like an old fashioned soda fountain. I also thought that since they called themselves a lunch box, perhaps the food would come in brown paper bags. Instead I found a relatively small counter, about six booths, and some small tables. We had to order our food at the counter, and then they brought it out. I had the Boneless Buffalo Chicken Wrap with grilled chicken. It was $8.49 without any chips, fries or beverage. I thought that was a bit steep. It did taste good, however. It was spicy, and also messy.   The d\u00e9cor was modern, but the entryway had a cozy, antique feel with old books on bookshelves. They close by 2:30, so it is not a spot to eat and then linger over coffee with a friend. It was quite busy over the lunch hour.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-19T16:30:20-0400", "location_id": "5933967", "id": "320239088", "user": {"username": "Patricia B", "user_location": {"name": "St. Augusta, Minnesota, United States", "id": null}}}]}
