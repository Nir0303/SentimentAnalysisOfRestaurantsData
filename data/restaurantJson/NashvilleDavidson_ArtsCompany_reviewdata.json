As Anne is the owner of this gallery, The Arts Company is perhaps the best gallery in town.  Whether you enjoy contemporary art from legendary artists like Brother Mel, Ed Clark, and Lonnie Holley, or you want to browse through the newest up-and-comers, The Arts Company is definitely worth taking the time to check out.  With a steady rotation in the downstairs gallery, you never know what you might see on any given day.  If you don't find what you are looking for, the incredibly kind staff may lead you upstairs where the abundance of collectable art is endless.  It is the perfect place if you are an avid collector, artist, businessman, college student, or just want to take a break from you day. A must see when you are in Nashville.  My personal favorites are the classic Ed Clark (LIFE photographer) photographs from a night at the Grand Ole Opry in 1946.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-09-25T09:06:13-0400", "location_id": "591270", "id": "230891491", "user": {"username": "Matthew F", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
