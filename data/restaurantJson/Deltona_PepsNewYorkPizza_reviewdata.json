The sausage was sliced not crumbled bits of meat. Which I loved! The knish was split open and there should have been more filling but the filling was flavorful. The zeppoles were not in the box. It was an order of garlic knots. They were okay. Really disapointed to not have the zeppoles. Didn't call back to complain about the switch. Will go back though. If I get my zeppoles maybe I will rate higher. If they can do those right I will be a customer for a long time to come.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-04-09T11:26:23-0400", "location_id": "4695983", "id": "157228012", "user": {"username": "Kelly32725", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
