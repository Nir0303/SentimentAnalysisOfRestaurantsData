IT'S A PIZZA SHOP. In Sam's case though, they are the only ones I order from in Yonkers. I can only speak to the food and the delivery, as I have only been inside the shop once and that was to pick up a pizza. \n\nFood: For me Sam's pizza is not their highlight. It's average and its okay. It is definitely not the best. Pizza I have ordered has been \"dead\" (flat, boring, in need of more sauce or cheese). When I ordered pies with toppings, it seems as though they try to make a little look like alot. Definitely worth passing over. On the other hand, Sam's is my #1 spot for heroes, sandwiches, and salads. OMG! My favorite sandwich to order from them is chicken salad, which is delicious. I have also tried their Chicken Parm, which too me is great. Their fries are good too. I would have to say their specialty is there wedges.\n\nDelivery: I would recommend if you have to get their food delivered, order it at least an hour to and hour and half in advance. Sam's could be the slowest place for delivery, and if you're really hungry do not wait until the last minute to order. On the other hand, their delivery people are always friendly and nice, and definitely worth tipping. So far despite them taking forever to get to their destination, the food has never been cold in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I would recommend giving Sam's a try for their wedges Skip the pizza though.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-05-25T08:10:26-0400", "location_id": "4254284", "id": "206971611", "user": {"username": "T R", "user_location": {"name": "White Plains, New York", "id": "48883"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "Outstanding hero and pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48922-d4254284-r177220314-m11068-Sam_s_Wedges_Pizzeria-Yonkers_New_York.html#review177220314", "text": "Their Italian hero and pizza are the real thing.
