From the front desk staff, especially Nahla, to the breakfast crew, to the housekeeping and grounds staff, everyone was friendly and appeared to take pride in their service.  A staff that seems to enjoy their work is usually a reflection of positive management too.  We have a service dog that has her own needs too and often in the Phoenix area you can't find nice grass near hotels. The grounds have beautiful patches of soft grass, is clean and shady, and there is a great big field of grass right across the street.  They are also pet friendly though there is a non refundable fee. If you have an event at the Sports complex it would be perfect but I would stay here again even if it was a bit out of the way. The breakfast is a full one and better than you would get at most restaurants and there is comfortable shady seating outdoors as well as simple and tastefully decorated inside eating and conversation areas. There is a decent little pool/jacuzzi, a small basketball court, corn hole, and a cozy fire pit conversation area. Of course like all Residence Inns there is a nice full kitchen in each room as well, minus an oven.
