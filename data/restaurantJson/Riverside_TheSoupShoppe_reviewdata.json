Even though there was only one other couple in the resturant our waitress seemed rushed. I have food allergies and asked a couple of questions and she seemed as if was bothersome to answer them. The resturant itself felt dirty, it really could use an update and good cleaning. My daughter got breakfast, my husband half a ham salad sandwich with barley soup and I opted for the  patty melt with a cup of turkey noodle soup. The breakfast was just okay, she actually didn't finish the eggs saying they were rubbery. My husband liked his, just mentioned a little saltey on the soup. I had to hunt for the beef on the sandwich, way too much butter used to grill the bread it fell apart and I ordered it with grilled onions and the waitress had to go back and bring them to me. They came in huge slices. The noodles in the soup were mushy, but it had good flavor.

They learn quickly your specific breakfast quirks (there's always a little peanut butter to go with my pancakes), and they know I'm going to use all the cream for my coffee.  The Soup Shoppe is friendly and simple.  It's perfect for a breakfast meeting (of which I have a lot).  It's perfect for hanging out.  It's perfect for visiting with friends from the neighborhood.  The food isn't going to get them in the Michelin guidebook, but it's simple, basic, and ample without being piggish in proportion.
