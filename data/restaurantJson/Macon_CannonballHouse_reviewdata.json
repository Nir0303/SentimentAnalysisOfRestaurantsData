Jessie was our guide, and she is fantastic.  The parlors that are devoted to Phi Mu and A D Pi history were the highlight for us, of course, and the reason we visited, but the rest of the home is worth taking in as well.  \nBorn a Yankee, I found the dining room fascinating - each chair seat depicts the state seal of a different confederate state done in needlepoint - and the chairs are arranged around the room in the order of secession from the Union.  Jessie told us that the local Sidney Lanier chapter of the UDC made them, and often meets there.   And speaking of Sidney Lanier, there is a nice painted portrait of him in the front hall.  He was born in a home nearby.\nThis home has a nice little gift shop, kitchen building at the back, back garden, and free parking in back which can be accessed from a side street or from a narrow side alley.  Note that you must climb a few stairs to get in and out of the house, and climb a full set of stairs in order to see the upstairs, as there is no elevator.  Admission prices are very reasonable.  I recommend that you plan to spend around 2 hours here.\n\nThe historical section of Macon is lovely and has much to see.  What a blessing that the river was flooded which prevented Union troops from burning Macon during the March to the Sea!\nI would love to go back and spend a day or two looking around the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-17T21:20:57-0400", "location_id": "3317094", "id": "429016269", "user": {"username": "Thrifty3", "user_location": {"name": "Fayette County, Georgia", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "An unexpected surprise ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60920-d3317094-r426332014-m11068-Cannonball_House-Macon_Georgia.html#review426332014", "text": "Making our way to Florida while avoiding Matthew, we found ourselves in Macon on Saturday mid afternoon.
