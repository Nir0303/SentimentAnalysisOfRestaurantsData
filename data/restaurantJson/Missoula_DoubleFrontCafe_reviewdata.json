Per the website: \n\nThe Double Front was built in 1909, with no alley or back door and so was properly named with a front door at 122 Alder St. and another at 121 Railroad St. In the early years between 1909 and 1920, the building was used mostly as a pool hall. \n\nAfter 1920, during prohibition days, the building became a residence and rumor has it some bootlegging may have occurred. In 1934 and 1935 when beer and wine became legal again, the residence changed to a bar and was owned by the Mangan family. It was that year that chicken was first served at the Double Front. \n\nManagers over the years included Elmer Shea in 1948 and George Austin in 1952. After an auto accident which took Mr. Austin's life in 1959, the Double Front was run by the estate until 1961, at which time the Herndon family bought the cafe and started remodeling the building. Although big changes in appearance have taken place over the years, the quality of our chicken has remained the same. All chicken is cooked to order, and it's always fresh, never frozen...because the best takes a little longer - just as it did in 1935!\n\nAs posted, the chicken was cooked to order, and it actually took longer than they anticipated.  For our troubles, the waitress said we were being offered an appetizer on the house.  We told her to suggest something, and she said their breaded fried mushrooms were popular.\n\nThe mushrooms were fantastic, and so was the chicken. It was definitely worth the wait.  We ordered the white meat chicken dinner, which was 2 whole breasts, with the wing attached, fries and pickles for $13.00.  Stephen and I decided to share the dinner, and we added a side order of cole slaw for $3.00.  There's no sales tax in Montana, I guess.  Our meal with 2 beers and a diet coke came to just $24.50!

Still owned by the Herndon family, who started the place back I think in the 30's.  As a disclaimer I have known the Herndons for about 30 years.\n\nThey do have a few other things on the menu, but if you want burgers get them elsewhere.  This place does chicken, and they do it well.\n\nNo it's not \"Southern Style\" whatever that is.  The chicken is delivered fresh daily, never frozen, breaded with a secret recipe and deep fried in pure vegetable oil which is changed daily.  For what you get the meal is a real deal, and you won't find better chicken anywhere in Montana, and maybe not anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line.  \n\nYou can get a half chicken, or just the dark half or the white meat half.  You can get a half order of either white or dark meat.  With fries of course, and salad if you want.  The chicken is cooked to order only and takes 25-30 minutes.  Alcoholic beverages are available, there is a full bar in the basement.\n\nSeating is a bit limited, but they do a huge takleout business.  Call your order in in advance.  \n\nI wish I could eat their chicken more often, but the doctor says to stay away from all that sort of stuff.
