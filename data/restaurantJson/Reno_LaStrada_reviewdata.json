We started out with a combination of mushroom ravioli and shrimp wrapped in prosciutto. The combination plate of the 2 popular starters was not on the menu, but suggested by the waiter. The mushroom ravioli were, as other reviewers have stated, really delicious. The shrimp were good, but not sensational. I got veal osso buco, which was very tender and tasty, but it was served on a very rich, cheesy risotto, which became cloying after a few forkfuls. I think it would be better if it had been combined with a different side. My husband got tiny veal chops Milanese, which I think was breaded too heavily, and also chewy. The taste was good, though. His sides of carrots and potatoes were very good. We shared creme brulee for dessert, which was fine. I was disappointed in the bread served at the table. Coming from the east coast, and also having dined in Florence and Rome, I found the bread not crusty enough, and too soft.
