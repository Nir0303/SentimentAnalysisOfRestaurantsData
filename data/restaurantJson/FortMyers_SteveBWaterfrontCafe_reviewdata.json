She walked next to the bar where there was a cooler and a microwave and then appeared with our burgers. It was so strange - there was no cook top or grill to be seen. How did they make the burgers? Were they cooked earlier and just microwaved? It was scary and confusing at the same time. The burger had a funky smoky sweet flavor that I wasn't sure was good or terrible. It came with two sides that were served in small condiment containers. One cool thing about this place is that that server brought some slices of lemon loaf to the table as a free dessert.
