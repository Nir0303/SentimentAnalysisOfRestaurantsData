But there were lots of cars going thru the drive thru and a number of people had phoned ahead for orders to go.  Thelma was working the counter.  She pointed out that if we wanted they would fixed burgers instead of breakfast.  We opted for the breakfast tacos.  I had the bacon and egg.  My wife had the potato and egg.  We both thought they were very good.  They were piping hot when we got them.  We will definitely stop by again for breakfast.

This is a sign in any urban area of plentiful good food at reasonable prices. Add to this the number of local police who pull in for a burger or a shake during the day and you have a pretty accurate indicator that no matter what the place may look like, the food is great.\n\nMy traveling partner and I have been fortunate enough to try this no-frills, fast-food outpost several times.\n\nEating in their small dining room is an adventure, though we have yet to try going through their drive-thru window.\n\nTheir menu is pretty eclectic, with not only burgers and fries, but items like gyros, seafood baskets (catfish, shrimp, clams, stuffed crab), BLT's, and club sandwiches. They also have a lot of daily specials and new menu items posted on hand-lettered signs in the windows.\n\nSome of our favorites so far stand out. Chili Pie Start with a deep layer of Fritoes, then smother them in a meaty chili, a heavy sprinkle of cheddar, and, at your request, a spot of diced onion. The gang at Burger Boy build an outstanding chili pie that hits the spot in summer and warms you to your toes in winter. I am picky about my chili pie, and these folks please me to no end consistently when I visit. T\n\nhe burgers are stuffed with meat, cheese and veggies. You are welcome to order a single, a double, or if you ask nicely and are willing to pay the extra, a triple. The buns are soft and butter grilled giving them extra flavor and texture. The veggies are always fresh and plentiful, as are the pickles if you ask.\n\nThe fried catfish is available in a basket with fries, a small salad, and a grilled bread, or in a sandwich with whatever veggies you desire. The fish is always tasty with breading that is neither too thick or overpoweringly spiced. Either serving is a good-sized meal.\n\nFrench-fried potatoes only come in one size and flavor, but they are always cooked to a turn, and crispy when fresh. Thick cut, the skin is tender as it cools, while the interior of each fry is soft and sqishy - just like a fry aught to be.\n\nShakes Always thick and creamy, the shakes and malts here are lovely. They offer vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry consistently.\n\nIf you chance to travel through Conroe, keep your eyes open for this hole-in-the-wall establishment on East Davis, across the street from Fiesta. It's about a mile off I-45 facing the eastbound side of Davis.\n\n-- Ann Cathey", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-02-14T04:28:19-0500", "location_id": "4640399", "id": "347579502", "user": {"username": "Denah H", "user_location": {"name": "Conroe, Texas", "id": "55667"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Best Burger in Town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55667-d4640399-r339655826-m11068-Burger_Boy-Conroe_Texas.html#review339655826", "text": "The place somewhat has the looks against it but the food is absolutely great and everything is home made.
