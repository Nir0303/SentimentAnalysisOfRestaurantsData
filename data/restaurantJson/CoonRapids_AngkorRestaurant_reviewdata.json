It was a cold night, so the windows were very steamy. Plus the place could use better ventilation because the heat and smells from the kitchen overwhelm the restaurant. It is in a hole in the wall old strip mall. But don't let the looks deceive you. You can see the kitchen from the front room and it is clean. Angkor has the best Asian food in the area. We had the cream cheese wontons which were crunchy, sweet, and cheesy - the perfect blend. We followed this up with their pork egg rolls. Now the egg rolls are not typical cabbage filled Chinese egg rolls. The place is Cambodian after all. The Cambodian egg rolls lean towards Vietnamese style egg rolls. Angkor's pork egg rolls were so much better than typical fare. For entree's we chose beef lo mien, sesame chicken and house fried rice. The beef lo mien was better than the other lo mien offered by other places in the area. The noodles were very delicate. The sesame chicken was good but not great. Next time I'll try the General Tsao chicken or another alternate. The house fried rice was outstanding. It was filled with various meats. They do not skimp on the protein. They had shrimp, bbq pork, chicken, etc. in the rice along with a lot of egg which I like. It was the best fried rice I have had in a long time. Also remember when your order totals more than $20, they will give you either free pop, egg rolls, or won tons. The delivery charge is $2. I think I will take advantage of that next time.
