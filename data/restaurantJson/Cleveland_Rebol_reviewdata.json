I had a hard time deciding how to categorize the cuisine at Rebol.  They have taken the \"Chipotle\" concept (here are our ingredients - build you entree from these) and given it a healthy/vegan/organic twist.  You can choose from 6 \"chef constructed\" bols or build your own.  Ingredients include:  Grass-fed beef; chicken; pork; wild tuna or vegan chicken tikka.  Put that on a base of sticky rice; spinach and romaine; zucchini & squash noodles or shirataki noodles.  Top with choice of spicy green beans; cabbage slaw; kale & cashew slaw; papaya & carrot slaw or steamed broccoli.  Then you add a sauce and garnishes and you're ready to eat.  You have full vegan choices, Paleo options and Gluten-free options.  Everything is 100% non-GMO and all the meats are organic as is the produce (when available.)  They have some sides, an organic coffee bar and also serve some interesting mixed drinks and craft beers.   How did a confirmed carnivore do here?  Not too badly!  I enjoyed a beef bol with curry and slaw.  There are a couple other items I want to try next time I'm there.  (See... couldn't have been too bad... I'm already planning the next visit!)  Located right on the newly renovated Public Square, you have your choice of sitting outside and enjoying the sights and activities on the Square or grabbing a seat in air conditioned comfort inside.  I wish the tag for 3 stars indicated something other than \"average.\"  Rebol certainly isn't average fast food but with so many great restaurants located within a couple of blocks, it wouldn't be fair to equate them with the 4-star restaurants.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-08T10:20:01-0400", "location_id": "10714473", "id": "402898605", "user": {"username": "Tribe_TV", "user_location": {"name": "Cleveland", "id": null}}}]}
