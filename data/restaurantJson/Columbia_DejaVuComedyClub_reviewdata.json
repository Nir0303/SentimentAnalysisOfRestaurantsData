Ample street and garage parking is available.  Club is clean, safe and well managed.  Courteous staff.  Dress code is enforced.  Drinks are average price for a college town.

I suggest you always research the specific comedian who is headlining to ensure you see the type of comedy you are expecting to see.

My husband, our friends and I were having a fantastic evening until our waitress. Not only was the rudest person we have ever encountered but every time she bend over to take our order you could see right up her too short tight dress. It was even more appalling than the ladies on the high dance bar we had to see later in the night. Her breath behind her crooked smile was horrendous and because of the loud music she had to yell to take our order. We watched her take not only our order but the 3 other tables around us as well. It took over 35 minutes to just get 1 drink each. The tables next to us did not seem very happy either. We had already finished our food by the time we got those drink (which happened to be 4/8 correct).  I tried to place a complaint but management was \"busy.\" Besides the comic the night was horrible. Needless to say we will not be going there ever again.
