I must commend Lacey and Kayla for their welcoming and warm customer service.  Lacey greeted us, and helped turn my day around just by the friendly manner by which she took our order.  The way this restaurant is set-up is that you walk up to the counter and place your drink and food order, then another employee brings your meal to your table.  As I waited for my food, I commented to my friend that Lacey's personable approach put a smile on my face and helped change my day for the better.  Next, Kayla brought our food to the table, with continued warmth, and great attention to detail.  She brought us refills before we could ask, and quickly corrected a small omission on my order.  Finally, my taco Tuesday meal was phenomenal. My portions were splendid and the steak was tender.  I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, timely and attractive presentation of the meal, and for the reasonable prices. Especially, I will return for the amazing service offered by these two young ladies.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-29T10:23:42-0400", "location_id": "2329887", "id": "432710697", "user": {"username": "viviangray1", "user_location": {"name": "Wellington, Florida", "id": "34727"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "GREAT fast Mexican food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34727-d2329887-r429136048-m11068-Tijuana_Flats-Wellington_Florida.html#review429136048", "text": "Great spot in Wellington to enjoy some quick delicious Mexican food.
