Crowded, but that's to be expected when the entertainment is free. Fairly clean and easily accessible. Security isn't great. I usually carry a minimum of two pocketknives at all times, and although security checked my purse, they didn't see either of them - and both were easily visible, one clipped in a pocket inside my purse, and the other clipped in a pocket on the outside of my purse. It really never occurred to me that they might check, so when they did, I expected them to send me back to my car to leave my knives, but since they didn't even see obviously placed ones, I don't think they're doing a stellar job. So that's a concern, in my opinion. However, I did not witness any fights or other obvious disturbances, so that was good. The sound system is fantastic. Remember to bring lawn chairs! Honestly, it isn't a place I would go to frequently because I don't like crowds or being outdoors, but a friend's band was playing, and I wasn't going to miss that. I'm really glad I went, though, because seriously, the sound system really is fantastic.
