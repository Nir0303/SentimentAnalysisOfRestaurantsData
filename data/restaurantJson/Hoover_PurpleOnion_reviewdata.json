Their menu consists of gyros (sort of, but the tzatziki is made of mayo instead of yogurt), American Diner foods (like burgers and fries), \"seafood\" (a shrimp kabob and a tilapia fillet were the only options last time I was there), Pita wraps (never had one, might be their saving grace), and \"bakers\", which are pretty much just baked potatoes topped with different toppings. \n\nTheir offering is like the restaurant started out as a diner, decided it wanted to try its hand at foreign (Mediterranean) food, panicked, tried to pivot back to American food, then decided it wanted to be healthy as an after thought. I've had gyros here (terrible shriveled up slices of meat on hard pita with mayo-based \"tzatziki\" and half a pound of shredded ice burg), as well as a burger (dry and uninspired), a bbq gyro baker (actually that was pretty good, but the potato was a little burnt on the outside, and I eat the skin so that was a disappointment - plus the green onions just were too much), and a tilapia plate (just a typical serving of grilled tilapia - nothing bad, but nothing outstanding). \n\nI keep going back to this restaurant because my friends like it (like, not love) and it does have decent prices. One thing I do enjoy about it is the ice mint tea that's available - it's really refreshing. And, I'm a sucker for a massive pile of fries (and you get massive piles of fries with the burgers) and one of those ketchup bottles that squirts out a thin string of ketchup. Plus, one of them (not this one, in Hoover, but the one on 10th Ave South in Birmingham) gives a student discount. \n\nOver all, if you don't know what you want and want as many cheap options as possible while not caring about the quality of the food, this is the next best thing you could pick... if you care about the quality, go grocery shopping. But don't go here expecting the finest gyro and hummus you've ever had. You will be sorely disappointed.

Traveling on Christmas Day for family and we decided to stop here. \n\nThe place is a converted Shoneys \"Greek\" Food fast casual, just without the fast part!\n\nThere menu is huge and honestly way to big. Looks as if they are desperate to make money so they have about anything you could think of.\n\nWhen we arrived , 4 people in front of us at the counter.  With the the lady at the register taking orders , she picked up the phone every minute or so when it rang. On the phone for about 3 mins per call. RUDE...... We customers in front of her are here already ready to give you are money and eat. People on the phone will call back.\nThis never stopped.   Lady was very short with us , did not give us a receipt for our food. Gave us a number and then the waiting truly started.\n\nWe ordered: a ribeye pita and a falafel plate. It took 40 minutes to get our food . It seemed as if the pickup orders were more important than the sit down customers. \n\nThe floors were very slick and people were actually trying not to fall . I mean the entire floor was slick. Not sure why.\n\nWhen I got our food (finally) after me going up to register and saying just refund our money we haven't got our food yet. She turned around and the plates that had been seen sitting there for at least 10 mins were ours.  She proceeded to give it to us and I asked if it is still warm. She said yes and just handed to us without as much as an apology.\n\nNow for the food-\nWe LOVE Greek food and this was about lowest quality you could get. My pita barely had any ribeye in it and very small portion. \nAlso they put mayo and mustard on it, wow is all I can say. The Falafel plate was rice , falafel , salad and hummus. Falafel okay, rice okay, salad dressing on salad good but hard to eat whole veggies with no way to cut it up and also styrofoam. Hummus had a pungent artificial flavor to it. \n\nPricing - $6.50 pita, $3.49 fries, Falafel plate $10+ . Couldn't remember exact price since we don't have receipt.  Drinks - total $27+.  Also note you can only get 1 refill on your drink.\n\nSo if you wan to wait with rudeness and below standard food, this would be right up your alley.
