Unfortunately, it wasn't made clear on their website that the \"daily\" buffet wasn't available on Sunday, at least not the day we went there.  After getting over the initial disappointment, we reviewed their special luncheon menu.  Pricing for your entree, which includes Naan and rice, was $8.99 pp.  They did provide us each with bottled water, which they charged extra for.  I didn't have an issue with this; however, you should be aware there's an extra charge for beverages.  The gentleman who waited on us was very polite and professional and the meals were served very quickly. My husband and my daughter's boyfriend both ordered the Chili Chicken, my daughter ordered the White Lentil entree and I ordered one of my favorite entrees, the Palak Paneer.  I took a taste of both my husband's and daughter's entrees and, I can tell you, all three of these were very flavorful and absolutely delicious!  The Naan was fresh, warm and soft.  The rice was also very good and complimented our dishes perfectly.  The venue itself is small, but very nicely decorated and has high ceilings that give it a more spacious feeling.  All-in-all, we enjoyed the restaurant and plan to go back for the buffet.....but will be sure to call ahead to ensure they're serving it on the day we plan to go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-07-30T07:42:14-0400", "location_id": "4020885", "id": "218460025", "user": {"username": "SummerMama57", "user_location": {"name": "Mid-Hudson Valley, NY", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Oh So Spicy!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48922-d4020885-r202113634-m11068-Nawab_Pakistani_Indian_Cuisine-Yonkers_New_York.html#review202113634", "text": "First visit to this little neighborhood spot.It isn't very big but well laid out.
