Pono specializes in delicious Hawaiian dishes, done just right. They have an entire menu category devoted to poke (pronounced \"po-kay\")., which is basically chunks of raw ahi tuna with spicy sauce.  My favorite is the wasabe poke tower, which has great fresh ahi, avocado, and chips all piled up.  Just the snack to enjoy with a Longboard draft beer or Hawaiian mai tai from their full bar.  They always have a line out the door at lunch and happy hour.  In summer, you can sit out on the back patio.  They also feature live music several nights a week.
