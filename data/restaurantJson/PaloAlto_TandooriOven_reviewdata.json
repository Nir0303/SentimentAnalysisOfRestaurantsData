They were sort of bland as the hot level of set at zero.  Samosas were good and Naan and rice are among their best.

Plus a discount on beers.\n\nWe got the paneer masala and the kofta curry, as well as two samosas, with some naan.  I think the samosas were the high point of the meal-- super potato-y and flavorful, and they come in a bed of a sweet garbanzo bean stew.  Smush that samosa around in that stew.  There you go.  That's the stuff.\n\nBoth the curries were hell of spicy, and they weren't the typical masala/kofta that we're used to.  Maybe it's just us, but the paneer masala I've had in the past is very creamy, and the koftas are usually very doughy/cheesy/soft and come in a similarly creamy sauce.  These were both more tomato-based sauces, maybe?  Definitely not creamy and quite hot!  Next time we'd definitely get some raita to go along... Very necessary!\n\nGood portion sizes-- I just wish there was one curry that was in that creamy, comforting style that I'm used to.  I'd like to try a wrap next time-- maybe the extra bread will help stave off the tears!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-02-03T11:40:04-0500", "location_id": "3786213", "id": "151334466", "user": {"username": "ajhorse21", "user_location": {"name": "Mountain View, California", "id": "32761"}}}]}
