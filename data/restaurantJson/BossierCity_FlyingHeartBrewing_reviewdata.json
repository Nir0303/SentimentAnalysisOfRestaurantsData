She mentioned that she had not been to the Flying Heart Brewery yet, so I said I'd go and check it out since i had not as well.\nI looked the address up and to my suprise I knew the address, but not as the brewery. I made my way to Bossier City and onto Traffic St. And then onto Barksdale Blvd. This used to be Bossier City Fire Station No. 6 next to the old city hall and across the street from a nice little Italian restaurant \" Lil Italiano .\" \nThe atmosphere is open air with tables and chairs in the main bays and out on the driveway. If you are there when the Fire truck and Firemen who served this location is traveling back to their new location, they blow the fire truck horn and wave. I've been there several times and each time this was a happening. They have fans running for the heat of our area and a cold beer makes it better. There are food truck for your dining fares and of course you can order appetizers from the Italian restaurant across the street.\nThe beers at Flying Heart are not very hopsy, but smooth. I have 2 favorites from their 6 or 7 beers offered. The Clementine Shandy is great if you like oranges and their Milk Stout is wonderful.\nThey have a Firehouse beer that is nice and a few others I've tried. I enjoyed every beer they have at Flying Heart even though I'm unable to name them all at the present. The Brewers put their hearts and passion into brewing a wonderful assortment of liquid refreshment.\nIt would be a wise choice to go visit this brewery in Bossier City.\nThey are open about 4p on Fridays and earlier on Saturdays. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Jennifer M, Public Relations Manager at Flying Heart Brewing, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for such a great review.
