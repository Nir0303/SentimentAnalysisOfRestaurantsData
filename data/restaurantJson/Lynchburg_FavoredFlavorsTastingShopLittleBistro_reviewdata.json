Christina and Jason love their business and it shows!  From the beautiful set up of the shop to the amazing selection of olive oils and  balsamic vinegars, this is a place not to miss. My favorites so far are the Blackberry Balsamic Vinegar (which is also great on popcorn) and the Butter flavored Olive Oil.

My husband and I were were walking around downtown when we just happened upon it. We went inside and started to taste their flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Absolutely everything we tried was delicious. We ended up buying 4 bottles of vinegar to give away as Christmas gifts. We will definitely return!
