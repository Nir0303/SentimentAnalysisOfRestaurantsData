One doesn't expect much from a place like this, but often one is pleasantly surprised.  Not the case here - staff is nice but really not helpful.  Long and unexplained wait at check-in (at 4 pm, so it wasn't like we were early), not just for us and several other people; first room smelled of stale cigarette smoke, second one of old cat urine (but we stayed in it, because we'd spent 15 minutes on hold trying to reach the desk and then 10 minutes in line to change the room).  The building is hard to navigate, passageways to room literally involve twisting around narrow corners filled with giant and EXTREMELY LOUD air conditioning units, the room itself is well equipped but terribly laid out and very outdated.  Threadbare sheets - always a telltale sign.  It's family friendly which is fine, but soundproofing is bad so the perpetually barking dog in the room next door was a bit of a distraction.  Shower is not quite hot enough, which one could almost predict.  The breakfast itself is actually quite good, and the staff is nice - but like the rooms the breakfast layout is awful - almost like it was designed for bleary-eyed people to run into each other with plates full of food.  AND breakfast is only served until 9:30 on weekends...a little shoddy.   No 'do not disturb' sign, just 'no service today' - and even with that the housekeeping staff knocked loudly on the door at 9 am on a Sunday, then again at 9:15!

Unfortunately, this Residence Inn failed to meet any of these expectations.  We weren't in our room five minutes when there was a knock on our door and a carpet cleaner was on the other side wanting to clean our carpets.  That would've been fine if we were just checking out, not checking in.  Our first night, we were awakened by the sound of a party in an adjacent room.  After calling the front desk several times, the police were called and removed the guests and their 10 friends.  This went on for 2 hours between 1 and 3am.  The next morning at breakfast, the General Manager came up and apologized for the inconvenience and stated he would credit my account all of the points used for that first night stay.  That would've been great if it had occurred.  Instead, my account was credit 1/3 of the points spent.  The breakfast also did not live up to my normal Marriott experience.  The sausage was clearly overcooked, and staff did not refill the fresh fruit upon request.  Our second night did not fare any better.  Again, we were awakened by partiers in an adjacent room.  This again went on for 2 hours and three calls to the front desk.  We finally fell asleep after 3:30 am.  When I spoke with Marriott in the morning, I was told the manager said nothing had happened that night.  I guess my wife and I imagined the noise and doors slamming shut at 2 am and 3 am.

So stayed here for about a month.  They are pet friendly, but no matter how many times you call before hand and talk to them, they will forget about the pet you wrote on the internet website.  We were placed in an amazingly nice room.  I even told them at check in about my dog.  Well those nice rooms are not pet friendly -- totally makes sense because it was super nice.  \n\nThe pet friendly rooms -- ahh I see where the negative reviews come in now.  They are a bit run down.  Lots and lots of folks \"live\" here with their pets because of the house burned down or in between homes.  \n\nFree hot breakfast every morning.  And every M,T, W they have some type of hot dinner or desert.  \n\nThey have an outdoor pool and basketball court.  They have bbq grills, picnic tables, and open green spaces to have parties (lots of family reunions were held there too).  \n\nFolks are nice.  Cleaning crew in the pet-friendly rooms were not as good as the super nice rooms by the lobby.  \n\nYou can walk your dog in lots of safe places in the neighborhood nearby and the city hall grounds nearby.  The city hall has a water fountain splash park for kids.  On Saturdays, there is a farmer's market, all within a 5 minute walk.  \n\nIf you are staying for more than 8 days, their pet fee is cheaper than the other extended stay hotels in the area.  They have a one-time fee, compared to the other ones that are weekly.  \n\nThe only negative really did upset me.  I did not notice until I was doing my taxes months after I checked out:  the local phone calls are NOT free.  The sign said it was free.  I was charged over $25 for a few calls to my new workplace -- same area code, and making toll free phone calls to set up utilities for my home.    \n\nBecause of the d\u00e9cor of the pet rooms plus this little rip off on the phone, I downgraded my score.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "RI_WARREN_GM, General Manager at Residence Inn Detroit Warren, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you, Tarainjag, for taking the time to share your experience at our location, we appreciate it.
