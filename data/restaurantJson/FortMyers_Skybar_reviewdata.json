Perched atop the Firestone Grill Complex which includes the Martini Bar, the SkyBar offers the best riverfront view available in the area. I prefer the late afternoon hours where I can appreciate the unique view, the sunset and the natural ambiance of good friends, good food and well prepared drinks. Be advised I'm prejudiced. I've come to know the staff well as they have always taken good care of me. The happy hour specials are well thought out in both the drink and appetizer venues. The servers and bar staff provide each customer with the thought that they are there only to provide for them. Later in the evening the crowd changes. One can experience a touch of South Beach until the wee weekend hours. Bottle tables and service are usually available. Music by recognized DJs appear to be appreciated by the wall to wall crowd. A crowd that is well behaved as security provided by the management keeps a lid on the party. I've never had a bad experience other than the time they ran out of Grey Goose. Many locals never try the SkyBar as they believe it to be a tourist trap affair. How wrong they are. It's a Gem on the Riverfront.
