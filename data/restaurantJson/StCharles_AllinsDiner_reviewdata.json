We chose to sit out on the patio. Very old but cute. Our waitress assured us after we told her it was our first time that we would really enjoy it. She said the breakfast food is really good. We were not disappointed we enjoyed our visit there as well as the food. That's not like you were with family having breakfast in granny's backyard. Will definitely go again if in the area would recommend.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-26T04:35:43-0400", "location_id": "3530114", "id": "292573961", "user": {"username": "chebra57", "user_location": {"name": "Arnold, Missouri", "id": "29661"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Great breakfast", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44876-d3530114-r273089169-m11068-Allin_s_Diner-Saint_Charles_Missouri.html#review273089169", "text": "This is my family's favorite local diner. It's tiny, but we have always managed to secure a table (although sometimes we've gotten the last one available!). It is a bit pricier than most diner fare, but we willingly pay the little extra. The food is outstanding - the best diner pancakes I've ever had. Service is generally pretty good, but sometimes during busy times the wait staff gets overwhelmed and can be short or less attentive. Normally they are good, however, and the food is cooked and at the table in minutes. Highly recommended!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-05-19T11:58:52-0400", "location_id": "3530114", "id": "273089169", "user": {"username": "heder", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "No lunch forme!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44876-d3530114-r267934425-m11068-Allin_s_Diner-Saint_Charles_Missouri.html#review267934425", "text": "My husband and I went in about 1:15 pm for a cheeseburger and chili dog.

Maybe just a very bad cook. At 2:02 we put $10 on the table and left.

Had the full house special omelet which was a 6 egg omelet with andouille and sharp cheddar.  From ordering to being served food approximately 5 minutes to a hot, fresh, fluffy omelet!  They did NOT skimp on the meat or cheese which was great!  I also love that they have real cheese not just american.   Friendly and attentive waitress.  I visited at 7 am on a Sunday so not super busy at the time, in a strip mall with lots of parking.  It is a small ish place so may get hopping and have some waiting not sure.
