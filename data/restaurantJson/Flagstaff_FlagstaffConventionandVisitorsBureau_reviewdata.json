These types of places are hit or miss when traveling. You either get a little old lady (sorry) sitting there not being helpful or you get a place like this. They were fully staffed with several people to answer the most quirky of questions from tourists. The two men who helped us were just outstanding. You first got the standard formal answers to our questions and then they would tell you what they thought of each place we wanted to visit, when to get there, what to avoid and what to make sure we seen. If we could have adopted one of them for our trip we would have.  If you plan on visiting the many Federal and state parks in the area the one key question to ask the staff are about the fee's to get into the park's. Not as easy as it sounds. They will walk you through how to combine passes and save the most money on the entrance fee's while maximizing your experiences. This place will give you information not found on any website. Plenty of brochures, maps and souvenirs to purchase as well. It's also in the downtown area of old Flagstaff so plenty of restaurants and shops to go visit after you are done there.
