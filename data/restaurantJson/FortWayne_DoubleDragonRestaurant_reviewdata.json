You place your order with what I presume to be the son of the owners who are feverishly working in the back to produce these fine meals.  He is always happy to help and very efficient in taking orders which are never messed up.  I always order my personal favorite of the General Tso Chicken (extra spicy) with Hot & Sour soup.  The portion size is enough to fill the biggest appetites!  The meal just seems to disappear even though I know the amount of food I am consuming is not healthy to eat in such a short period of time.  I finish off with a fortune cookie and leave happier than ever.  Double Dragon (aka Double D's) is by far the best chinese restaurant I have been too.
