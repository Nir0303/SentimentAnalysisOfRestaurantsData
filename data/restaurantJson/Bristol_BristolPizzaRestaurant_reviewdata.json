Don't get me wrong the food is good but not worth it to me. I arrive at the started time to pick up my pizzas when there card reader is having issues. It was not reading cards with security chips.  No big deal. They start trying to fix it.  A customer suggests entering the card number like a phone order and they say it's one button and they can't. First problem because they have the same machine I have at work just because they don't know how to use it they start making people leave to go to an atm and come back to get their food.  I only brought a credit card, license and phone so I had to drive all the way home them get cash to go back.  Once back it is now at least half am hour past my food being done so I ask if they are going to do anything for my inconvenience and more my certainly child food which is on oddly not my fault.  The poor cashier meekly apologized before 3 managers come and start in telling me off that it's not their fault about the credit machine (which is true and wasnt my real issue) and continued ranting about how \"I'm causing a problem and I am free to go to any place else I want and they couldn't care.\" For a restaurant in a town that there are 3 other pizza places you can see from their parking lot you would think they'd at least attempt to be nice.  A simple apology would have sufficed instead of being told off and talked over until I walked out before saying something I would regret. Completely rude. Terrible customer service skills.
