SO GLAD WE DID! My husband and I do not get the opportunity very often to stretch our palates; we are simple eaters.  But we certainly enjoyed ourselves here.  The cheese beer bread, braised pork cheeks, and the pig head Banh mi were delicious.  Didn't care very much for the smoked chicken wings; too chewy for public dining. :)  The plates are small but I like that since it gives you more room to try different items. Yes, I recommend highly at least visiting when you feel adventurous. And DEFINITELY when you have tix for the National! The \"back stairs\" access is worth it BUT not handicapped friendly (one long, winding, narrow flight of stairs).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Peter W, Owner at Vagabond, responded to this review", "text": "Thanks for the review!

Tried almost every cocktail and have to say that only the bourbon special and the airmail classic were to my palate, but perhaps next time we'll do a wine instead. I'm not sure about the other mid plates, but the one we had wasn't noticeably much bigger than the smalls ... I think it's just a price break that they chose to split some off because of higher cost/time/ingredients, so consider that before you think you could order a mid plate salad and call that dinner ... definitely will need something more, no matter how small an eater!
