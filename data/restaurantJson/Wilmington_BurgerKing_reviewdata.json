The smell alone was enough to turn me away but a walk to the bathroom almost caused a fall because of the grease on the floor, and it appeared to have been accumulated for quite some time! The bathroom was unbelievable as well, extremely dirty and run down. This place should probably be demolished and I won't stop here again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-15T16:32:02-0400", "location_id": "4246418", "id": "373204764", "user": {"username": "Rick A", "user_location": {"name": "Bolivia, North Carolina", "id": "48970"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "vacation", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49673-d4246418-r365799957-m11068-Burger_King-Wilmington_North_Carolina.html#review365799957", "text": "Saved the night for us.
