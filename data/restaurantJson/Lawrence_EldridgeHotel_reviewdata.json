Room 203 is a bit, but not much better.  \n\nMy stay: \nI stayed, for business, on a weeknight and originally got the dreaded room 210.  On check-in, the nice desk clerk apologized for the room ('there's no view and it has some problems... But it has a little bar; so it's kind of cute'). There was no other room available. Unfortunately, the 'bar' in the room is fairly pointless. There are no minibars in this hotel.  It is just an empty sort of shelf-thing.  At 1 AM, unable to sleep with the air conditioner chugging and roaring next to me, I called the front desk to see if there was another room.  The very nice desk clerk offered room 203 and I gathered my stuff and moved down the hall.  \n\nRoom 203 has an air conditioner that is almost as bad.  It is as loud, but at least 7 feet from the bed.  If 210 sounds like a lawnmower, this one sounds like a struggling vacuum cleaner.   Every time the fan turns on/off the unit shakes, squeals, hisses and would wake up anyone not in an actual coma.   \n\nMy colleague stayed in room 206 (?) and texted me at 2:30 AM: 'The air conditioner is too loud to sleep.  No sleep tonight. I'm canceling morning meeting and heading home early. ' \n\nThe hotel has some charm. The really loud air conditioners remove any charm. \n\nThere are ' soundmachines' in both rooms with a card that reads ' for your added comfort, we have provided sound machines to ensure you have a relaxing and restful night's sleep' Room 210 also has industrial foam earplugs on the nightstand.  This suggests that the hotel knows these rooms are loud and still rent them. This is deceptive and, frankly, rudely inhospitable. If the room is loud, the right thing to do is warn potential guests before booking the room. Even better, the hotel should invest in the property and fix the problem before a guests must suffer sleepless nights.  \n\nI would strongly recommend not staying here if sleep is important to your enjoying your visit to Lawrence.  If you must stay here, find a room where the air conditioner is in part of the suite where a door can be closed between the bed and the air conditioner unit.  I think there are a few such rooms in the building.  \n\nLast point: the restaurant.  On a previous stay for business (thankfully, no a/c needed that night), I ordered the fish special.  It was truly disgusting- greasy, over cooked, and tasted like salt (my colleague accurately said it tasted like old popcorn). I sent it back. The waiter tried to take it off my bill but came back to the table and said apologetically that he was 'sorry, I'm not able to remove the charge'.  It was a business lunch with a client, so I shrugged it off. But, this was really odd for a reasonably nice hotel.   \n\nThe place needs work/ management attention before I'll stay again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Lisa K, Public Relations Manager at Eldridge Hotel, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for your review of your stay on a recent business trip to Lawrence, Kansas. Many guests agree with you about The Eldridge Hotel\u2019s charm and the friendly front desk staff. All management have read your review, and we are very sorry that your experience in your sleeping room led to lack of sleep. We\u2019ve invested in our rooms to ensure guests receive a comfortable night\u2019s rest (new bedding, beds, white noise machines, adjusting A/C units etc). The vibrant Downtown Lawrence nightlife is the reason the sound machines and earplugs are provided. We apologize you had to move rooms during your stay, and because of the occupancy of the hotel that night, the choices were slim where to move you. The A/C unit in the rooms that you mentioned have been checked and improved so this doesn\u2019t happen to future guests. We know this doesn\u2019t change your lodging experience. Please consider our apology and the updates we have made as you make your lodging decisions for your next trip to Lawrence. We would love to have you back to our historic property so that we may improve your opinion. As for your memory of a previous stay when you ate at our restaurant, apologies on our end are in order there too. Our kitchen strives to create excellent flavors and use fresh ingredients all under the guidance of our skilled chefs. We care deeply about customer satisfaction with our food and beverage. We do have policies for dishes that are rated unsatisfactory. If you sent your dish virtually untouched back to the kitchen, a discount should have been applied. We have reviewed the \u201ccomped meals\u201d policy with all staff. We have updated our menus as of Sept. 1 and have brought in a new food & beverage director. We hope you\u2019ll come back. The next time you visit The Eldridge Hotel or TEN restaurant, please ask for Ashley, our Food & Beverage Director, who would be happy to discuss more in person and help make this right.
