Spotlessly clean exerior, a speaker system that works and a line of cars coninually moving, good things might be in store. A relatively large menu for such a small place, I opted for bean tostada and crunchy beef taco. Neither disappointed. The tostada was warm and crispy, slathered in a rich refried bean mixture that gave a nice contrast to the crunch of the corn tortilla. A required layer of shredded iceberg, and the most cheese I can recall seeing.The taco meat was moist, flavorful hot, just great. Again the required toppings, heavy on lactose! You are asked at the speaker if you want hot sauce, and they is a little in your bag if you answer yes. Not store made, no chunks, a non-descript red sauce that leaves one looking for the \"hot\". This is fast food at its finest, if such a thing exists. If you are wanting \"Mexican\" food, not really cooked but prepared and topped, lightening fast frendly service stop by.
