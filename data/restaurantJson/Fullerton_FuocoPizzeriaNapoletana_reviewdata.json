I have to say it is the best pizza I've ever had in the U.S. I have been to Italy a few times and the best pizza, of course, was in Naples. This pizza tasted exactly the same as if I were back in Naples. I ordered the margherita pizza. Loved seeing them make it and baking it in the firewood ovens. The crust was super thin, the cheese was so good and not too heavy and the tomato sauce was delicious. I went with my husband and two daughters and it was so good that we each finished a whole pizza by ourselves and even shared an incredible Nutella pizza for dessert. I highly recommend it. Not only was the food good but the staff was very friendly. I will be dreaming of coming back very soon. Keep doing what your doing!
