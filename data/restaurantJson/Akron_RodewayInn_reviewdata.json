He took a few minutes to return with nobody else there, so he wasn't taking care of another guest. Then, after spending several minutes going between the computer and some papers, he said he had to start the whole process again. It took at least 10-15 minutes to get checked in. As if that wasn't bad enough, we arrived at 12:15am after a long drive from St. Louis.\n\nBut all of this wasn't even the worst of it. At 4 a.m. we had someone walk in our room. He turned on the light and walked right in. I sat up in bed and asked why he was there. He just said \"oops, wrong room\" and left. No apology or explanation, and he left the light on. He did say he was from the front desk or I would have called the police, which I should have done anyway. I only chose not to because we had to be up 2 hours after that and I needed sleep.\n\nI am beyond disappointed in this experience. The only good thing about the stay was the free weekend parking.

With more than a dozen floors, only one was being used for guests during my most recent stay.  The management has changed each of those 3 years.  Air conditioning was kept off in the halls and rooms until you took occupancy.  Halls and rooms were in the 80's or 90;s.  Of the five rooms rented, 2 had to be reassigned due to weak or non-functioning AC.  The AC in my room went out somewhere between 2:30 and 4:00 A.M. and my security latch on the door was not working.  I packed up and went down to the lobby for the duration of the evening.

Probably a 2-3. Went on saturday in august. Lobby, hot and dark. Pool, closed. Two people at desk, very nice. Parking garage, desolate. But, none of that is horrible, just not 5 star. So, first room, not so hot. I don't think anyone actually stayed in it for months. 14th floor. Toilet had brown water, and wierd little bugs. Flushed it, still brown. Bath, same thing, gross brown water. So, we asked for another room. Finally got one after about 20 min, not horrible wait, but still. Second room was great (12th fl), if we didn't see the first it would have been awesome. But, this was good, air conditioner worked, bath and toilet was clean. Bed worked, tv was old but worked. Worth 90 bucks, no, but was in walking distance of Lock 3 where we wanted to go for hamburger Festival. For one night it was fine. Only hotel in town, so if you are visiting for the theater or the Rubber Ducks baseball game, a good place. Just don't expect 5 star and ask for a newer room. Oh, last thing, they only use a few floors, stopped at 5th and it was pitch black. Not as bad as everyone is saying, not that the are lying, but we had an ok experience.

Wish I'd have read some of these reviews before deciding to stay at this place.  The only positive aspect was the location because we could walk to the Akron Civic Theater for our concert.  First we had a horrible time finding this place.  We finally find it & get parked & head into the lobby.  It was 90 & humid out & there was absolutely no air conditioning in the lobby or any of the hallways or elevators.  The girl at the front desk had about 6 fans going.  There was a couple in front of us checking in & by the time we got checked in & headed to the elevator they were back...the room they were given was already occupied by someone else!  I cringed as we got into the dark elevator to head up to our room.  What a dump!  Sleep number beds didn't work, mold on the bathroom ceiling, plugged sink, someone's fingernail clippers left between the bed & nightstand along with a room key, air conditioning in the room barely worked, some sort of hairball on the floor outside the bathroom, no remote to be found for the 1987 tv & the list goes on & on!  They advertise a pool & a restaurant/bar.  The pool was closed for maintenance (I'm assuming it's prob been years since they had a pool) & we never encountered the restaurant/bar being open.  I didn't get to sleep till almost 3am & by 6:30am I was up & ready to head home!  We got no bill under our door so we called down to say we were leaving.  She said if we didn't receive a bill we had to come down to the front desk.  The check out process took over 45 minutes.  There were 2 people in front of us & 4 or 5 behind.  Everyone seemed pretty disgusted by the whole ordeal.  I've never in my life paid that much to stay somewhere so crappy!  It wasn't worth more than $49.99 a night in my opinion!!!  As we were all struggling through the checking out another hotel employee showed up & thought it was hilarious we were all standing around sweating to death as we waited to leave.  He even joked about them only having one computer that worked.  THIS PLACE WAS A COMPLETE DUMP - I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING OUTSIDE OF THE CITY & JUST DRIVING IN FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE THERE FOR!

Stood in the front lobby for ten minutes waiting to check-in. I should have walked out and never looked back! The girl at the front desk finally showed up, out of breath and sweaty, apologizing and saying she had to go to the bank before it closed which is why she wasn't there. \nEverything was dated, creepy, dirty. The room had a old TV, no DVD player, no channel guide and the remote didn't work. When I called to find out about moving rooms, the line just rang until it disconnected me. I called 3 times with no luck of talking to someone. \nThe jacuzzi was filthy, covered in hair, nail polish streaks (gross) and God knows what else. When I got the surface cleaned, I turned the jets on and black \"stuff\" shot out everywhere. \nThe pillows smelled like sweat. The door didn't have a bolt lock. We only had 3 towels. Every other floor in the hotel was shut down, no lights, no electricity. Had to go on an adventure to find ice and had more luck passing rooms that stuck up the hall with marijuana smoke. The stairwells stunk of smoke and there were snuffed out cigarettes on the ground.\nIf I could have gotten the staff to answer the phone, I would have demanded a refund and left, although it seems I wouldn't have been successful from reading these other reviews; on a side note, I realize I should have read these reviews before subjecting myself to the terror of staying at this run down ghetto hotel.
