My grandmother needs a walker, and my kid a highchair (for the carseat). The staff here catered to our every need without hesitation. Our waiter, Josh, was amazing. Knowledgeable, helpful, and so nice! \n\nAnd the food. I'm not usually a pizza person. I enjoy a good pizza, but not often. We started with the fried mozzarella. Obviously fresh mozzarella, and a crispy, Panko breadcrumb coating. Very good. \n\n Main course: We had the downtown supreme pizza (without zucchini because my husband and grandma don't like zucchini). First, there was plenty for the three of us. It would have fed four - 2 slices per person. The crust was flavorful and not greasy. The toppings were delicious, and there was so much awesome cheese....\n\nDessert: You can't end a good cheat meal without sampling some dessert. We tried the cannoli and the lemon berry marscapone cake. The cannoli was super sweet, but the crust had a spice to it. The lemon cake was a great blend of tart, sweet, and creamy-richness with some powdered sugar on top. These desserts were almost too rich for me, but they were so so so good. Definitely worth trying, and if your sweet tooth can't keep up, there was enough to share with others for sure.\n\nThe atmosphere was spacious while still feeling like a cozy place to eat. Good, relaxing music (a healthy assortment of Jimmy Buffet), and the beautiful brick oven was right there for everyone to see. \n\nOverall, this was a treat for all. I will definitely be coming back!
