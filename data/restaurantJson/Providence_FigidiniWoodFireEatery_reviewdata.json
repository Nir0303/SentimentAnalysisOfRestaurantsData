My four slice speciality  personal pizza was $18.\n\nThe experience was unique.  A very busy lunchtime and somehow our order must have been misplaced.  After 30 minutes, we asked how much longer; the waitress told it would be soon.  10 minutes later saw the three women sitting at the bar receive their order; they were seated after our order was taking by the waitress.  So checked with waitress again - she went to the chef and came back to tell us 5 more minutes.\n\nWe waited another 20 minutes and saw another group, who were seated after our order had been taken, receive their pizza.  Nearly an hour had passed,  we told the waitress to cancel the order and refund the payment. (The service was so slow, I paid by credit card before receiving the order so that we wouldn't be delayed returning to our meeting).\n\nShe went back to the chef and I could see they were both upset. (It turned out the chef is the owner).  She came back and said the pizza was about to go in.  At this point we were out of time and patience.  I walked back with her to be clear to the chef we did not want the pizza and wanted a refund.  He had just laid out the dough for our two pizzas. \n\nI was amazed at his anger over a basic request to cancel an order for a two pizzas that had not been made and my request for refund.

I ignored him, with no comment at all.\n\nMy colleague and I left the restaurant to try to find a quick takeout to return to our meeting.  The owner, to his credit, ran down the street to give us the two pizzas we had ordered - he did so without payment. \n\nThe pizza was excellent,  his ultimate response was what I would expect,  or at least some version like a significant discount.

It was hot out and we were thirsty and asked for a glass of ice to add to our water.  To our surprise, during the meal our waitress refilled our ice glass with fresh ice.  Overall, a great dining experience.  The historic downtown is an interesting place to stroll around.

Pricey too!!! $70 for 2 small pizzas and a salad.  A waste of calories and money!

Your description was not a mistake because Neapolitan pizza is known for being a \"wet/soggy\" pie.  I've attached a link that describes what to expect when visiting a Neapolitan pizzeria.  You mentioned you are from New Haven which leads me to believe you are familiar with Coal Fired pizza which is a totally different beast.  As for our ingredients EVERYTHING is either imported from Italy and/or Spain to make our pie.  The mozzarella di Bufala which is on our Margherita extra comes from the Water Buffalo (imported from Campania).  It contains much more moisture than regular mozzarella so combined with the crushed DOP San Marzano tomatoes it creates a pizza that needs to be eaten with a knife and fork.  Our flour, Caputo 00, is also imported from Italy and is milled twice.  This dough is very different from American style because there is NO sugar and oil added to it making it much lighter.  Many of our regulars and/or visitors that have traveled to Naples, Italy tell us all the time that we have created a pizza that reflects complete authenticity to what you would find in Naples.  This may be the reason for us having so many great reviews.  We are a small independent restaurant that is completely dedicated to providing our customers with a lovely dining experience but mostly to showcase the product that we love the most, Neapolitan pizza.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions on what style of pizza they like the best and certainly it seems that this style isn't for your liking but I wanted you to know that what you were served was not a mistake just a different style that you are not used to.  We hope this message finds you well.   http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/08/what-to-expect-at-a-neapolitan-pizzeria.html", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-06-06T14:31:59-0400", "id": "380397251"}, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-04T16:38:45-0400", "location_id": "4460380", "id": "379783369", "user": {"username": "J3944", "user_location": {"name": "Branford, Connecticut", "id": "33725"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Great Service, Ok Food, Good Vibe", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60946-d4460380-r378444458-m11068-Figidini_Wood_Fire_Eatery-Providence_Rhode_Island.html#review378444458", "text": "Came in with my two kids for a quick bite to eat.  My daughter loves pizza and thought she would enjoy it.  She didn't think the pizza was good.  It was too floppy for her taste and my son wouldn't even try it, but he is super picky.  I got a couple of the tapas and they were yummy, the saganaki cheese was good ( bit salty) but very tasty and so was the steak.  Waiter never asked how I wanted it prepared and it came out rare.  So I sent it back and he had it cooked medium for me.  Very small menu with not a lot of options.  The atmosphere was really nice and lots of beverage options at the bar.  Nice spot just not right for my family and I.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-05-31T15:31:20-0400", "location_id": "4460380", "id": "378444458", "user": {"username": "Cleow2013", "user_location": {"name": "Barrington, Rhode Island", "id": "54060"}}}]}
