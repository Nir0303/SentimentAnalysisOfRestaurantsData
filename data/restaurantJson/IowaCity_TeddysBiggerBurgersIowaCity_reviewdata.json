There are also chicken options that are excellent, as well as salads for the lighter eaters.

The burgers are juicy, the milkshakes are fabulous and the staff is so friendly! I love the hawaiian style burger, add jalape\u00f1os with a pineapple milkshake, heaven!! The only drawback is that it is a bit pricey but the quality of food is worth it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-03-02T17:05:01-0500", "location_id": "5420659", "id": "195953455", "user": {"username": "Exxie", "user_location": {"name": "Iowa", "id": "28936"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "No!

This had to be one of the worst burgers I have ever eaten. I've had school lunch burgers that were better! I love burgers, and when I saw the sign I was drawn to the cheesy juicy looking burger. But when I took the first bite I was grossly underwhelmed by the flavors, and by the second bite I was done - something was \"off\" and I threw it away because it was gross. This was a charbroiled messy disaster! Not to mention I ordered garlic fries and it was okay - but the grease from the fries soaked into the bottom of the burger bun creating a nasty mess. I ended up wasting money on that and had to buy something else. And for the other reviewer who said this was like 5 Guys : This is nothing like 5 Guys - 5 Guys is amazing!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-02-20T08:45:36-0500", "location_id": "5420659", "id": "194754788", "user": {"username": "CC-ELL", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
