Still the same good food.  Miss Sue was there when my class met for lunch.  She's as sweet and friendly as ever.  Sean was behind the counter serving up the best BBQ in town.  I had the ribs, a departure from my usual chopped beef sandwiches.  Loved it back in the 1960's and love it now.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-12-11T08:45:39-0500", "location_id": "410860", "id": "244040986", "user": {"username": "1964Bearkat", "user_location": {"name": "Plainview, New York", "id": "48407"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "A HAVE TO Stop in Bossier", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40044-d410860-r243928668-m11068-Joe_Cobb_Bossier_Bar_B_Q-Bossier_City_Louisiana.html#review243928668", "text": "Nestled in the middle of Bossier City LA is a GEM that should be discovered by all. \n\nOver 50 years ago a young man by the name of Joe Cobb made a deal with a family member to open a small Bar B Que shop, and he had a dream. \n\nSince the 1950's, Cobb's Bossier City Bar-B-Q has been opened for business at 203 McCormick Street off of Barksdale Boulevard in Bossier City LA and I am here to tell you, the ONLY thing that has changed is the fact that the cost of eating has gone up a little since you could buy 5 for a Dollar.\n\nThis small business with the big heart and bigger taste has been a family owed business since day 1 and what comes with that is something that you cannot get from the big chain stores: REAL down home cooking and true Customer Service. \n\nInside the doors of this small venue, that pretty much has been kept looking exactly like it was fifty years ago, is some of the finest Bar-B-Q in the state of Louisiana if not the entire country. \n\nStill made the way it was back then and with no hoopla or frills, this jewel has been serving generations of locals and lucky travelers such as myself great food at great prices still today. \n\nFrom the beautiful pictures of Joe and his wife that hang on the wall to the many other classic articles and pictures on the walls and then watching your sliced beef or ham actually get sliced right in front of you while you wait, is a great feel and taste. \n\nIf you happen to wander into Bossier and cannot find this small venue hidden away from the hustle and bustle of the city around it, just ask anyone where it is. Good luck and good eats are in your future here", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-12-10T12:59:38-0500", "location_id": "410860", "id": "243928668", "user": {"username": "EZMARK", "user_location": {"name": "Dalls TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Old Fashioned B-B-Q", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40044-d410860-r243912447-m11068-Joe_Cobb_Bossier_Bar_B_Q-Bossier_City_Louisiana.html#review243912447", "text": "Wishing a sandwich for lunch we did not want cold cuts deli style.
