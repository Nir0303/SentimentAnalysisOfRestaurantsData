The staff is friendly, socializing rampant, amazing ambiance, and the list goes on and on.  I have traveled a lot and search our cigar lounges.  Burn is in my top favorites!\n\nI enjoy cigars, and smoke them now and then.  A few years back I turned to pipes.  Bought a nice estate briar, and enjoy English blends.  I can smoke high quality tobacco for months on the same amount as one decent cigar.\n\nRecently I visited Burn, purchased a $10 cigar since I believe in supporting a place I love.  I puffed a few minutes and reverted to my pipe.  After a few more minutes an employee noticed me and informed me of a new law prohibiting the smoking of my pipe.  He said there was a \"paraphernalia law\" aimed at shutting down hookah lounges, but it encompassed pipe smoking at Burn.  As a honest team player, I put my pipe away and continued on my cigar.\n\nIt's frustrating to say the least, that this law exists.  While I'm sure the affluent population in Burnsville, MN would love nothing but to rid the city of hookah lounges, this law has prohibited a good, law abiding citizen from smoking a legal briar with respectable tobacco.  While I suspect the issue has more to do with concerns over marijuana, I am disappointed that this could happen.  After all, Burn is the place where you go to legally smoke tobacco indoors.  I'm sure Burn doesn't want to loose on sales and doesn't support loitering which is why my first order of business was to buy a $10 cigar (of which much of my money goes to taxes in the city of Burnsville).\n\nI wouldn't expect this law to be reversed, and assume in the future laws will even be passed which ban places like Burn all together, which would be a great loss.\n\nIn writing this, my purpose is to voice a perspective from the other side of the fence to show that laws like this take away rights as well.\n\nI guess I'll continue smoking my briar elsewhere, and continue stI can smoke high quality tobacco for months on the same amount as one decent cigar.\n\nRecently I visited Burn, purchased a $10 cigar since I believe in supporting a place I love.
