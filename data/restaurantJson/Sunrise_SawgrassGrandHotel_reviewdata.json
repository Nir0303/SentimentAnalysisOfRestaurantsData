Apparently they find it appropriate to charge someone a $250.00 smoking fee out of the blue, for no reason, and have no real explanation why they did so. Luckily, I found the charge on my bank statement, because otherwise there was no warning that it was coming, there was no call or email or anything saying that they were charging me. there was just a random $250.00 charge that popped up.\nI was proactive in this matter and immediately called them up, had them explain, and asked to speak with a manager as this was impossible and needed to be rectified. I was given Mr. Spence's phone number and email and I contacted him through both. I called for 3 straight days, left several voicemails, and never heard back. Finally, I wound up in the area again, and stopped by the hotel to discuss this further. There was NO manager on duty, and the place was an absolute mess. It was a circus with no ringleader. Finally, I was able to speak with someone and he assured me that Mr. Spence would be contacted by him personally and I would hear back. Of course, nothing, so I called again...nothing. Several days went by and I filed a dispute with my credit card company. magically I received a short email from Mr. Spence that was in broken English addressing nothing that I had said and repeating that I had a smoking charge etc.\nLet me be extremely clear here...I AM NOT A SMOKER, I HAVE NEVER BEEN A SMOKER, and I most certainly would never smoke indoors even if I happened one. I would love to know how my room was apparently so full of smoke, that they had to deep clean it over the course of several days. Umm...what? How is that even possible? Did one of your employees take a smoke break in my room after I checked out at 7 am? Did you take a smoke break in there Mr. Spence? Or is this one of you and your hotel's shady practices just to screw customers out of money? Honestly, none of the above would surprise me at this point.\nI travel for a living, and stay in approximately 40 different hotels per year, and I have NEVER, EVER ran into something like this. Not only do they attempt to scam me out of this money, but the manner in which they have handled the situation (mostly ignored it), and simply acting as if they can do whatever they want is as off-putting as I have ever experienced from a business.\nI would never stay here again. The lack of organization, leadership, competence, and human decency is incredibly appalling, and it's a shame. Hopefully one day enough 1-star reviews and their F rating from the Better Business Bureau will actually mean something to them enough to make positive changes. Until then, avoid this property at all costs.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-11-14T18:39:34-0500", "location_id": "85814", "id": "437279977", "user": {"username": "HoosBruce", "user_location": {"name": "Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida", "id": "34573"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Sawgrass grand hotel", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34667-d85814-r436957630-m11068-Sawgrass_Grand_Hotel-Sunrise_Broward_County_Florida.html#review436957630", "text": "This hotel was very pleasant, great employees excellent rooms, very clean, not to crowded the bar lacked options although Craig the bartender  definitely made it worth staying and drinking at the hotel.

Well I had the most amazing bartender who definitely made my stay very accommodating and made me feel right at home. I saw him almost every night his name was Craig I think. He was very nice and helped me with any questions I had about the area as well as just making some pleasant small talk. Always being on the road can really make you feel singled out and lonely. Only getting to see my family twice a year if lucky. Getting to talk to someone like Craig was almost refreshing he was very down to earth and easy to talk to. I really appreciated having someone make me feel so welcome when I was so far away from home. The whole staff was really great but he definitely made the stay even better.
