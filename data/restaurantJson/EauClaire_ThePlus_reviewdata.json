First of all, not a fan of the new name. I'm sure it's an attempt to sound cool and exclusive in the area, but now you have no idea what the business is and it will only attract locals, not people from outside the area. However, that might not be their biggest issue. \n\nOn two separate occasions in April, I visited The Plus. Once, during brunch and my friend and I were literally yelled at by two staff members for being in their way. The flow of their set up didn't allow room for standing anywhere else. \n\nWhen leaving the ladies room, there is a swinging door from the kitchen that staff members come flying through in a huge hurry. They yell, at the top of their lungs, \"door!\" But don't even wait a millisecond before flying through it. It just feels like a disaster waiting to happen, and no customer should have to deal with this. Also, the ladies room smells horribly of urine. The smell is so bad it literally makes me gag. Positively disgusting. \n\nOn my second visit, this past Thursday evening around 9:30, I ordered a Guiness on tap from the bartender and he told me $5. I paid it thinking it was strange but didn't question it. About 40 minutes later, I ordered another and a drink for my friend (mich golden light) and it was a little over $5 for both. I'm not sure what happened here, but again didn't question it as I was out for a girls night and didn't want to deal with the drama over $3. \n\nLater in the evening, we needed to meet a friend outside who had never been to the plus and requested to leave our drinks with the bartender in the meantime. We had a strange guy who wouldn't leave us alone and were concerned with unattended drinks. The bartender (same one with the $5 discrepancy) looked at me and nastily said, \"you can leave your drink on your table or the rail, just like everyone else does.\" And went right back to what he was doing. \n\nAfter 2 bad experience in one month, I'm hesitant to go to The Plus anytime in the future. Things like my experiences should not ever happen regardless of the experience. Also, keeping your female patrons safe should be your #1 priority. It costs zero effort to put a drink behind the bar. I've never been more upset or disgusted with an establishment in my life after Thursday's debacle.
