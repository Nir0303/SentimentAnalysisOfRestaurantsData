My friend had an ultimate Burger.  \n\nThe French Onion soup missed the mark, too much bread and not enough flavor, but the Camembert Salad was excellent.  According to my friend the Burger was one of the best she has ever had.\n\nThe thing that knocked me over was the little French Market they have as part of the restaurant.  These people are serious about good European Cheese.  Lovingly displayed in a special cooling room.  OMG what they have in there will give any Gourmet Cheese lover, the chills.  The rest of the market was filled with all sorts of interesting French imports.   One more thing that made me sing Hallelujah, was they had fresh made French croissants frozen in packages so you can take them home and pop them in the oven,   Now if you ever had real French croissants, you will know what I mean when I say, we are lucky to have this new place in the heart of Marin", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-17T18:42:03-0400", "location_id": "10235777", "id": "373916281", "user": {"username": "fcoya", "user_location": {"name": "san francisco", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "All around great experience!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33037-d10235777-r366919794-m11068-Le_Comptoir-San_Rafael_Marin_County_California.html#review366919794", "text": "5.0 star rating 4/24/2016\nWOW!!! Marin County needed a place like this - contemporary, cool, sophisticated and downright welcoming and friendly all at the same time. And, lest I forget, the food and wine are amazing. We started with the beet salad and the ahi tuna. The multi-colored beets came out like a piece of modern art, but were not frou frou at all. Big chunks of beet with nuts and a light dressing drizzled on the plate. Yum. Tuna tartare was fresh with just enough heat from the wasabi aioli. I had the mussels and my partner had the pork tenderloin. Wow!!! I have to say, I enjoyed her dish even more than mine. Hers had a bed of cabbage with a DELICIOUS mustard sauce. Pork was medium rare and so juicy! As for the wine, I wish I could tell you what we drank. We let Stephan, the owner, just deliver his choices and they were all delicious. It's like he knew what we would like. We had a French champagne (I know that is redundant, but wanted to be clear) that he chose and described as \"super sexy\" and it was! We moved on to two different reds whose name we didn't know, but it didn't matter because they were delicious. We were so stuffed that after dinner, we did not have dessert, but Stephan delivered some port to us that was the perfect sweet ending to a fabulous dining experience. Service was friendly, prompt and attentive. And, all the diners were so chatty and happy! Looking around, the place was packed the entire evening with people waiting at the bar. Despite the crowd, it wasn't noisy and we could easily talk with each other or with our neighbors at the table next door, which we did throughout the night! Go!!!
