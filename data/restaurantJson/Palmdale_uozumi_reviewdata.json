Since this is still noted on this website, maybe they did move (hopefully) just a few doors up and nearer Palmdale Blvd. I will check again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-20T08:43:04-0400", "location_id": "3195303", "id": "394716867", "user": {"username": "William L", "user_location": {"name": "Palmdale, California", "id": "32848"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-03", "title": "New Location, New Name, Same Chefs, Same Menu", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32848-d3195303-r154190781-m11068-Uozumi-Palmdale_California.html#review154190781", "text": "Antelope Valley sushiites rejoice!

This is very good Sushi here in the Antelope Valley and yet a real feature of this place is its dessert menu.  It includes creme brulee, made just perfect and items like a banana fried using tempura batter that can also be prepared with pancake batter.\nThe sushi is fresh, the rolls are creative, and there are more than enough cooked items to bring along friends who don't know better than to think they don't like sushi - everyone likes good sushi.\nThe decor in Uozumi is also worth mentioning: it is simple and casual and there are televisions usually playing sports of some kind.  But there is also a beutifully and traditionally set-up Japanese tea room, partitioned off from the rest of the restaurant, where one can arrange to take a traditional, Japanese tea.\nWhen travelling to Uozumi, watch the building numbers on 6th Street East.  The restaurant obviously puts all of its resources into the food, leaving the outside of the building very unassuming with barely a sign to mark it.\nEasily this is in the top few sushi places in the Antelope Valley.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-12-13T10:59:07-0500", "location_id": "3195303", "id": "147392703", "user": {"username": "dmpdsc", "user_location": {"name": "AV, California", "id": null}}}]}
