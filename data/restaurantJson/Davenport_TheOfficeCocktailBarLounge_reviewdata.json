I found the young female bartender to be very friendly, greeted me promptly. Offered a couple suggestions on what I might try it, at my request. Settled on a drink that was made very well. There were several other customers sitting at the bar that she seemed to know and proceeded to introduce them to me. Which I thought was very friendly and fun. I would definitely go back again", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-31T14:12:42-0400", "location_id": "7108551", "id": "360483267", "user": {"username": "Kim S", "user_location": {"name": "Bettendorf", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Great place!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37816-d7108551-r347456943-m11068-The_Office_Cocktail_Bar_Lounge-Davenport_Iowa.html#review347456943", "text": "Great bar/lounge.
