I bought a drink for $11 added a $1 tip and signed off for the $12 total. But when I was talking to one of my friends once I got home, they told me to check my account balance because some clubs like to add what they want on your card instead of what you were actually charged. Sure enough, I saw the $11 charge plus an additional charge of $25 that was not supposed to be there. Excuse me but the last time I checked, when you sign for an amount, that's the amount the business is authorized to charge on your card, no more, no less. I will be calling them and demanding that extra $25 be refunded back to my card. Only use cash when you go out to places like this. I learned my lesson for sure.
