Their location is hard to beat, right in downtown New Braunfels, in one of the historic buildings on the roundabout, close to the river and San Antonio Street with all of its antique stores.\n\nIf you are in need of a quick lunch or some coffee, the Crosswalk Cafe is a very good option. And they also have free, fast wi-fi. Good place to spend a couple of hours killing time with a laptop! :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-12-29T09:07:13-0500", "location_id": "919732", "id": "122239686", "user": {"username": "ABitofaNomad", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2011-08", "title": "Fresh and tasty", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56350-d919732-r117995774-m11068-Crosswalk_Coffehouse_Cafe-New_Braunfels_Texas.html#review117995774", "text": "The menu had so many great, fresh sounding items it was hard to choose.
