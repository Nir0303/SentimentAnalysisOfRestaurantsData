Many items feature the shape of Indiana, or bordering states, the state flag, or other emblems of pride for our state and city. I purchased a couple of stickers that say Evansville River City, that look like the round center pieces of the Main Street archways. The store also has a lot of locally made, or locally designed, items. They had a nice variety of things available the day I was there. Sunshine Juice is located in the back of the store. I'll have to return another day and try their cold press juice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-20T11:51:40-0400", "location_id": "10159253", "id": "365741553", "user": {"username": "bibliophile81", "user_location": {"name": "Evansville, Indiana", "id": "37093"}}}]}
