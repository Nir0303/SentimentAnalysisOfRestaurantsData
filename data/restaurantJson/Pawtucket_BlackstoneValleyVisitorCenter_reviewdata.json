We've made changes to our listing to better reflect where parking and entrance to the visitor center is. We're sorry if that caused any confusion. \nWith regard to the drapes, you are correct that those are not normally there. Visiting us at almost any other time and you would see a large-scale timeline of Blackstone Valley's history from William Blackstone and Samuel Slater, to the growth in population and factories, and our current National Park and mill redevelopment. In addition to being a visitor center, the space is also used as a unique alternative event space and those drapes were put up during an event just the night before. We are going to make it a heightened point to make sure that doesn't happen again. \nThanks again, and hope to see you again around Blackstone Valley, Rhode Island's National Park.", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-05-23T10:20:27-0400", "id": "375861144"}, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-10T07:56:27-0400", "location_id": "531804", "id": "371790162", "user": {"username": "Saxeygirl", "user_location": {"name": "Salt Lake City, UT", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Great local visitor center", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54103-d531804-r330507576-m11068-Blackstone_Valley_Visitor_Center-Pawtucket_Rhode_Island.html#review330507576", "text": "The Blackstone Valley Visitor Center is a really nice facility that has good information about the sites, scenes and adventures offered in the Blackstone Valley.
