Didn't turn out so well.  \n\nI'm not a big seafood fan so order a safe dish, the fish tacos.  I could hardly find the 'fish' in my overly breaded overly cooked dish.  My husband's seafood burrito was cold in the middle.  The crab appetizer, which we thought might be like crab cakes (our fault for not asking specifically what it was) was crab legs swimming in a pool of butter. The shells were so soft the shell cracker didn't so much crack as crush spraying butter droplets everywhere, and handling the greasy legs was a trick in itself.  I think we ended up wasting about half of the expensive dish.   \n\nMaybe the place is very authentic but it wasn't too our liking.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-14T11:47:41-0400", "location_id": "5262445", "id": "265714859", "user": {"username": "Kristine P", "user_location": {"name": "Taylorsville, Utah", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-12", "title": "Great Mexican Seafood Restaurant in Salt Lake City, UT", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60922-d5262445-r186871780-m11068-Mariscos_Ensenada-Salt_Lake_City_Utah.html#review186871780", "text": "I enjoyed a delicious meal this evening at this little place.
