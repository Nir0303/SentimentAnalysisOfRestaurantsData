We go at least once a month. This is on the higher end for sushi in Orange County but so worth it. You get what you pay for! The crispy rice is my favorite. Best shishito peppers I've had. If you prefer the cooked route, the butter fish is amazing. If you have a big group, get the boat! Comes with enough food for an army and very reasonably priced, plus the presentation is great! Highly recommend to all!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-12-15T07:31:21-0500", "location_id": "1009985", "id": "333005778", "user": {"username": "Adam T", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Big Japanese Flavors in a Small Suburban Town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32590-d1009985-r321948112-m11068-Jizake-Laguna_Niguel_California.html#review321948112", "text": "Jizake brings the authentic flavors of Japan to this coastal community in a big way \u2014 everything on the menu is delicious!
