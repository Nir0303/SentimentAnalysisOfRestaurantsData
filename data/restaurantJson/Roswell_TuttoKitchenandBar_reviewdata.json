I called earlier in the day to make a reservation and the general manager answered and asked me if it was a special occasion. I mentioned my brother and I were taking my father out for a belated Father\u2019s day celebration and he said no problem, we\u2019ll have your table ready. When we walked in the door, he greeted us by name and had a Father\u2019s Day card waiting for us on the table that he had printed out and had the staff sign. It was such a kind gesture and made my dad feel very special. Our waitress was excellent, she is normally the bartender but told us she waits tables on Sundays and she recommended a really nice cabernet that we enjoyed. We started with the fried goat cheese and it was served over arugula with a honey drizzle. I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with fried goat cheese and this was excellent. I especially loved the arugula with honey, it was very tasty and I think with a touch of balsamic vinegar it would be perfect. We also shared the Beef short rib ragu over fontina polenta cakes. This was good but not great. It lacked a little flavor in my opinion, but everyone at the table seemed to enjoy it. I could not taste the fontina and the polenta seemed bland to me but I would give this another try.\nFor the main course two people in our party got the special of the day which was a salmon dish with farfalle pasta and a cream sauce. Both said they enjoyed the dish, it was a big portion and very rich but delicious. Can you go wrong with cream sauce? I think not. My dad got the Sausage and Pepper Fettuccini with bell peppers and onions. Two things to know about my dad besides the fact that he\u2019s awesome. He is an excellent chef and he always orders the cheapest thing when his kids take him out to eat even though we tell him not to and we want him to order what he wants. I guess it is a dad thing. Anyway, I could tell he didn\u2019t love it but that\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t delicious.  However, when my dad says \u201cI can make this better\u201d it\u2019s not a good sign. I said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you order something you can\u2019t make\u201d and his answer was \u201cI can make everything\u201d so I think you can see what we are dealing with here. \nMy brother ordered the lamb shank and he shrugged and said \u201cit\u2019s good.\u201d This is about all you are going to get out of my brother so I apologize for not elaborating but he\u2019s a man of few words. Last time I ate at tutto my husband ordered the lamb shank and he said it was delicious, moist, melt in your mouth good. So there you go.\nI got my favorite dish at any Italian restaurant which is the Fettuccine al Carbonara. Made with pancetta, egg, peas, parmigiana, onions, basil and olive oil. It was delicious! Perfect portion size so I didn\u2019t have to unbutton my pants afterwards and the flavors were exactly as they should be. If I could make this myself I would, but every time I try it never tastes as good as when I eat it out so now it is my go to dish. Last time I was at Tutto I also got this dish and it was as good, if not better this time so I know they are consistent.\nWe ended up getting another bottle of the delicious cabernet and that was going to be our dessert but the general manager brought out cannoli\u2019s for the table and a tiramisu for my dad. We were so impressed by their thoughtfulness and excellent service. I don\u2019t even like tiramisu but I liked this one. It was delicious. \nOverall, this is a great spot for lunch or dinner, the service is excellent and the food is good. Consistent and tasty. Could they improve on some things with the food? Sure, but the service is amazing and the everyone is so nice and welcoming I would go back even if the food wasn\u2019t good. Bottom line, great spot off the crowded and noisy hustle of Canton Street.

I give the chef credit for trying to pull off a twist on this classic Italian meal, but it just did not work for me.\n\nMy second meal was the Braised Colorado Veal Shank, which was covered with way too much sauce.\nBoth meals were edible, but nothing to run through the streets of Roswell, singing it's praises.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, and the bar well stocked, so with a little improvement in their meals,it could become quite an enjoyable joint to frequent.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-10T13:53:51-0500", "location_id": "7285399", "id": "346715548", "user": {"username": "Douglas N", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Potential for nice Roswell restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35235-d7285399-r344592685-m11068-Tutto_Kitchen_and_Bar-Roswell_Georgia.html#review344592685", "text": "I've been to Tutto Kitchen & Bar several times with my husband and for a girl's night out and have enjoyed the food.
