The two times I have been there, my order had been messed up twice. Realizing this young lady messed up the order (made my son's hamburger with everything on and not plain) and did not put all of the items into my bag (accusing me of already having them), I asked her to please remake all of the melting ice cream items because they would dirty up my brand new Jeep. We had already been waiting for the remade burger for 15 minutes at this point. She just stared at me with a glare without saying anything for at least 30 seconds. She told me my son never asked for his burger plain (with a nasty attitude) and called the cashier over. The cashier acknowledged that my son DID ask for it plain. The second time I called to have my order corrected (again she stated that I never asked for the burger plain), the same young woman stated that I never specified what I wanted (blatant lie). When we picked up our corrected hamburger, there was a 4-inch dark hair tucked into it. This was the item that my 9-year-old son bit into. I cannot speak on behalf of the behavior of the other employees (who seem to be really nice), but this young woman should not be working with food. I do not know this woman's name, but she is about 5'6, thin, dark hair, acne, overgrown eyebrows, and a really really combative attitude. \n\nPlease keep your family safe and steer clear of this place. If the woman I am speaking of feels that putting her hair into a hamburger is a dignified way of redeeming herself after making a mistake, then this is not a place you should feel safe taking your children to. \n\nPlease feel free to email me if you have any similar horror stories. I know several avenues we can take to handle this manner.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-07-30T19:17:42-0400", "location_id": "830582", "id": "218578118", "user": {"username": "CLCORDOVA81", "user_location": {"name": "Ventura, California", "id": "60769"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-08", "title": "Ice Cream on average", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60769-d830582-r138150209-m11068-Fosters_Freeze-Ventura_California.html#review138150209", "text": "Nothing bad to say here.
