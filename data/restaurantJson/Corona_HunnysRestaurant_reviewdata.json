I ate half of it for my lunch then ate the rest of it for breakfast the next day and it was still good :-)\n\nWith sandwiches, you have the option of soup, salad, fries, potato salad or fruit. Portions are good sized although I feel the prices are a touch on the high side.\n\nService was prompt and friendly and the seating is comfortable in an old-fashioned  neighbourhood cafe`style. \n\nWe'll go back :-)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-05-25T17:29:07-0400", "location_id": "878844", "id": "130606169", "user": {"username": "half-Brit", "user_location": {"name": "Oregon Coast", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "oso awful", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32248-d878844-r13187849-m11068-Hunny_s_Restaurant-Corona_California.html#review13187849", "text": "yikes......the tea and coffee tasted like they had an ashtray dumped in them.  the potatoes were cold and clammy.  the bacon was burnt.  the toast was stale. the service was non-chalant.
