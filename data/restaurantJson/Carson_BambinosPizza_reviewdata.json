I've been popping in there for a slice of pie for some time but it just occurred to me, fellow Trippers: let's share the joy if any of you are visiting our lovely beach area (well, about 5 miles from the beach but considering a lot of you have to fly or drive for hours just to see the ocean, it's a stone's throw!). Basically, the \"Bambo's\" (as it is affectionately known to us aging surfer-dude regulars) is a place you might see on \"Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives\". Located in a tiny (read TINY!!!) strip mall next to a liquor store and a few other nondescript businesses, I usually park across the street at the gas station and run in to get my slice(s).  First of all, at a buck a slice (and we're talking BIG slice), you can't go wrong. Secondly, if you are a fan of New Yawk-style thin crust pizza, this family owned & operated little jewel knows the closely guarded secret of the perfect ratio of expertly spiced sauce to cheese.  ROCKIN' !!!  Though I think there are only, like, two tables in the place they do a huge take-out and delivery business. The owner/maestro (sorry, kids, his name is currently swallowed in a JungleBoyJohnny brain-haze) was SO apologetic the other day when I popped in and the usually ready-to-go slices weren't ready yet.  \"Sorry, dude,\" he said in his not-so-slightly thick accent, \"We have a huge delivery order we are trying to get out!\".  \"Not a prob, Maestro.\", I said and chilled out.  15 minutes later I walked out with piping hot pieces of N'Yawky pie! They also do lasagna, sandwiches, and a large assortment of other Italian delectables but, and we're always honest here Trippers: I have not tried them.  But if you are in the vicinity and you crave a good slice... I dare you to find better.  And if you do, please let me know.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-04-10T21:58:10-0400", "location_id": "1005514", "id": "103562638", "user": {"username": "JungleBoyJohnny", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}]}
