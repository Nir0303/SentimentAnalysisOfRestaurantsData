The waitress seemed new/inexperienced, came and asked me if I wanted the short stack or the tall stack -- I reminded her that I had ordered French toast. The GF French toast was just Udi's store bread brushed with egg wash...not soaked through for that custard like quality and it was expensive. \nCountry fried red breakfast potatoes were outstanding! So, some light at the end of the tunnel. Very cute little place. With practice it could be excellent. \nRegarding the title above: I decided to get a pastry to go since the BF said his biscuit was very good, thinking that maybe the baked goods were the speciality. I chose the Mom's crumbcake accordingly. Sadly, it was dry, tasted like it had NO sugar, and even though it was purple as if there were berries, I didn't taste any fruit. Very disappointing. \nOh, and the bathroom is outside, so it would be inconvenient if it were raining or Wintertime.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-12T18:58:48-0400", "location_id": "10108158", "id": "417737148", "user": {"username": "Kocickasmom", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Gluten Free Biscuits and Gravy!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44737-d10108158-r392353185-m11068-Made_Today_Cafe-O_Fallon_Missouri.html#review392353185", "text": "Finally a place in St. Charles County that serves an amazing gluten free breakfast.  I have celiac, so it was great to be able to order biscuits and gravy (which I have missed). I ordered the full breakfast of eggs, hashbrowns, and bacon with it.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  The place is small, just a few tables, but it was cozy.  Everyone was friendly, and maybe the service was a little slow, but it didn't matter.  The breakfast more than made up for it.  They serve lunch too, but I haven't tried it.
