The sushi and sashimi are consistently good. We typically do take out but have eaten in the restaurant once. Only one time did we have a bad experience. We ordered on a Friday night at 6pm and when we got our order home the rolls were small and missing toppings. However, I would say that was outside of the normal experience. All of the other times the rolls are good sized and very tasty. We would like to see a few most \"spicy\" choices as a personal preference. But there are a nice variety. We do change up our order but typically always get the Aloha and Haya. Other ones we like include Las Vegas, Mazinger Z, Magic MT, Luna, Black Jack, Lucky 7, Red Hot and Satan's Blood. I know several people who like Blue Nami in Roseville. However, I would choose Haya any day over Blue Nami. They both tast good but Haya rolls are about twice the size of the ones at Blue Nami. A much better value.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-10-21T08:46:16-0400", "location_id": "8730947", "id": "320672423", "user": {"username": "tigereyes1970", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}]}
