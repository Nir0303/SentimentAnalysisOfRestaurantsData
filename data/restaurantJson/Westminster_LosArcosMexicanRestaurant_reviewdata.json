If you are looking for quality Mexican Food this is the place.  I have been eating here for 25 plus years and it seems to get better every time I visit.  First, They are Known for their Margarita's, Green Chili, Fajitas, and the Chili Rellenos!  I looked at some of the reviews here and was shocked by some of the negative reviews. The Green Chili is very flavorful and not too hot. It has a kick, but you can still feel your lips and face after eating it.  The chili rellenos are wrapped in an egg roll and then deep fried.  This is the best way to have them. Other Mexican restaurants dip them in an egg batter and fry them, but I prefer the egg roll deep fried style Los Arcos has.  \n\nThe restaurant is a family owned location and has been in Westminster for over 30 Plus years.  Yes, it's busy on the weekend's but honestly the longest my family of four has ever waited for a table was about 30-35 minutes to be seated on a weekend between the 6:00pm-7:30pm time slot.  Best time to go on the weekends would be at Lunch Time so around 11:00am-1:00pm or anytime before 5:00pm on the weekends if you want to avoid a wait. But trust me it's worth the wait.  Free homemade chips and homemade salsa at the table while you wait to order.  I don't eat red chili, but the green Chili is better than any other chili I have had in the state of Colorado. And I have eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants in Colorado. \nThey have a Mariachi band that plays on Friday Nights, and they are great.  \nThis is truly a Gem of a restaurant in the Westminster area, and I would Highly recommend this to any one who is looking for quality Mexican food.  \n\nAlso, despite some other post's, the prices for the meals are fair. Usually my wife and I and our two kids can eat dinner with soft drinks and tip typically for under thirty dollars.  \nTrust me when I say you will not be disappointed in the food quality or the restaurant atmosphere.  Do yourself a favor and eat there you will go back again, it's that good!\nThe only other two menu items I would 100% recommend is the Chili Cheese Fries, and the Fried Ice Cream. They are fantastic!\n\nFinal Note, this is a mid range style family restaurant and is very family friendly.  For non locals who are traveling, I would recommend coming here for dinner after your Visit to Water World as it's about a 10 Minute drive from Water World to Los Arcos Westminster.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-10T22:23:51-0400", "location_id": "381812", "id": "381528581", "user": {"username": "brian773", "user_location": {"name": "Denver, Colorado", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Excellent food!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33691-d381812-r376127808-m11068-Los_Arcos_Mexican_Restaurant-Westminster_Colorado.html#review376127808", "text": "Really enjoyed the food here, and the service was excellent.
