The foods are unique and delicious. My pork belly, lobster tail and 65 degree egg over bacon and cream gnocchi was incredible. My wife's pan fried Chilean sea bass and lemon risotto made me jealous that I didn't order that meal!\n\nBefore the meals, we enjoyed their bread service, with fresh rolls, olive oil and 25 year old balsamic vinegar, olive tapenade and roasted pepper hummus. That almost could be a meal in itself!\n\nIf you love food, go to Chefusion.
