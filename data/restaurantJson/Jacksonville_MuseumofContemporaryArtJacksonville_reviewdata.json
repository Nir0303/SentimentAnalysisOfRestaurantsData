What a joke.   The art looked like stuff you could find in a thrift store or a preschool class room.  If someone offered anything in this museum to me for free, I wouldn't take anything.  First floor was nothing but a restaurant (if you can call it that) and a gift shop which was disappointing like the rest of the place.   The second and third floor had thrift store quality art.  Can't believe they have to have security guards guarding this stuff.  I don't think they have to worry about anybody running off with the art.   They might have to worry about someone writing \"this art sucks\" on it though.  If you want to check this place out, go on the first full weekend of each month when you get in free if you work for Bank of America or you are a Bank of America card holder.   Only come when it's free.   You'll be wasting your money if you go at any other time.

My biggest complaint comes from how I was treated by the female security guard who walked up on me breastfeeding my son. We arrived as soon as the museum opened, and we were literally the only patrons in the whole building. My son was hungry, so I sat on the only bench I could find started nursing him. The security guard walked over from across the room and said \"..Oh!! Oh. You know we have a nursing room for that, right? On the fifth floor. So I suggest you go use that. Now.\" And she stood there next to me until I got up and left. I decided to check out that nursing room she was talking about...it was just the ladies bathroom.
