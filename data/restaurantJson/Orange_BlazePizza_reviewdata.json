I loved the ambiance of the interior.  The dark brown woods and rectangular dining area made the experience very hip.  The pizza did not disappoint and I was just in Chicago last week enjoying deep dish.  This pizza has a crunch to it and with your favorite toppings you'll be truly satisfied.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-06T09:44:26-0400", "location_id": "8375472", "id": "316628741", "user": {"username": "Lynnae B", "user_location": {"name": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "id": "60933"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Fired Up!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32825-d8375472-r314943149-m11068-Blaze_Pizza-Orange_California.html#review314943149", "text": "Orange has a home town feel surrounded by fantastic restaurants and scenery.  Just walking around the historic area and the circle, you can smell the delicious aromatic blend of food culture.  Blaze Pizza is among this unique place and the wood fired pizza is wonderful. \n\nThe restaurant rests and faces the inner circle.  There is a perfect view of the center park and fountain from the tables outside and inside the restaurant.  The restaurant has an open kitchen with an industrial flare.  The size of the place creates a noisy atmosphere, as the place is busy (very good sign).  You're greeted by a pizza maker, cafeteria style, and you create your own pizza or order from the diverse menu.\n\nYour pizza creation is placed in the oven in full view.  You can watch the dough bubble up and the toppings letting off steam.  It only takes a couple of minutes.  This pizza is placed on a parchment lined tray and handed over, but not without mentioning an offer for dessert; a wood fired s'more!  \n\nThe pizza is wood fired magic!  The crust reveals a delightful and flexible crust with a hint of crunch.  The fresh toppings are cooked to perfection.   The size of the pie could be compared to a jumbo tortilla.\n\nI'm so stoked and ready to go here again for a delicious meal.  It is fast food at its finest!  So, get fired up and enjoy the historic town of Orange and have a meal at Blaze Pizza.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-29T20:38:08-0400", "location_id": "8375472", "id": "314943149", "user": {"username": "PaletteontheGo", "user_location": {"name": "Olancha", "id": null}}}]}
