The wait was around 20 min. as stated.  Had an excellent bloody Caesar.  Our order consisted of 2 Flo filets 6 oz. with salad & bake potato which was a perfect choice.  The steaks were one of the best I have ever eaten, so tender, I could have cut with a fork, and very reasonably priced.  Everything was excellent from the Caesar to the steaks & service.  Excellent choice of dining experience!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-23T10:07:24-0400", "location_id": "4288504", "id": "357851130", "user": {"username": "Lyne D", "user_location": {"name": "Laval, Canada", "id": "155029"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Enj", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34094-d4288504-r352759097-m11068-LongHorn_Steakhouse-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html#review352759097", "text": "We visited with friends local in the area (Me and my boyfriend are from England) we had a 20 minute wait for the table, which was fine as it was super busy in the restaurant. We ordered a large array of starters including chilli cheese fries, kettle chips, corn fritters and and chicken bites, these were all tasty and went down a treat. For mains we all ordered the sirloin steaks with fries. I ordered mine medium rare, and it came medium rare. The steak was really tasty, it wasn't tough and really wasn't too fatty. We skipped on desserts as we were so full, we look forward to returning!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-03T19:04:35-0500", "location_id": "4288504", "id": "352759097", "user": {"username": "MissLisaFox95", "user_location": {"name": "Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom", "id": "609066"}}}]}
