Neither of us had eaten there prior to this, so it was a first for both of us.  We arrived at approximately 1130 hours (11:30 am CDT).  The restaurant was void of patrons.  The hostess / waitress was very pleasant and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  Albeit this is an older property, the restaurant itself is in fairly good condition and was very clean.  The lunch menu offers standard Americanized Chinese staples in the inexpensive to modest price range, and each selection comes with egg drop soup, egg roll, and fried rice.  The food is of slightly less than average quality.  The portions are adequate.  The egg drop soup was decent, the egg roll sparse, and the fried rice was just okay.  I had the Chicken Lo Mein which to my surprise was made with Ramen noodles versus Lo Mein noodles.  My intern opted for the General Tao\u2019s Chicken which he indicated was mediocre at best.  The Chinese Tea Garden is a mom and pop restaurant, just okay for a quick, economical lunch, provided that you don\u2019t set your expectations too high.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-08-06T10:14:46-0400", "location_id": "5541061", "id": "296372482", "user": {"username": "RooBoo", "user_location": {"name": "Decatur, Illinois", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Authentic Chinese food---run by a sweet little couple.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35883-d5541061-r267221148-m11068-Chinese_Tea_Garden-Decatur_Illinois.html#review267221148", "text": "I have gone to Chinese Tea Garden for years.
