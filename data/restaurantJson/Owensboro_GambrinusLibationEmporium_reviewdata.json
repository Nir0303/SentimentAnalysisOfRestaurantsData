We recently had our International Beer Festival and had on 26 rare brews, all of which you attempted to order.  We were lucky they lasted as long as they did, but sadly didn't make it until you arrived.  We still had 23 great drafts for you to choose from and many of those were still rarities as well, not to mention the 80+ bottles to select from.\n\nOn our \"BUY THE BEER, KEEP THE GLASS\" nights we only had a limited supply of glassware to give away and they're usually gone pretty early.  I'm sorry you arrived after everyone else who also wanted the glasses.  Sadly we don't get an unlimited number of glasses to give away every Tuesday, which is kind of what makes the event special.

We love the staff.  The service is wonderful.  The selection of craft beers is phenomenal.  They have, I believe, over 20 craft brews on tap at any given time and numerous bottled beers.  The ambience is relaxing.  This is a non-smoking establishment and for those less well-cultured as it relates to beer, you will not find any of the mass produced national brands at Gambrinus.  They also have a full bar, large Martini menu, solid wine list and a selection of appetizers.  Great place to go to unwind and spent time with friends.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-05-19T13:48:21-0400", "location_id": "2154381", "id": "273136057", "user": {"username": "Michael J", "user_location": {"name": "Owensboro, Kentucky", "id": "39722"}}}]}
