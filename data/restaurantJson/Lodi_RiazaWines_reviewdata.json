Try this change of 'place'  Riaza wine bar offers a taste of Spain with their selection of wines.  The Torrontes is a white (amber) wine and makes a great mango sangria.  They also offer a Dolce, which is like a port.  The bar is small, a few tables indoor & outside.  The Spanish olives are to die for and much different from the salty vinegar Italian style.  So good - We always pick up a couple jars when we stop.
