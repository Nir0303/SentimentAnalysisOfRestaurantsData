Had the mezze, appetizer, and the polish boy burger, wife had the chicken noodle soup, pork cheek appetizer and smoked pork chop, Problems: wife ordered the pork grackle, not the pork cheeks, server argued about it and just would not accept that we had the wrong dish, I asked for medium well on the burger, it came back as charcoal, completely burnt. The thin slices of kolabasi on top were Ok, but the overall burger combination with fries on it and what tasted like cattleman sauce was overall not worth the money. The pork chop came with some kind of greens that were so salty they were inedible. I have no idea how you can screw up mac and cheese, this was the other pork chop side, but it was terrible. I sat there with an empty soft drink glass for a long long time. I only saw one server on duty, she did not come back after the food was dropped off for a long long time, heck we were done when she came back, then I asked for a check and she came back 15 minutes later and said, can I do anything for you, I said, yeah, remember me, I asked for a check a long time ago. No manager came around and asked how we were doing. The place was not even that busy. This used to be a classy nice place that was sort of higher end. I was happy to pay whatever it was because there was great service and great food. This cost me $92 with 15% tip and it was frankly just terrible. W should have gone to the food court at tower city, would have gotten a similar meal for $25 for both of us. One observation is that the menu has been changed. It is now basically dumbed down with 4 different kinds of burgers. I am of the opinion is now lower class, and some genius is now trying to cheapen things to make money.

We used to live in Cleveland and Sans Souci was a special place for special dinners. The Mediterranean French cuisine was rich and wonderful. Last night... No cuisine available befitting its name. We decided to order the filet, which was a better selection for a celebration than a burger or fish and chips.\n\nWhat we got tasted like partially cooked and then microwaved.

In contrast to most modern restaurants, San Souci has an ambiance that lends itself to good conversation over good wine and good food.

The service was excellent and while we all chose steaks and fish, common to most restaurants, it was prepared to our specifications. We all had dessert. The cheesecake and almond cake both, were light and delicious.
