Loud voices had me incredibly anxious and the experience of being practically assaulted in my motel room was not something I expected from my stay.\nOther than this problem, the room was OK, comfortable bed, ironing board, fridge and microwave but no coffee maker, shampoo but no conditioner, TV got lots of channels but was old Zenith box with bad reception.
