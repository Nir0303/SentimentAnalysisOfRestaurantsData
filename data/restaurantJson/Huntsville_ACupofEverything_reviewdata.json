The coffee was wonderful, far better than the Starbucks and others.   The pastry's were varied and tasty; Sandwiches were prepared fresh and a delight to the pallet.  Not expensive by any stretch of the imagination.  If you are downtown, on courthouse square, and find yourself in need of a coffee, an expresso, cappuccino, a beer, glass of wine, a snack, or a quick meal - you owe it to yourself to try Cup of Everything.  I did and am glad I did.  In a day of hustle and bustle customer service it's nice to find a place where the customer really does matter, you can relax in a quiet atmosphere, and the food is fresh and tasty.  For a quiet get away go upstairs and enjoy the art work on display, and have a quiet moment with your favorite pastry and expresso, a delightful breakfast looking out over the courthouse square, or a quiet, but delightful, lunch.  Need a place for a quick business meeting, try Cup Of Everything you wont be disappointed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-02T09:08:08-0400", "location_id": "9785300", "id": "424422098", "user": {"username": "Alan M", "user_location": {"name": "Huntsville, Alabama", "id": "30620"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Quaint Coffeehoue for a impromptu meeting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30620-d9785300-r373724805-m11068-A_Cup_of_Everything-Huntsville_Alabama.html#review373724805", "text": "Great place to conect with business associates for coffee after work.
