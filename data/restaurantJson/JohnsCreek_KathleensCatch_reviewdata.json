It's primarily a fish market.  Which has some of the best fish in the metro area.  But you can buy pre cooked foods.  Kathleen always has a fish soup or stew available plus she has all kinds of dips just ready for your party.  She will also do party trays for you.  For New Years she did a tray of smoked salmon with cream cheese, capers and red onion as well as cooked shrimp with crab claws with a cocktail sauce and a truffled mayo.  Very very good.  If you're in the north Atlanta suburbs and need some fresh fish or a quick dip, Kathleen's is great.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-01T10:49:08-0500", "location_id": "3623272", "id": "246862900", "user": {"username": "BloggerLinda", "user_location": {"name": "Johns Creek, Georgia", "id": "1966009"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Not really a restaurant, but great fish monger", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1966009-d3623272-r236103984-m11068-Kathleen_s_Catch-Johns_Creek_Georgia.html#review236103984", "text": "While Kathleen's does offer some items to go, such as shrimp rolls, lobster rolls, soups and 'heat and serve' dinners, it is not an actual restaurant.  It is a small establishment with awesome fresh fish, shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops and oysters.  You can order live Maine lobster that is delivered the following day at a price far better than eating out at restaurants.  While I'm not a huge fan of the lobster rolls since I don't like celery or may, I can say I will never order lobster out at a restaurant again when I can steam it myself! I have been spoiled by Kathleen's and am diligently spreading the word about this great small business.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-24T13:50:39-0400", "location_id": "3623272", "id": "236103984", "user": {"username": "ScorpioJen", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta, Georgia", "id": "60898"}}}]}
