In her kitchen dishes are prepared that have made this part of China famous for its cuisine, and she takes no short-cuts with the ingredients. The menu is extensive and exotic---any menu that offers a section entitled \"Visceral\" and features \"Duck Gizzard\", \"Steam Intestines\", and \"Pork Ear\" gets my attention---but in my numerous visits here I have stuck with the more conventional \"Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce,\" \"Chicken Ball with Garlic Sauce\", \"Sweet and Sour Cabbage\", and \"Mapo Tofu\" (a Szechuan classic). This is a cuisine that calls for a liberal use of peppers, so if you are averse to hot and spicy then request a reduction in their use with your server (tip:  ask for the owner to come to your table; she is very welcoming and enjoys discussing her menu).  Portions are large and inexpensive (in the nine to thirteen dollar range), and each will be adequate for 2-3 people.  The tables and chairs were shipped from Shanghai, and with a little imagination you can feel that you are there.  If your mind works that way then this is your place.

This was something I missed since coming to California. In my former hometown we had such a place to feast on authentic flavors from China. Although I love the food of our local Chinese diners around here, they are tame to wonderful real flavors of the Sichuan region. Not that everything is hot like fire mixed with chilis, but rather full of flavor that makes you wish to enjoy your meal, not eat quickly. The service was very prompt and friendly. The place was clean, and very accommodating for special needs, mobility issues. The menu with photos is full of wonderful offerings. Some are probably new to the local folk, but try them. You will not only learn how another part of the world dines, but you might wish you had grown up there as well. I had the fish cooked in a wonderful chili oil sauce. The fish was fresh and moist, and full of a luscious warm flavor. Not overpowering hot, but comforting. It along with the Hot and Sour Soup made me feel very comfortable, and helped me relax and enjoy the whole experience of dining with my friends. I watch my friends enjoy their meals, from lamb to poultry, and vegetarian. All complimenting the freshness and surprisingly wonderful flavors of Sichuan cooking. Go, you will be very happy.

Then, having gotten their attention (other people meanwhile had arrived, ordered, been served, finished, and left) the food began arriving - in reverse order from the way it should have been.\n\nWhat was served was just blah.
