I go to Jerk Machine simply for the jerk, especially the Jerk Pork. In South Florida, you can probably find a Jamaican spot on every corner, and although you can find decent brown stew, curry, etc at most of them, it is very difficult to find some good flavored jerk in this town. Jerk Machine's spicy, smokey jerk is among the most authentic tasting in South Florida and I really enjoy it. \n\nLike most take out style restaurants, it can be a hit or miss depending on the time of day you go, so your best bet would be going around lunchtime versus later on in the day. Regardless, you will still get good food in a large portions at a decent price. \n\nIf you have ever been to a Jamaican restaurant, you would probably think that providing good service is not apart of the job, but everyone at Jerk Machine is actually really nice, helpful and willing to put on a smiling face.\n \nIn addition to grabbing a bit to eat, you have to try the Rum Pound Cake; it's really good!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-11-13T07:15:12-0500", "location_id": "890204", "id": "145320351", "user": {"username": "chewclue", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Lauderdale", "id": null}}}]}
