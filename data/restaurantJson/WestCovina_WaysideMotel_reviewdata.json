I reserved in advance an upstairs smoking room. When I arrived I was told they now only had a downstairs room at the very back of the motel (due to \"plumbing\" problems).  From what I observed the place was nearly empty. There were no microwaves or coffeemakers  anywhere and the only way I can describe the fridge is a mini cooler which is barely cool and fit 2 bottles of water and a container of creamer. The internet signal was too weak to even access which prevented me from doing any work (the next morning I was able to access a signal from a motel down the street for goodness sake!). And they charge for ice! Seriously?!  The carpets and showers are dirty and the rooms really smelly and worn out. Guess they haven't heard of Febreeze? They had gardners using power weed trimmers and blowers at 7:30 AM on a Saturday morning directly in front of the rooms waking everyone. The only positive thing I can say is that the bed was fairly cmfortable and the young lady at the desk when I checked in was very nice. And the police were there for hours raiding a room on Friday night. Clearly these people do not care about their guests or repeat business. Really a bad experience.
