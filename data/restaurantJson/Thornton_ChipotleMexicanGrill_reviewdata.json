The lady making the burrito did not know how to wrap it and it felt apart so she had to use to tortillas. As I went to pay they decided to charge me for that extra tortilla when it was clearly their fault and I had not asked for it. Our order of I repeat a barbacoa burrito and a veggie bowl came out to $25! Every other time I had only paid around 18 bucks for the same order.
