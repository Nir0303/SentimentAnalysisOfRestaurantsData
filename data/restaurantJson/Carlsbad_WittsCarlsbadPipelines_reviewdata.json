They seemed to really care about my family and getting them into wetsuits that fit (with some growing room).  They also helped us out with properly fitting them into the right surfboards.  My kids are past the beginning stages of surfing and are progressing.  They really put things into perspective for my kids about the size of board they should be riding vs. the size they thought they should be riding.  It was a huge benifit to their surfing.  Since then we have gone back and got them skateboards.  Again, the staff was friendly and knew how to get the best bang for our buck with all the skateboard accessories.
