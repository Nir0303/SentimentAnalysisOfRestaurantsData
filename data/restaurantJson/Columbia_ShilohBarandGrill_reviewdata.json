We had Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, Coleslaw, and Calico Baked Beans.  It was all delicious but especially the Calico Baked Beans, everyone wanted the recipe.  This is our second time using them for an event and we will definitely have them cater for us again.  We also enjoy eating at the restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-05-27T05:30:00-0400", "location_id": "954001", "id": "161981016", "user": {"username": "teresa0k", "user_location": {"name": "Columbia, Missouri", "id": "44257"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-05", "title": "Ribs & Specials", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44257-d954001-r160847089-m11068-Shiloh_Bar_and_Grill-Columbia_Missouri.html#review160847089", "text": "Ribs are some of best ever had.

The atmosphere was casual and pleasant, the sandwiches were great. I had the Hawaiian chicken sandwich, it was the best sandwich of this type that I've ever had. Grilled chicken, ham, pineapple and Thai sweet sauce made a great combination. There were a lot of choices on the menu, they all looked good.\n\nWarning, if you make this side trip the spur is crushed gravel like the Katy, 8.8 miles long and the trail is mostly uphill. The trip back down, of course, is much easier and quicker.
