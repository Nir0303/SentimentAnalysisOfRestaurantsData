It was open-flamed goodness drawing unsuspecting passersby in like only the Pied Piper could.  Very excited at this point. \n\nThe good... The burgers were appropriately sized and I loved the dress-it-yourself bar for all the onions, jalape\u00f1os and pickles anyone could want.  I really enjoyed the bun as it was very soft, but held together nicely.  Maybe the patty could have used a pinch of salt, but otherwise it was a great diner-type burger.  Oh, and the serving of bacon was portioned quite generously.  A very good burger experience, indeed. The onion rings were extremely high on my list....crispy, tender and soft in all the right places...excellent!  \n\nThe okay... Not much detail necessary, but the fried zucchini and potato wedges were...well, just okay. \n\nThe bad... The prices were a bit high...80 bucks for my family at a walk-up diner joint? Seems like a lot.  I also don't like that I'm basically eating at McDonald's, in terms of service, but they have a tip line on the credit card slip.  I hate that because I always feel inclined to tip.  I know...that's why they do it...but that's also why I say shame on them.  They should care enough about me as the customer to treat me right the whole process through.  That means not trying to intimidate/shame me into tipping.  I know...my fault, but still they could make the right call and get rid of it.  I mean they do nothing but take your order and call your number.  Weak!  Also, they had a frequent-burger card at the counter.  I ordered three adult burgers (and four kids burgers) which should count for three \"markings\" on my card.  They gave me two. I didn't say anything, because I'm not gonna be petty about it...but they certainly were.  I paid 80 bucks, I tipped nicely, and you couldn't make it your priority to make sure it was handled accurately.  That feels cheap to me.  The lady kind of gave me an uncomfortable look after...I could tell she was wondering if I'd call her out.  That's the only reason I'm writing this...it was clear she did it intentionally.  Service was below par for sure.  Prices were pretty high.  \n\nAll that said, if I find myself in the area again, forget the service I'll go back for that righteous aroma and killer open flamed burger.

Their homepage says, in part, \"Our friendly staff will cook your food to perfection at which time you can put any number of toppings on yourself...\"  I did my best to put my toppings on my burger, still I ended up getting a lot of them on myself!  So it goes,\n\nI'm no spring chicken and I can remember when there would be places like this along-side the \"main roads\" on the outskirts of towns.  I remember stopping sometimes with my parents and sister.  By the time I was 10 or so, the outskirts were more frequently viewed from the freeway and no one ever stopped anymore.\n\nYes, this place is a true relic.  It is so unassuming that, if my wife had not spotted it, I would have driven right by.  That would have been a tragedy.\n\nWhen we walked in and went to the central counter to order, I felt like I was about 4 1/2 feet tall again.  (\"Dad, can we get milkshakes?\")  The nostalgia is real, not pre-packaged.  It simply is what the place is.\n\nSo, on to the food:\n\nMy wife and I both got burgers and what burgers they were!  They are seared over real charcoal--crisp and charred on the outside and moist and tasty inside.  You can taste the quality of the meat which they grind themselves.  There are lots of condiments to choose from (and put on yourself, if you must) and everything is quality.\n\nWe also tried the Potato Gems and Onion Rings.  The Gems are thick cut potato wedges served with sour cream--wonderful!  The Onion Rings are home made, breaded not battered and cooked perfectly.\n\nWe left with milkshakes to drink on the way home--peanut butter and cherry--not combined.  The shakes are made with \"real\" hard ice cream and this makes a big difference.\n\nThe \"main route\" (old Highway 101) is long gone and two little towns have grown up to become small cities engulfing this little hold-over.  People know a good thing though and it is popular.\n\nI suggest to travelers to seek out this little diamond in the rough.  You will find good food and, perhaps, a memory or two.  It will take you away from the freeway and isn't that how we really get to see things?\n\nPS:  They also serve dinner plates of BBQ chicken and pork ribs.  Other patrons recommended both.

We also like the sweet potato fries.\n\nThere is lack of dining room space. Sometimes is it crowed and you have to share tables with people you don't know. This can be a negative or a positive experience. I have had both.

Very gracious staff even though we arrived 15 minutes before closing on a Thursday night. Patient to take our orders even though one in our party was Slooow to decide. We all loved our burgers! Yummy, old school, & grilled to perfection with fresh serve-yourself toppings even at 8:55 pm! The guacamole (served on the side) had just the right combo of chunkiness and creaminess & just the right kick of spice. The sweet potato fries (3 of us shared a basket) were perfectly cooked - crispy & sweet w/not a bit of grease and my chocolate malt was excellent! They have Bbq dinners too which I've not yet tried. I've also come here for breakfast and it's even better!
