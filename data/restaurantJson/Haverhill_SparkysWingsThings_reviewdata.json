My bf has gotten two diff flavors both times, so I can't recall his flavors. I do know that he loves spicy food. He tried the double trouble and didn't think they were hot enough. So he asked for a sample of the ghostrider sauce to put on a dry rub and it was crazy, make you sweat hot. I can't wait to go back to try a few more flavors!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-07-08T21:10:25-0400", "location_id": "879560", "id": "133809490", "user": {"username": "christie584", "user_location": {"name": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "id": "53449"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-04", "title": "decent food for too much $$$$", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41605-d879560-r129558273-m11068-Sparky_s_Wings_Things-Haverhill_Massachusetts.html#review129558273", "text": "My feelings on sparkies is complicated indeed. The selection is great and the flavors really are outstanding. In fact id eat here all the time if it wasnt for 2 things. First the wings are super small im not the kind of guy who orders boneless but with wings this small you really have to. My other problem is its just a little bit overpriced. The dinners arnt so bad but if you want to buy wings in quanity for a game there deals kind of suck. That being said the food as i said is yummy. I love the peanut butter and jelly which is really a chicken wing coated in a spicy indian peanut sauce with a fruit demi glaze coating. The contrast in flavors just works. In closing the food is good but the value leaves much to be desired.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-05-07T19:41:02-0400", "location_id": "879560", "id": "129558273", "user": {"username": "Brian G", "user_location": {"name": "Haverhill, Massachusetts", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Amazing Wings!

This hole-in-the-wall in Haverhill has some of the best wings I've ever had. They have a sauce called PB&J that sounds totally weird, but you'll love it if you order it. Sparky's regular buffalo wings are great too, simply called \"hot,\" and they have great steak fries that help tame the heat of the wings (along with the blue cheese and celery). If you're super daring, try the Ghost Chile sauce (ridiculously hot). And last but not least, the people who work at Sparky's are very friendly.
