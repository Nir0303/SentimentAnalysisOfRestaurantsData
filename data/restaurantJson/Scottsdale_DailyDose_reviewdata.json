The service was great and laid back (added 3 people). Coffee is very good and comes in a huge mug. I got the crab cake eggs Benedict and my husband got the flannel hash Benedict with the seasonal butternut squash hash on the side. Mine was really good with a buttery hollandaise and flaky crabmeat. I think I liked my husband's better with the rye bread, corned beef, kraut, onions and a hit of jalepeno with that same rich hollandaise on top! Our other friend got the strip steak and eggs and said it was perfect! I would recommend this place as a laid back, boozy, tons of options on the menu breakfast spot.
