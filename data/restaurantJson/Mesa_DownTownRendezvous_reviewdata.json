The variety, speed, service, quality, price, location...are all perfect for me.  I haven't had a bad meal yet. Only one meal (1) was not really good (the chicken was a little dry and tough). I do have my regulars that I love: chicken/pork quesadilla with grilled onions and chiles, cheeseburgers that are as good as I have ever eaten, and the daily specials that are as tasty as they are varied.  The 3 ladies that run it are wonderful, fun, creative, and personable.  I can walk in and tell them how I'm feeling and they can whip up something to match my mood...really.  I'm selfish, I guess, because I'm glad it's a little out of the way. This is my kitchen away from my kitchen.  Great food.
