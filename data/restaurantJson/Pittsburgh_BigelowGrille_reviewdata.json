After trying to get reservations at a number of other restaurants, we resorted to the facility in the Doubletree where we were staying, They were not that busy, though had to go through main desk several times to get restaurant to pick up the phone.\n\nOrdered a basic bottle of Montpelllier Pinot Noir at the usual 300% mark-up that such restaurants charge. Ordered a garden salad to split and my wife ordered the rainbow trout and I asked for the hanger steak mains. Waitress asked if we wanted an extra egg on each of the half salads, we said yes. Lived to regret that move...\n\nSalads came out, OK. Mains came out and steak was good - medium rare as ordered. I noticed my wife's trout looked very small as we usually trade tastes. Looking closer, I saw that they gave her maybe 3-4 oz. of a very thin half-fillet - maybe 2 x 5\" and about 3/8\" thick of trout. She never complains, and much to her chagrin, I had to flag down the waitress (who had not served the food) to ask if this was a mistake. She said we could talk to the manager if we wanted - said we said yes please. When he ultimately came out, he claimed the trout was running small at about 8oz. I pointed out that it wasn't even half of that. He did ask what we wanted, and we said we would live with that, but was reporting for their benefit that this would never be acceptable to most customers but my wife wasn't very hungry after a late lunch and her recent surgery limiting her appetite .I told him that was the most skimpy main portion I had ever seen at any restaurant, ever, but he didn't budge from his position.\n\nSo the bill comes, and the waitress explains he has taken 10% ($8) off. However, as we review the bill, they charged us $8 for the extra egg on the salad, and $2 to split it.  Net - we paid $18 for 2 half salads and could have had 2 whole salads for $16 since they were priced $8 ea. Good trick! This obviously more than offset the manager's $8 discount for the half trout debacle.\n\nI had already been writing in a 25% tip for the waitress since it did't seem to be here fault at first, and didn't want to leave the impression that we were cheap customers. In retrospect, she should have divulged the $10 uncharge for the extra salad issues and none of the staff ever expressed any remorse for the disappointing experience.\n\nI would never recommend this restaurant to anyone who isn't desperate to have an evening meal as we were after a 6 hour all day drive to Pittsburgh.
