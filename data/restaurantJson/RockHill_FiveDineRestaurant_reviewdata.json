We were greeted and told we could have our choice of tables. The atmosphere has retained a taste of it's origins as a nod to it's poignant history, but the predominant feel is cozy, not fussy, with a lean towards casual eclectic. It was a comfortable vibe. And despite the lunch rush having been concluded, the restaurant was very clean.\n\nOur wait person was extremely friendly and explained that they had just catered a major event and they were a bit harried, so an \"in advance\" apology was given, but as we came to learn, was not needed at all.\n\nI ordered the Country Fried Chicken and my husband ordered the Angus Beef hamburger. This burger was found on the dinner menu, but the chef was accommodating and said that ordering it for lunch would be fine.\n\nMy order came with mashed potatoes which they were out of, so fries were substituted.  I had sweet tea and my husband just water.\n\nWe did not have to wait long for our food at all.  Our food was hot and I have to say, at first blush, the chicken had the feel of being \"chicken fingers\", but with the added peppered country gravy...oh dear, I was addicted!! Very tasty!! The chicken was crispy and not a trace of \"grease\" could be found.  I so wish I could have had the mashed potatoes to go with that amazing gravy. The fries were...fries...but fries are a hard food item to get correct from kitchen to table so...no worries. My dinner came with plain steamed broccoli, I love broccoli but this order was a little too crisp for my taste. The sweet tea did the southern tradition proud. An aside - I did have a small salad with my meal and ordered the balsamic vinaigrette - dressing was a bit too \"tangy/sour\" for me, but, that's just me. \n\nMy husband's burger was cooked perfectly and he devoured every morsel. He was pleased, needless to say.\n\nOur wait person was attentive and like I said very friendly, engaging us in conversation. We wanted for nothing.\n\nOver all we had a very pleasant meal in a welcoming environment and I would say that it's well worth the trip to this small gem with a big history tucked away in beautiful downtown Rock Hill, SC.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-22T14:36:05-0400", "location_id": "5124601", "id": "408931765", "user": {"username": "Ourtwocentsworth", "user_location": {"name": "Rock Hill, South Carolina", "id": "54414"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Historical Landmark with Great Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54414-d5124601-r408806268-m11068-Five_Dine_Restaurant-Rock_Hill_South_Carolina.html#review408806268", "text": "We wanted to just grab a quick sandwich but were amazed by the number of mouthwatering choices on the menu!

We had a reservation for 6:30 pm. We arrived a couple of minutes early and were seated immediately. There we not many people in the restaurant when we arrived and thought we might get good service. The waiter took our entire order and brought our drinks to us. We then got our appetizers. After over an hour waiting for our entrees we were able to get the attention of a waitress as our waiter seemed to avoid our area. We told her we had been waiting for over an hour and she asked if we were waiting for our desert and we told her we were waiting for our entrees. She went and talked to our waiter and there was a flurry of activity and finally another waiter stopped by and said that our waiter hadn't sent our order to the kitchen. We finally received our order. The food was very good but the delay was unacceptable. We were told that the chef had slipped in the kitchen and hit his head so the owner was back in the kitchen cooking. We were told we could have a free drink while we waited. We asked for the same wine we had ordered when we came in and after a while our waiter came back and said they were all out of that one so we had to find another one. We kept hearing the wait staff telling other tables that they were out of things and that they were sorry. The Five & Dine didn't seem to be ready for restaurant week, or as a restaurant really, as they were out of several things people were asking for. I am sorry that there was an accident in the kitchen but not sending orders back to the kitchen is not very professional. As I said earlier the food was very good when we finally got it but the entire experience was disappointing at best. I will go back one more time to try the food again but if I hear the wait staff say they are out of something I won't return again. I got tired of hearing \"we are out of that\" and 'I'm sorry\".

I take full advantage of restaurant week and have never seen a restaurant so completely unprepared. For this reason, I wouldn't consider going back. For the record my son is an executive chef and has worked restaurant week in a few cities. He ended up making chicken and waffles for me. It satisfied my craving so now I don't have to decide if I would try going back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-09T15:00:50-0400", "location_id": "5124601", "id": "403399321", "user": {"username": "Betty D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great eggs cold grits", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54414-d5124601-r402397731-m11068-Five_Dine_Restaurant-Rock_Hill_South_Carolina.html#review402397731", "text": "Great atmosphere for Sunday brunch.

Originally had an 8:30 reservation but arrived much earlier. I found it strange that everywhere on line they indicate that they close at 8PM, which I'm wondering is why we left without ever receiving food. Received our drinks, and one hour and 15 minutes later we were wondering why the appetizer hadn't arrived, or any mention from the server that there was a problem. I then hear her walking over to another table and stating \"it will be out in a moment\". I looked around and realized most of the other tables was also waiting for food, which meant we had no clue how long it would take for us to get our food, or if we ever did receive it, half of it would have been cold and/or limp. We were so much looking forward to trying their chicken and waffles. An hour and a half later, we paid for our drinks and left a tip as we didn't know if it would have come out of the waitress' pocket. Thoroughly disappointed because of whatever problem the kitchen had, as well as the way the staff was able to handle the problem.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Selena K, Owner at Five &amp; Dine Restaurant, responded to this review", "text": "Sorry to hear that you didn't get to enjoy the meals that you came for.
