Best potatoes ever. \n\nHubby had the pull pork Benedict and he said it was very good but you can't go wrong with pork anything really. He had a favorite place for breakfast potatoes and 1909 blew that place out of the park. Is it obvious we really liked them? Lol\n\nI love how it's situated in old town cuz you can walk around and try to work off some of the amazing food you just had. \n\nWill definitely be returning for brunch in the future and also will try them out for dinner", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-12T15:23:20-0400", "location_id": "7233907", "id": "417651943", "user": {"username": "wifey_sd", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": "28926"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great Sunday breakfast!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33165-d7233907-r410000906-m11068-1909-Temecula_California.html#review410000906", "text": "They have bottomless mimosas on Sundays, and they don't skimp on the champagne (like they do at other establishments on bottomless mimosas)!!
