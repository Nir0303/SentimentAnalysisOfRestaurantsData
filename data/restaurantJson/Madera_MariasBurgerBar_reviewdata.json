Maria's Burger Bar got great reviews when we did a quick on-line search so we stopped in to this storefront restaurant.  While a burger was the obvious choice and those we saw being served looked amazing and hearty (as in giant size with mounds of toppings and fries), our hearts were set on something a bit lighter and healthier.  My husband ordered the Cobb salad and I opted for a salad topped with grilled chicken, apples, walnuts, blue cheese and such.  Wow, were we glad we stopped in.  The salads were amazing.  Absolutely fresh ingredients and perfectly grilled and herbed chicken.  The restaurant decor is simple and what you'd expect in his location but is was very, very clean as were the restrooms and the service was outstanding.
