No apology by the way--- When the order was returned, I am SURE that it was the same one I sent back. Still not cleaned and it was really unappealing.

On my last order, I realized there was an issue when I brought it home and saw that I was short on an entree. I called them up to tell them and they said to let them know next time I order and that it would be corrected. So I ordered take out and my wife ran in to pick it up. Once again, the order was not correct. They were short on the entree and when my wife complained, the cook started yelling at her as if it was her fault. The cook could care less and continued to argue. I was just about to go in there myself to confront him but I held back. If the cook or owner, whoever he is was business smart.....he would realize that the customer is right and not jeopardize the loss of a frequent customer nor a negative review for everyone to see. At the end, this really means little to their business...but all I can say is FAREWELL CHINA GARDEN.
