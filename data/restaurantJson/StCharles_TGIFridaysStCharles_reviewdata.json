We went on 4th if July about 6:30. Maybe only 20 cars in the parking lot. When we walked in they took our name and said 20 minute wait. There were loads of empty tables so they were apparently grossly understaffed. Then we noticed the sign that said \"no ribs available until 7\" so we sat at the bar and waited to be seated, which was after 7. Then it took the waitress about 10 minutes to acknowledge us and take a drink order. We asked if ribs were now available. She said not yet. Needless to say we went ahead and ordered something different . Really angers me that they were so unprepared. Perhaps they should have or could have offered a discount on something else? \nIt was at least 25 minutes for our order to arrive.. Chicken salad and a hamburger. Taste wise they both were tasty. Salad appeared a little wilted and not so fresh. Bbq Burger was fresh and tasty as were the fries ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-04T18:47:09-0400", "location_id": "5847343", "id": "389236815", "user": {"username": "Jill B", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis Missouri", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Happy Hour", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44876-d5847343-r385010678-m11068-TGI_Fridays_St_Charles-Saint_Charles_Missouri.html#review385010678", "text": "Met a friend for happy hour!!
