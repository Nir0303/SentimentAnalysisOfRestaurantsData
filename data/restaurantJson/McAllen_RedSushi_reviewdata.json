It was very fresh but not so spicy.  Ordered the rainbow roll as an entree and was good as well.  I will be back next time I'm in McAllen and hungry for sushi.

I was passing by last Saturday when I saw this establishment (I love sushi), so I looked it up on my phone and called in a reservation for 9 pm.  I went home got all prettied up and dragged the husband out for what I thought would be a cool dinner night - wrong. There was no need for reservations, the place was dead at 9 pm(they highly recommend reservations because they get busy).  I still decided to stay, so we sat outside.  I asked the waitress for a large sapporo beer for my husband and a lychee martini (both staple drinks at a sushi restarant) - 5 minutes later the hostess (who was also our watiress) came back saying they don't have lychee martinis, only skinny girl martinis (whatever that is) and she also asked for the name of the beer again.  I told her he wanted a Sa-ppor-ro and then i requested a drink menu (since we weren\u2019t given one).  She soon came back with his beer and a drink menu...told her I'll take the sangria...another 5 minutes later she came back saying there was none.  I FINALLY settled with a glass of moscato.  I then proceeded to ask some general questions about the menu\u2026this was another no brainer, it was basic questions about the food, what is in it, what would you recommend etc. every question seemed like a dead end.  She either was not sure or did not know and the one role she did suggest, the \u201cMcAllen roll\u201d completely and totally sucked.  Another thing was that when I went in to talk to the sushi chef \u2013 he didn\u2019t seem like the brightest tool in the shed either.  He seemed like he was only there to make rolls and nothing else.  When I asked if he had any special rolls that were not on the menu he just replied with \u201cI\u2019ll make whatever you want\u201d\u2026well \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask that!  As a sushi chef you should be creative, have your own idea, be willing to experiment with your kitchen.  That is what makes a great chef\u2026not someone that just goes off the menu and gets weird when someone wants to talk to you about your food.  I soon gave up hope on him and ordered a squid salad (which was OK because its premade and comes in a frozen bad), had some miso soups (with regular spoons not the traditional spoons), a McAllen role (which was horrible) and another role for my husband which was also just as bad.  After we managed to eat some of the food, we were offered dessert.  I was still hungry and figured that a mochi ice cream would help me survive\u2026THEY DIDN\u2019T EVEN HAVE MOCHI!!  Better yet, the watiress/hostess didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about.  They only had some banana crepe.  We were better off going to Kumori or Hyashi for dinner.  We were highly disappointed with this place.  If management for this place come across this rating \u2013 please visit a Kumori or Hyashi and see what they have to offer.  I say this because your establishment is NOT a sushi place, it\u2019s merely a pretty building with people occupying it.  Your staff needs to be more educated on your menu, know what it is they are selling, have your bar better prepared, expand your drink menu, have your chefs start creating more options for rolls and just learn how to manage a restaurant!  I could of done better than this.  I don\u2019t see this place lasting more than a few months.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-07-16T11:23:02-0400", "location_id": "4509837", "id": "167825498", "user": {"username": "kg8367", "user_location": {"name": "Edinburg, Texas", "id": "55786"}}}]}
