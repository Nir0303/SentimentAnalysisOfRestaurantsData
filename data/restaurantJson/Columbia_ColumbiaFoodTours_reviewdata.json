As well as take note of how many of the buildings bare this emblem \u201cThe National Register of Historic Places.\u201d\nThe day was gorgeous and the weather perfect, so the walk from location to location was pleasant. Especially with the inclusion of live southern jams wafting through the air. One the next stop we were truly in for a treat, \u201cVilla Tronco.\u201d  This little quiet corner of the city is home to this World War II-era spot that is the oldest restaurant that can confirm continuous operation in a state that dates back to 1788. WOW!!! We were fortunate enough to hear this story from Mr. Martin himself over a slice of their authentic Italian pizza and Carmella\u2019s original New York cheese cake?! You will NOT be disappointed.\nThere are a few more stops along the way each once leaving you speechless; only because you\u2019ll have food in your mouth. I\u2019ll close by talking about one more location that unless you take the food tour or you\u2019re a member of the \u201cCapital City Club\u201d \u2026.you\u2019re not just strolling in to eat, drink and be merry.
