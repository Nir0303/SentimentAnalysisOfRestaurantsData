Someone I know in San Leandro recommended Thai Satay, and it was a very good choice. We shared the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer. The kitchen accommodated us by making the rolls vegetarian. My friend had the pad Thai and asked that the kitchen substitute squid for the prawns. I ordered saut\u00e9ed eggplant and asked that the dish be mild. The kitchen got it just right. I liked that the restaurant was quiet enough for conversation.

The food is very good, the service is excellent, the prices are pretty typical of the area...problem is, the place looks uninviting from the outside. The building is looking shabby -- clearly the landlord is doing nothing whatsoever the make the outside attractive. The streetside windows are darkly tinted, to keep out the afternoon sun, but it results in making it almost impossible to see inside during the day. \nWhich is all a shame, because Thai Satay serves some very nice Thai food! I have never had a disappointing meal, and always enjoy the calm atmosphere, Thai music and gracious service.
