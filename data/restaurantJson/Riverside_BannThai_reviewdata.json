Truer words are hard to find.  This is a cozy, intimate restaurant with outstanding service and exquisite food.  \nOur party of four arrived a bit early for our 8 pm reservation but that presented no problem for the staff.  Despite all of us having been here before and being familiar with the generous portions, we ordered enough not only for dinner, but also some to go for lunch the next day.  We started with a split appetizer of both fried and steamed pot stickers, which again presented no problem for the staff.  Our dinner, which we shared family style, consisted of yellow curry, chicken pad thai, sweet and sour pork, and beef gra pow.  The yellow curry was presented just enough in advance of the rest of the dinner that we were almost finished with it when the rest arrived.  Everything was delivered hot and you could tell the ingredients were very fresh.  \nTwo side notes here:  1) When ordering, you will be offered a choice of spiciness on many items on a scale of 1 to 10.  Be careful, as most people will find 4 either as spicy as they want, or perhaps too much so.  2) Sam, the owner, informs me that a second location is in the works with an anticipated opening date in August.  It, also, will be located in Riverside.\nWARNING:  After a few visits here, you will enter as friends and leave as family.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-07-19T16:48:46-0400", "location_id": "2182298", "id": "216300381", "user": {"username": "Ron P", "user_location": {"name": "Bakersfield, California", "id": "32037"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Delicious Thai Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32978-d2182298-r213205577-m11068-Bann_Thai-Riverside_California.html#review213205577", "text": "The food was very enjoyable and very fresh.
