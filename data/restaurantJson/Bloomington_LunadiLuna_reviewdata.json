All of the ingredients of our respective meals tasted as though they were gathered fresh that day (rooftop garden perhaps???), I know that's not the case, but it sure seems like it. The dining area is surprisingly spacious and I love the lack of TV screens. The background music (recorded) is at just the right level of volume to not be a distraction. Staff is incredibly friendly. I just cannot say enough about this place, hope it becomes a Bloomington staple.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-24T11:04:05-0400", "location_id": "10387337", "id": "410159081", "user": {"username": "Lee P", "user_location": {"name": "Bloomington, Minnesota, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Hidden Gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42881-d10387337-r407702679-m11068-Luna_di_Luna-Bloomington_Minnesota.html#review407702679", "text": "My husband and I had lunch here few weeks ago.
