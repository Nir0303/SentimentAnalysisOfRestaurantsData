While he and our daughter were not able to taste the flavored vodkas, the were able to see the distilling process.  They have 12 different flavored vodkas.  We tasted them all and ended up purchasing the cucumber (very refreshing and smooth), huckleberry, coffee and bacon infused vodkas!   Yes, the last one is bacon.    The owner, Mark, experiments with different concentrations (and in the case of bacon, different flavored, like pepper bacon or Apple smoked, and different degrees of cooking the bacon) to get the perfect infusion, and thus flavor.   The special distinction about Montana Distillery is that the infusions are all real foods, not artificial flavorings. Real berries, bacon, ginger, vanilla, etc.   Most other flavored vodkas are flavored with artificial chemicals that taste as intended.   We found these vodkas, and the custom mixed drinks, especially the  Caesar, to be strikingly authentic.   A fun place, fun atmosphere and great spirits!
