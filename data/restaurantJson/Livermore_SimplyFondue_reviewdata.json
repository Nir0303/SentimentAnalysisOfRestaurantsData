This 3.5 hour dinner was terrible from start to finish so bare with me as the list of complains is long. Last night we ate here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. (They really should not take reservations for large groups, as they can not properly accommodate them.) Our group of 9 were seated at 3 tables that had been joined together end to end. We were assigned 1 waitress. Right off the bat my husband, another couple and I asked if we could be on a separate check since the four of us were at one table sharing a burner. No problem there. The four of us decided to order the Fondue Feast and decided on a cheese and cooking style we could share. \n\nMy friend and I had the California Caprese Salad. It is served \"drizzled with italian dressing\" which is strange, but whats worse is they were DROWNED in a terrible italian dressing! I wanted to send it back (which I very rarely do, but this was gross!), but the waitress did not come back to check on us through the entire salad course. I ended up scooping some of the dressing off and suffered through a little since I was starving.  \n\nWe were told we could order a second cheese if we wanted (It's included since we ordered 2 Fondue Feasts, but this was not clearly explained to us at the time). So we picked a second cheese. One of the cheeses arrives, and its a little while before we realize we only have one cheese. We ask our server who tells us our other cheese is on the burner 2 tables down (being eaten by the people sitting down there). So the four of us shared a appetizer and dippers meant for two and we unintentionally fed our friends seated at the other end of the table our other selection. I should mention that the rest of our group of friends ordered alla cart and we were not keeping track of what they were ordering so thought nothing of the cheese at the other end. \n\nMeanwhile, our dirty dishes are piling up and none of us have water. Our waitress appeared to have several other tables besides ours and we rarely saw her. Eventually I cleared some of our dirty dishes myself. \n\nTime for the main course. Our food arrived without any dipping sauces. We had to wait for our waitress to reappear to ask for some (there was lots of waiting for service). When she did appear, our friends 2 tables down asked for sauce. She came back with only enough for them, and left before our side of the table had the chancre to ask her to bring some for us too. The burner at our table was not heating the food properly. I wanted to ask someone to turn the grill up, but again, no one showed up. Once our friends finished cooking their food they had to cook ours for us too! I finally got up to complain to the manager and ask for a second waitress. The manager said she would see what she could do and another 10 mins go by before they reappear with a second waitress. By now I am so frustrated with the whole situation that I just want to skip desert, but we stay for the birthday girls sake.  \n\nThe waitress says we can order 2 chocolates with our Fondue Feast. When the chocolate arrives one is placed on our burner and one on the burner at the next table. A plate of desert dippers were set next to each. I notice that there are only 2 of each desert dippers (there are 4 of us), so I ask our server if we can have a second plate of dippers. She informs us that we already have another plate of dippers, it is on the other table (half eaten by the people sitting in front of it). I'm sure she saw the disbelief on my face, so she asked if I would like her to get it and bring it over. I told her that it was already half eaten and how awkward it would be to take it away from our friends at this point. I asked if she could please just bring one more plate since THEY messed up by putting it in front of our friends. She said no, that each chocolate comes with one plate and that we already got two. I continued explaining to her that we did NOT get two because they were not both placed on our table. It was like talking to a brick wall. I finally dropped it. \n\nAt the end the manager announced that she removed the gratuity from our tab since we weren't happy. No apology for giving away 2 of our courses, or for our burner not heating properly, or for the terrible salad, for not receiving dipping sauce, and terrible service. I told the manager that just removing the gratuity was not enough. In the end, after reiterating all the problems (again!) she ended up giving us a discount off both checks but still no apology! I have never experienced such poor service from a restaurant. They served HALF of our food to our friends and then told us we were SOL! Unbelievable. It's the next day and I'm still dumbfounded by the whole experience. Do yourself a favor and go to a fancy steakhouse, same price for better quality food and service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-21T14:52:41-0500", "location_id": "1015367", "id": "349814750", "user": {"username": "erinangele", "user_location": {"name": "Bay Area, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Date Night at Simply Fondue!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32635-d1015367-r347480404-m11068-Simply_Fondue-Livermore_California.html#review347480404", "text": "Really enjoyed our visit to Simply Fondue.  We kept it simple for our first time.  We just did the cheese and the meat sampler.  More than enough for my wife and I.  They have multiple broths to cook your meat in.  We chose the cajun which was very tasty and a good choice.  The choice of broth can be a big difference in the taste of your meal.  The cheese fondue was excellent.  Lots of flavour and worked well with the break and vegetables.  They also have different selections for cheese.  My wife was \"coerced\" into doing a dessert.  This was amazing.  One nice thing is if you bring in a bottle of wine from a local winery, there is no corkage fee.  We took advantage of this by bringing a nice bottle of Merlot from Wente.  Any fondue restaurant is expensive.  If you are a big eater and expect large portions of food, a fondue restaurant is perhaps not for you.  If you don't like doing your own cooking or are not very patient, then fondue is not for you.  Fondue restaurants are a very slow process but a lot of fun.  And Simply Fondue was a a very nice restaurant with great service and consistent pricing for a Fondue restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-13T17:15:16-0500", "location_id": "1015367", "id": "347480404", "user": {"username": "Redbarr12", "user_location": {"name": "New York", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32635-d1015367-r345931632-m11068-Simply_Fondue-Livermore_California.html#review345931632", "text": "We ate here at lunch and enjoyed a nice meal, good food, quiet atmosphere, attentive but not overbearing service.
