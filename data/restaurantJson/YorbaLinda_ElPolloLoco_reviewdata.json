It was FILTHY. The counter in front of the condiments was covered with spilled sauces and other detritus. Every table that I was able to check was dirty. The manager was having some kind of intense conversation with two employees in the corner and the counter staff was standing around doing nothing to address the dirtiness of the store. I used to really like EPL, but nearly every time I have gone to one of the locations near my home, I left disappointed or downright angry. I could see this if it was really, really cheap, but EPL is one of  the most expensive fast food restaurants around. \n\nGet your act together EPL. Fullerton (Othorpe), Placentia (Plac Ave) and YL Stores are terrible! They are nearly always dirty, the tea dispensers are frequently empty, staff is surley/lazy.
