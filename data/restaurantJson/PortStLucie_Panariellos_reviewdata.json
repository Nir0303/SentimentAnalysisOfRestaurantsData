Being away for the summer we were anxious to go back.  We were so disappointed!  The start to waiter was coughing all over us, he said he had a sore throat.

We were very pleased. Being from NJ, we were looking for good Italian food. There was a couple having pizza which looked great. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan and eggplant rollatini. Both came with nice salads and spaghetti. The free garlic rolls were delicious. We had more than enough leftover for another meal. Highly recommend.
