Last time I went, our server seemed a little put off that we were splitting one dish between two people, but didn't say anything about it.

I think they used to flavor it with jasmine, or some floral essence like that, but the last time I went it was just regular water. Not a huge deal, of course.\n\nI can see how people might get confused in terms of ordering, because they don't have menus at the tables, and the only menu is inside on a large chalkboard.

And the owner is authentic and caring. Of course, with home-cooked meals and fresh foods like made-from-scratch hummus and baba ganoush, eating at Arabesque is like eating in a genuine home kitchen in the Middle East. And I suppose the service is the same; if you're in a private kitchen and you appreciate and respect the cook, you'll be treated accordingly (extremely well!). As for the reviewers who comment on the owner being something other than perfectly nice, I can only presume that they brought it upon themselves.
