We didn't get refills on drinks unless we worked at flagging someone down.  The restaurant didn't get really busy until after we had ordered.\n\nThe food came in a timely fashion (once the long wait to order was over), but I had to go hunt for someone to get the bill, and then to pay it.  We had 2 hours between arrival and our event, which we thought was going to be more than adequate.  Not true.  We walked into the theater with one minute to spare.\n\nMy wife had the gnocchi, which came in a marinara sauce that had a strong taste of some herb I am not familiar with.  Just threw the whole dish off.  The sauce on my chicken cacciatore (SP?) was  similar, but without the strong back flavor, but the chicken itself was pretty underwhelming, kind of like a carrier for the sauce.\n\nThe price was Ok, but the food would have to be better for us to go back anytime soon.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-14T15:30:56-0500", "location_id": "814273", "id": "437243675", "user": {"username": "Michael T", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Ozark, Missouri", "id": "44569"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Average", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32358-d814273-r437107810-m11068-Joe_s_Italian_Cuisine-Escondido_California.html#review437107810", "text": "Took over 2.5 hours for dinner - way overwhelmed staff.
