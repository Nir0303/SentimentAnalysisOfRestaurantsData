I ordered an enchilada, taco, rice and beans. My husband ordered the carne asada which came with an enchilada, rice and beans. My husband was disappointed in his carne asada because he said it lacked flavor and was not very tender. I really loved the enchilada, I thought the sauce was very good. The rice and beans had great flavor as well. My one complaint though would be that the taco and enchilada seemed very small compared to other places we've visited. They also seemed to be priced a bit higher then our usual place which would be fine if the items were of equal size. They have two areas for seating which gives them lots of room. We chose to sit in the back room area which only had one other couple. The problem with this area though is that the table we were seated at was right under the ac vents which blew right down on our food and cooled it off. Granted it was very hot outside but you really shouldn't place the tables right under the vents. Service was a little bit slow as our waitress was new and said it was her first time doing this. Not sure my husband would go back but I would go back for the salsa, and the enchilada, those were that good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-30T13:05:12-0400", "location_id": "10374832", "id": "399305446", "user": {"username": "Shell1965", "user_location": {"name": "Bakersfield, Ca", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Great discovery!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32037-d10374832-r398649601-m11068-Red_Grill_Onions_Mexican_Cafe_and_Bar-Bakersfield_California.html#review398649601", "text": "If this place has been open long, then we regret taking too long to go.

I had the Los Angeles combo, which included the best chile relleno I've had in a long time\u2014because it wasn't breaded.

I liked that the tortilla in the enchilada had not been over-cooked, either in or under too much sauce.
