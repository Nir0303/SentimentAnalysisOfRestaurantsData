I didn't sample my friends food, but they were disappointed with their quesadilla and nachos. I got a fajita wrap, and it was a cold chicken salad comprised mostly of olive and red onion with a lot of mayo, which just wasn't what the description let on. Nothing heinous, no hair in our food.

Very attentive, great customer service. Very generous alcohol pours.\n\nFood depended on what we ordered.  Chicken strips rated excellent.  Burger was burnt and dry.
