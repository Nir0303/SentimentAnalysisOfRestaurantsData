The Harry's fried chicken is hands down thee best island fried chicken in town & the Charsiu saimin is equally as good. We like to get a side of fried wontons as well because they're soooo delicious! Very small place with 4 tables but you could choose to carry out as well. I would definitely recommend going when your in the South Bay Area! It's that good!!
