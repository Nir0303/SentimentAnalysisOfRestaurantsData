These are the old style slightly greasy fries...although they are now cooked in rice oil to be healthier.  I normally order the cheeseburger basket that includes burger, fries, and a medium fountain drink. Price is $8.35 if my memory is correct.  That's more that the chain restaurants, but the food is so much better.  Be aware that it gets pretty busy at lunch on weekdays....lots of big takeout orders for the local industry.
