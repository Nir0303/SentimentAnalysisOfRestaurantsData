That, my friends, is Hampton City Hall, an archaic-looking structure that houses local government offices. \"Designed\" by Rancorn Wildman Architects of Newport News, it functions as primarily an office facility. It's quite easy to find, just a few blocks from Hampton's restaurant district and aerospace museum. There is a local debate over whether city hall was built 35 years ago or is actually newer and just really poorly conceptualized. When it rains, the outer concrete streaks with water stains and takes on the appearance of an abandoned parking garage. The interior has been remarkably updated in recent years, getting the latest technological upgrades for city employees. This goes against all reason, as I personally have been expecting a building so hideous to suffer a controlled demolition. I cannot vouch for the work that goes on behind the doors of these important local offices, but as an architectural marvel it is certainly a hot topic here in Hampton.  Locals are unsure if it will be replaced one day with something that doesn't resemble a giant robot head, something we aren't ashamed of, but we are hopeful. I'll give it 2 stars for having a decent-sized parking lot.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2011-09-19T07:53:38-0400", "location_id": "2233700", "id": "118322044", "user": {"username": "JohnTravoltasFriend", "user_location": {"name": "Hampton, Virginia", "id": "57804"}}}]}
