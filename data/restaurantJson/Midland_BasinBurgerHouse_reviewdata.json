At the end of the meal, we all 4 had the same impression.  Not coming back.  Although the atmosphere is really nice and the place is clean, the food and service just doesn't compete with other choices.\nMy first test of any waiter/waitress is when I order my water.  I specifically ask for water and NO ICE.  If they are really listening to (me) their customer, then I get no ice but that only happens about 30-40% of the time.  Yep, I got the usual ice water here.\nAmong the 4 of us, the common observation was:\n1.  The food was barely warm when served.\n2.  The potatoes were swimming in grease.\n3.  The bacon was raw.\n4.  The menu is very limited and if you are looking for a serving that will feed something less than an army, you are out of luck.\n5.  Nothing special like eggs benedict, so if that's what you want, go to Wall Street or The Bar.\n6.  Once the food arrived, the waiter went AWOL.  I had to go find some hot sauce for our table.\n7.  Knowing math or how to use a calculator isn't a requirement of employment.  We asked to split the ticket 50/50 between us two couples.  The checks were over 3 dollars difference and the waiter simply said that it was as close to a split as he could get.  Really?  As close as you can get is like a cent or two.  Maybe \"X\" divided by 2 is asking too much.\n8.
