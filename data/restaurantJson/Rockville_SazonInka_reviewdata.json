Let me begin with the positives.\n\nThe portion sizes are truly pretty big. I ordered a Lomo Saltado and it was a legit two meals in size. Yay for doggy bags. My family which I went with ordered a whole chicken with 4 sides for 20 dollars, which considering the size of the sides is fair. My Lomo Saltado consisted of deliciously marinated steak strips with onion and tomatoes on yuca fries. The yuca fries were not the best I had, but the steak was da bomb diggity aka tasty. My server, Jessenia, was very positive and kept checking in on us. They had 3 different sauces to try with our fries and yuca that tasted like magic and luck had a baby in sauce form. My taste buds couldn't get enough of those sauces.\n\nSome of the negatives were they seemed to be out of stock of a few items. They were out of Horchata and some hot sauce for our whole Peruvian chicken. In addition they were having issues with the AC system not working. I felt fine, but my family was sweating bullets.\n\nIf you eat at the restaurant you can get 2 free hours of parking which is great since the area is full of paid parking, but no free spots. All in all this place is pretty darn good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-10T16:38:31-0400", "location_id": "7827919", "id": "403860577", "user": {"username": "Lcdthethird", "user_location": {"name": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "id": "28970"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "We liked this place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41353-d7827919-r361923997-m11068-Sazon_Inka-Rockville_Maryland.html#review361923997", "text": "Having picked up carryout Peruvian chicken several times previously, we decided to visit for a sit down dinner.

The restaurant is not fancy, but it is inviting.  The service was very friendly and personable.  Yes the food did take a little while, but sometimes that is not a bad thing.  I feel at times some of us have forgotten to appreciate the fact that it will take some time if someone actually makes your food when you order it.  Anyway, if you do go I urge you to venture out of your familiar zone.  The ceviche was excellent with thinly sliced tilapia bursting with citrus flavor.  The onions provided a nice contrast.  I ordered the aj\u00ed de gallina, a typically Peruvian dish consisting of chicken in a yellow pepper sauce.  While it did not completely wow me I am glad I tried it.
