Apollo is a pretty good (but not perfect) substitute. This was my first time back since the management changed and the dining room was refurbished. The menu is reminiscent of Ambrosia--a hodgepodge of Greek (and now Lebanese) traditional dishes and pizzas mixed in with a standard diner menu. Ordered the beef shwarma and a gyro platter--both were very good and portions were huge, although tomatoes in the salads were a light pink. Service is friendly and efficient. Prices are no longer the screaming bargains that they were under the old management, but are still decent--we got out for $43 (with tax/tip) for the two platters, a salad, dessert and soft drink. The one thing holding Apollo back from being a great diner experience is the early closing time (8:00).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-11T15:23:52-0500", "location_id": "4249923", "id": "436471415", "user": {"username": "tubman", "user_location": {"name": "Maryland", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "An \"Oasis of Comfort Food and Libation\u201d with reasonable prices located in Rockville\u2019s \u201cTown Square\u201d Chaos!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41353-d4249923-r370515715-m11068-Apollo_Restaurant-Rockville_Maryland.html#review370515715", "text": "Apollo Restaurant and Bar is an \u201cOasis of Comfort Food and Libation\u201d with reasonable prices located in the heart of the Rockville\u2019s \u201cTown Square\u201d Chaos!

If you are in a suit, ask for the meat to be removed from the skewers, no problem for this kitchen full of professionals.
