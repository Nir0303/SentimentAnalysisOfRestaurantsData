When we walked up to the counter the attendant just stood there and just starred at us until we asked if we could place an order. The attendant didn't greet us, or say welcome to Jimmy John's, or my I help you, just starred. \nThe menu left a lot to be desired based upon what we were told prior to visiting the restaurant. When we finally decided we asked for chips and he pointed same went for napkins when we asked. Then we got our subs that took them less than I minute to make. The 8\" subs were two prides of sourdough bread with 3 slices of bacon, a little bit of lettuce and two sliced tomatoes. We had to open the bread to see what was inside. Never have we had such a terrible lunch for $20.00.\nWe will never visit another Jimmy John's again and make sure our friends know of the terrible experience we had. Save your money and go somewhere that gives you a fair sandwich and service at a fair price.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-11T14:05:17-0400", "location_id": "8861796", "id": "417258633", "user": {"username": "Dcain0713", "user_location": {"name": "Sequim, Washington", "id": "58737"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Love Jimmy Johns", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58838-d8861796-r413684932-m11068-Jimmy_John_s-Yakima_Washington.html#review413684932", "text": "Great sandwiches and fast service.
