We had to point out to her that the menu stated otherwise. She had to ask the chef if this was the case.  There are several sauces that come with certain entrees, such as the one on my chicken.  When I asked her what it was, she gave me the wrong information, it was completely different than what I was told. At one point she had to ask the chef what one item on the menu was.

But Think he was the only server that day. He made a production about singing & never did or mentioned again. Very disappointing ! And not particularly cheap either. Brought coffee, and when told he offered to heat in the micro! Really?? Could go on but one gets the picture. It's a SHAME.

This is the second time my spouse and I have been since. I cannot understand why there isn't a huge waiting list to get in. The New Orleans inspired menu is fabulous. The chef came to our table to ask how everything was, and talked about his culinary style. We have tried the steak, salmon, meat loaf and chicken. The homemade biscuits are delightful!
