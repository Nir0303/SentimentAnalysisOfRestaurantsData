We're glad we did! The house is not airconditioned and as this was one of the hottest weekends of the summer we were a little concerned upon our arrival when shown to our room. There was a large fan in the window and Laura assured us that it would be sufficient. Amazingly it was and we slept very well all four nights we stayed with little noise audible from the street. The breakfasts were wonderful with a bountiful basket of delectable breakfast pastries, a variety of fresh fruit and several cereals to choose from. Laura was not intrusive, but pleasant , friendly and informative. The cats seemed almost invisible and, if there were two, we never saw more than one.

Day before our arrival I received a call from Laura, the innkeeper, saying she was going to be out of town during our stay; she arranged for a friend to meet us and let us in.  Rebecca was very nice and accommodating; however, for 2 nights we were alone in the house which was a little bit funny feeling. The innkeeper did come to our room at 6:30 am on the final morning to introduce herself and get our credit card; she said she was leaving \"for work\" so at 7 am when we went down to eat  she had put all the breakfast on the table and left.  Never had such a strange B&B experience  The first major problem is that we werent told there is no air conditioner so with mid 80 temps and only a fan in the room, sleeping was not real comfortable; we tried opening only window in room and all windows in bathroom; however, first 2 nights people were in the yard behind the house so couldnt sleep w/windows open.  There was no shampoo, kleenex, or cups in the bathroom so I made a trip to the kitchen looking for a cup.  That was when I was faced with a VERY CLUTTERED and not so clean looking kitchen.  I could not believe all the junk on the counters and when I opened the fridge looking ffor some bottled water or ice I was quite shocked at condition; there was a big bag of dried out looking scones and a commercial pkg of wheat croissants which turned out to be the same items we had on all three mornings (croissants replaced w/biscuits 3rd morning).  So, breakfast was not really homemade and I felt  a little squemish eating anything from that kitchen; fresh fruit and juice were fine.  The other big item is the 2 cats that had free rain of the house w/food bowls in kitchen; they howled several times during the night especially around 4-5 am~~guess they wanted out but innkeeper not there.  The rest of the house was tastefully decorated but had we known there were animals roaming at will (and probably jumping on kitchen counters), no air conditioner, and same breakfast used every day, we definitely would not have stayed.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2010-06-24T17:06:42-0400", "location_id": "670275", "id": "68590992", "user": {"username": "MOTRAVELERJoplin", "user_location": {"name": "JOPLIN", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2010-06", "title": "A nice room, but just the necessities", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60913-d670275-r68029547-m11068-Wayfarer_Bed_Breakfast-New_Bedford_Massachusetts.html#review68029547", "text": "Overall, I had a nice stay at the Wafarer B&B.

We originally wanted the seashell room, but it was booked up until the end of August, so we went for the Autumn Room.  The room had a warm breeze flowing throughout the room, a fireplace (which we used at night), a newly renovated private bath, and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  The house was airy and filled with great art work.  The colors warm yet bold, I loved the feeling of just city on the back porch and looking out into the garden.  The back yard has a jacuzzi, which we found a great place to lounge and sip wine.  At night we would walk downtown, which is about 5-10 minute walk away, and eat dinner.  We loved the Italian restaurant called Ballena, they have a singing waitstaff.  The inn keeper is kind and charming, and quite a good baker (orange-ginger scones, fresh multigrain breads).  She also writes and illustrates children's books.
