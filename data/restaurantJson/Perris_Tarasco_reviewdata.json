As it was afternoon we sat out on the patio - warm, lovely, and filled with families also enjoying their day.\n\nThe chips came promptly, warm, crisp and delicious as before.  We ordered guacamole, which came out freshly made, nice and chunky, and the salsa was quite good, great flavor and just a touch of heat.  My wife had the New Mexico style enchiladas, as she had last year, and said they were excellent.  I mentioned to our server that I had the crazy burrito (half chile colorado and half chili verde, which was superb) before, and she said I should try something else for variety.  So I ordered a combination plate with a grilled shrimp taco (soft) and their chili relleno, rice and beans.\n\nThe taco was delicious, the shrimp were plump and nicely grilled, and the toppings gave good flavor.  The chili relleno was quite frankly the best I believe I have ever had!  It was huge - where does one get a chili that large?!  The cheese was thoroughly melted inside, and topped the relleno as well.  The batter was light, fluffy and delicious, and the sauce was outstanding.  I have always felt the best way to judge a Mexican restaurant was by their chili relleno, and Tarasco is tops in their field!\n\nOur server was very attentive, service was consistently fast and pleasant, and she spent time with us talking about anything we liked.  We were extremely pleased with every aspect of our meal, and glad to see the quality had not changed from last year.

Everything we have tried here has been even better than expected, and it seems to be pretty popular with locals.  The service was great and our waitress really  was fun and helpful, as well as very attentive. Some of the better guacamole we've tried in a while, and great salsa.

The service is excellent and the food is authentic and delicious.  On a recent visit I ordered the carne asada  taco plate from the lunch menu.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  It came with rice and beans, both of which were equally yummy.  The food at Tarasco's is the star but the patio dining area is like taking a trip to old Mexico.  On a nice Spring day, the outdoor ambiance really enhances the dining experience.  It makes you want to sit there and stay all afternoon with a nice tall beer.
