The location is very convenient to the downtown hotels, and I was surprised at how trendy (in a good way) the Fremont East district has become. The treatment room is clean, quiet and very stylishly decorated. Andrea is just the sweetest, and very good at her job. I had the back treatment, foot massage and facial. All were excellent and the price was unbeatable. I will definitely recommend Feetish to others and hope to return next time I'm in Vegas!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-09T09:37:59-0400", "location_id": "7399187", "id": "308566736", "user": {"username": "luvvacay", "user_location": {"name": "Colorado", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Andrea is wonderful", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d7399187-r288585808-m11068-Feetish_Spa_Parlor-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#review288585808", "text": "My daughter and I loved our time at the spa.

I am so glad I chose to go to Andrea!  She runs a one room spa upstairs from a neat little coffee shop about a block east of the main Fremont section.  I chose the back and feet package and it was worth every penny.  Andrea made me feel so comfortable and I really enjoyed talking to her.  She gave me good tips about places to go in the area that only locals know about.   I've got my new spa spot in Vegas, can't wait to go back next year!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-03-25T07:16:55-0400", "location_id": "7399187", "id": "261636885", "user": {"username": "carabenkoz", "user_location": {"name": "North Little Rock, Arkansas", "id": "31818"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Great Spa relaxation experience.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d7399187-r249233282-m11068-Feetish_Spa_Parlor-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#review249233282", "text": "Got the full relaxing experience with Andrea, hour back massage, 30 min facial and 30 min foot massage, she customized off the basic package for me.  Probably the best my feet have felt in years.  She is so friendly and welcoming.  The location is pretty neat, you walk through a hipster coffee shop with record albums and art work decorating the rooms then go upstairs to her one room spa.  I felt at home immediately with the Victorian Era/Gothic feel it was cozy and calming all at the same time.  I will recommend this to any friend who comes to Las Vegas as a must do pampering experience.\n\nI'll definitely come back next time I'm in town.\n\nThanks Andrea :-)", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-01-13T22:10:51-0500", "location_id": "7399187", "id": "249233282", "user": {"username": "Elizabeth H", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts, United States", "id": null}}}]}
