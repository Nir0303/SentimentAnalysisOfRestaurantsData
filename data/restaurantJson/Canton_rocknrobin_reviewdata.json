I am a supporter of downtown Canton businesses and had heard nothing, good or bad, about this restaurant. We visited on a First Friday, which has to be the busiest night of each month in Downtown Canton. It was comfortably full, with live music, and a happy, comfortable feel. The staff was busy, yet everyone seemed happy. Our waitress was very good, keeping us informed of the status of our order, and apologizing for a kitchen delay, even offering to comp one of our meals, which we declined since she had been so up-front with us about the delay. My scrod and hubby's pork chop were very good. Clean restaurant located a few blocks out of the arts district, but worth a visit. I hope you will be pleasantly surprised, like we were.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-05T18:02:21-0400", "location_id": "6280339", "id": "227207304", "user": {"username": "Sherry H", "user_location": {"name": "Canton, Ohio", "id": "50168"}}}]}
