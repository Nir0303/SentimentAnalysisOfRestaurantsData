Really nummy. The meat in this sandwich is very good ...not stringy and fatty at all. There are fresh baked cookies and hand crafted granola as well as salads and soups.  They sell a very tasty frozen yogurt sandwich using  chewy oatmeal cookies.  Have not tried the other soft frozen yogurts.  Friendly staff and very clean interior with country decor.  Next to Maya Cinema and just down the street is The National Steinbeck Center.Good local haunt ...give it a try!", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-04-15T18:16:03-0400", "location_id": "6154337", "id": "201331047", "user": {"username": "frankie57salinas", "user_location": {"name": "salinas", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-01", "title": "Had lunch there", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33002-d6154337-r192748988-m11068-Farm_Fresh_Deli_and_Cafe-Salinas_California.html#review192748988", "text": "This deli had just opened up and had to try it out. \nHad a great Pastrami Pasture sandwich.\n Good choices of bread. \nVegetables are locally grown. \n\nWill be going back to try the soup and chili.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-02-01T04:36:31-0500", "location_id": "6154337", "id": "192748988", "user": {"username": "LuigiCalifornia", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "ja", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "\u6fc3\u539a\uff01", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33002-d6154337-r423324877-m11068-Farm_Fresh_Deli_and_Cafe-Salinas_California.html#review423324877", "text": "Maya\u30b7\u30cd\u30de\u3067\u6620\u753b\u3092\u307f\u305f\u5e30\u308a\u306b\u3088\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6c34\u66dc\u65e5\u306f\u30ef\u30c3\u30d5\u30eb\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u304c99\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u304a\u5f97\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002\u5473\u306e\u7a2e\u985e\u304c\u6ca2\u5c71\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u6fc3\u539a\u3067\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5e97\u5185\u3082\u7dba\u9e97\u3067\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-28T15:22:30-0400", "location_id": "6154337", "id": "423324877", "user": {"username": "Lululu831", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
