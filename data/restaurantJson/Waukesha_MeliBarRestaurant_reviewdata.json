We joined friends there for dinner on a Saturday night. Because of the eternal destruction and reconstruction of Waukesha's central city roads, you need to park behind the restaurant in the Riverwalk area and walk over to its entrance on Main St. When we arrived, our reservations, made via the restaurant's Website, were nowhere to be found. We were told, \"That's often a problem!\" Luckily there were plenty of tables available, presumably due, in part, to the aforementioned road construction and street closure. The menu's the thing here, so we decided to try some unfamiliar dishes starting with a Saganaki appetizer featuring flaming imported Kefalotiri cheese fired right at your table. Interesting and tasty, but we had to ask for some crostini's to spread the cheese on. Most of us decided to go with a small plate and a salad for dinner. I chose to have the House \"Bar\" cuterie which included a sampling house specialities including falafel and rice balls as well as chicken wings (no, really legs) and Kalamaki (chicken/veggies ke-babs). Mostly good, not great. I had a crab Louie salad for my main course-kind of fishy, mushy and warm and not so great. Others had gnocchi and beet salad which they enjoyed, though the beet salad was short on beets. Overall, the food was OK, but didn't quite match the excitement of the menu itself.

In addition, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, including being gracious with a returned dish.  We recently moved to Waukesha County and are always looking for great little places like this with interesting menus and cocktails that aren't part of some conglomerate.  That's why it saddens me to have a not-great review.\n\nWe started with saganaki, which I haven't had in years.  It was served properly (including the \"opa!\") and was a great starter - tasty but not too filling.  I then ordered the grilled flank steak with chimichurri (I'm a sucker for chimichurri), cooked medium-rare.  Unfortunately, when I got it, it was entirely gray and chewy.  When the waitress checked on us, she saw immediately that it was nowhere near MR and whisked it away.  She quickly returned with a MR steak.  Unfortunately, this steak quickly finished cooking on my plate - I can't fault the cook for this because s/he had to cook it QUICK to let me eat my meal with my husband.\n\nThe steak was served not with the chimichurri on top, as usual and as described on the menu, but on top of the chimi.  This immediately cooked the chimi, with the result that it kind of just tasted like salty grass clippings.  Chimi is a great steak-topper because the brightness of the fresh cilantro/parsley contrasts nicely with the beef.\n\nThe side dishes did not save the meal, either.  Neither the roasted potatoes nor the seasonal vegetables had any discernable seasoning - even a bit of olive oil on the veggies would have been appreciated.  The veggies seemed to be steamed with no fat or salt added, and included cubed eggplant which I first took to be mushroom.  Steamed, unseasoned eggplant is not tasty.\n\nOn the upside, Meli carries a fish I'd never heard of before - swai - which my husband ordered.  It was delicious!  A white-fleshed, tender mild fish served on a really nice bed of creamed roasted cauliflower.  Who knew farmed catfish could be a standout?!\n\nOverall, the space is really nice, and I suspect the craft cocktails are worth a look (my menu was missing the cocktail page).

They serve small plates to pass around as well as large plates that you can also pass around or eat on your own. We especially liked the mushroom risotto and the braised lamb gnocchi. Decor is modern with plenty of the art that is starting to distinguish Waukesha.
