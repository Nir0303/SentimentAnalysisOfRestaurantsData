The dim sum was made to order & very good (they have a larger selection on their weekend brunch menu). I was skeptical about ordering the Peking Duck because they said it comes pre-rolled (I prefer to prepare my own rolls). When it finally came to the table I think there were 6-8 rolls (I can't remember exactly its been a few days). I was extremely disappointed, there was very little of everything...duck, scallions & Hoisin sauce. I had asked the waitress if they could make the skin extra crispy when ordering & she said yes. No extra crispy skin & the duck was very fatty (my apologies if I am grossing anyone out), it was totally not worth 24.00. \nThe couple next to us said they had been coming for years & have always found the food very good. Gauging by the quality of dim sum my companion had, we will most likely come back & try this place again, but I won't be ordering the Peking Duck again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-13T05:52:29-0400", "location_id": "5456120", "id": "417953295", "user": {"username": "ez2plzlll", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Very salty food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29277-d5456120-r385906689-m11068-Bistro_Chen-Arlington_Heights_Illinois.html#review385906689", "text": "First time here at this restaurant and it has a pretty modern d\u00e9cor.

The har gau and shrimp chive dumplings had too thick of a skin while the siu mai was something that you would buy from the local supermarket.  The XO turnip cake was very salty and mushy.

Since there is lack of good dim-sum places in suburb Chicago, I decide to give it a try.  We were there on a week day.  The place was not crowded and we ordered some common/familiar dim-sum items.  \n\nBefore the food arrived, the waiter gave us greasy plates.  Our table was in a well-lit spot and the uncleaned grease clearly reflected off all four plates.  I immediately complained and some better cleaned dishes came before the meal.  They must have just rinsed these dishes without really cleaning them.\n\nTheir pork sui mei was competent.  We also found their taro cake acceptable.  But the pork and shrimp in bean curd skin must be the toughest version I ever encountered in the US.  This is usually a dish after streaming will become soft and easy to cut and chew.  That was not the one I got on that day.  We also ordered a pan fried noodle dish, it has good flavor although a little too salty for my taste.\n\nOverall this place tries to elevate the dim sum dishes in the Chicago suburb but I am not sure what kind of target audience they have in mind.  In general some of their dim sum dishes are acceptable and better than most found in the AH area. The dish quantity is about 33% or one-third less than what you can get from the Chinatown.  You need to keep that in mind if traveling to Chinatown is inconvenient for your party.  So this restaurant cannot win on food quantity and it also cannot win on food quality.  About the atmosphere and decor, it is nothing special and the owner definitely does not place emphasis on the American folks as PF Chang does.  I can see the thin-line cracks on my table while waiting for the check.  This could be just my table is somewhat old and the rest is just fine.  However, everything I see is marginal.  So unless you are hungry for some dim-sum dishes and really cannot drive an hour to Chinatown, you most likely will not become a frequent diner in this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-12-31T11:33:32-0500", "location_id": "5456120", "id": "246734231", "user": {"username": "WheelingTraveler", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Yum!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29277-d5456120-r246618530-m11068-Bistro_Chen-Arlington_Heights_Illinois.html#review246618530", "text": "This is some of the freshest and highest quality Chinese food in the area.

My favorites and recommended are the Veggie Crepes (weekends only), Veggie Tofu Wrap, Steamed Greens, I also enjoy the apple and seaweed salad. They have favor flavorful sauces to pair with the dishes.\n\nThe Chinese entrees look fantastic, we'll have to stop in to try in the evening.\n\nLastly, every so often they get fish fresh from Japan.
