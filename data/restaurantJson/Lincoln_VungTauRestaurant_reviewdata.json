This review is just based on my taste buds.  My wife and I went here for lunch and she ordered a large bowl of Pho with flank steak and some other meat in it.  I ordered a chicken breast and shredded pork over rice.  My dish looked half normal with the chicken breast on one side, but on the other side was what looked like caramelized onions.  Whatever it was, it did not taste like pork or have the consistency of pork.  It tasted like a powdery substance of some kind.  It was not good.  The chicken breast was fine, but quite plane.  The soup looked quite good, however, it was fairly run of the mill as well.  Plain beef stock with some noodled and meat in it.  There was some good meat, but some very rubbery meat as well.

It was amazing, total bill was $22 and i still think the price of bubble tea is expensive at $3.75( same at every vietnamese restaurant).  The food is amazing and is as authentic as it gets since it is family owned. Simply the best vietnamese in town period! and i have been to them all", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-06-11T19:41:06-0400", "location_id": "2166368", "id": "112809976", "user": {"username": "briant72", "user_location": {"name": "Lincoln, Nebraska", "id": "45667"}}}, {"lang": "de", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2011-09", "title": "Einfach gut.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45667-d2166368-r118342854-m11068-Vung_Tau_Restaurant-Lincoln_Nebraska.html#review118342854", "text": "Ich war mit Arbeitskollegen in der Mittagspause im Vung Tau Restaurant. Von Au\u00dfen ist der Laden auf den ersten Blick nicht besonders attraktiv. Als wir den Laden betraten, der mir von den Kollegen empfohlen wurde, war ich erstmal von der Anzahl der G\u00e4ste \u00fcberrascht. Ein Restaurant, was tags\u00fcber so gut gef\u00fcllt ist, kann ja nicht schlecht sein, dachte ich.\n\nWer ein gediegenes Restaurant erwartet, der wird entt\u00e4uscht. Das Lokal ist einfach und schmucklos gehalten und die Sitze sind nicht besonders bequem.\n\nDas Essen jedoch ist gro\u00dfartig, ausreichend portioniert und wird in kurzer Zeit an den Tisch gebracht. Ich kenne mich mit vietnamesischen Essen nicht aus, daher kann ich nur sagen, dass das Schweinefleisch sehr lecker war. Auch die Suppen meiner Kollegen h\u00e4tten mich reizen k\u00f6nnen. \n\nEs ist zu vermuten, dass ich nicht das letzte mal dort gegessen habe.\n\nDie Preise sind g\u00fcnstig und alle Gerichte k\u00f6nnen auch mitgenommen werden.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-09-19T18:14:10-0400", "location_id": "2166368", "id": "118342854", "user": {"username": "Monty_GER", "user_location": {"name": "Mannheim, Germany", "id": "187290"}}}]}
