Food was just fine except i had literally 4 french fires in my mechanata sach. in the meantime waitress didnt even ask if everything was ok or anything. We understood that it was pretty busy but there are some standards...looked like she didnt care about us at all. At the end after waiting another 10 mins for a check we realized that the club soda is for $1.50a glass. We had 4 of them so for $6 i could easily bring a bottle or two  of Perrier or Pellegino instead of club soda from the gun... Anyway the service was way below average food was just ok nothing special. What we liked was that on the menu you can see everything on the picture as well as online. Thats very convenient and was actually cool...So im not even sure that id like to come back there during a daylight and being helped by another server. That is a below average restaurant", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-04T20:01:13-0400", "location_id": "9592999", "id": "414775435", "user": {"username": "Jakub K", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "First timers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35889-d9592999-r398845672-m11068-Restaurant_Mehanata-Des_Plaines_Illinois.html#review398845672", "text": "4first timers.
