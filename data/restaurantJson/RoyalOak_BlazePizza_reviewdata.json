The crew behind the counter is the most unprofessional crew I've ever had to deal with. The conversations they have between crew members is not only unprofessional, but very uncalled for and sometimes vulgar. Countless fights between staff leave me wondering if they even have anybody in charge. Members walking out during shift or shouting profanity at each other's mistakes, definitely wouldn't recommend bringing children here. Only thing that could save the place is the food. Surprisingly delicious food, unfortunately each crew member will portion out your toppings differently, too much, too little. Lack of training and leadership are the major problem, I believe.

Great place to go with a crowd... or by yourself, since they have special half-pizza-sized takeout boxes.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-13T03:32:22-0400", "location_id": "4846051", "id": "228593552", "user": {"username": "sunchaser485", "user_location": {"name": "Taipei, Taiwan", "id": "293913"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "cold carry out", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d4846051-r213117841-m11068-Blaze_Pizza-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review213117841", "text": "Pizza was flavorful, but pick up for carry out was hectic, and it was cold 3 minutes later when got home.\n      \n      \n      ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-01T08:33:22-0400", "location_id": "4846051", "id": "213117841", "user": {"username": "willndtw", "user_location": {"name": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Great all the way!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d4846051-r210735010-m11068-Blaze_Pizza-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review210735010", "text": "What a treat to find tasty and creative pizza at a great price and prepared quickly by upbeat staff!
