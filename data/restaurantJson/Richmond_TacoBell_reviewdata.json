The taste is exactly like every other Taco Bell out there.  What I do appreciate is that so far the employees I have encountered are no less than tactful and effective, usually better than that.  Being that it isn't the most glamorous of jobs, I personally really appreciate it.  I work with people who make a lot of money and live lavish lifestyles, and they could easily take a lesson in tact, courtesy, value of another human, and decency from the people who work at this Taco Bell.  The downside?  Not the best part of town.  If after dark, keep an eye on your surroundings while you wait (this applies to the drive thru).  And don't look at the ground - lots of lil \"critters\" outside enjoying some quick food too.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-08-05T18:11:02-0400", "location_id": "4655465", "id": "401897193", "user": {"username": "Jonathan G", "user_location": {"name": "Richmond, California", "id": "32964"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Always the same bean burrito!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32964-d4655465-r315232201-m11068-Taco_Bell-Richmond_California.html#review315232201", "text": "No mater where you go you there's the ubiquitous Taco Bell, no not authentic Mexican  but if you like something, say the bean burrito then you will like the one in California just like the one in Tennessee, or the one in Florida, that's great.
