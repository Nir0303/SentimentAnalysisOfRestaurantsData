I asked a question about the parking when I first arrived to make sure where I parked was okay and barely received a response from the bartender.  Then when she asked what I wanted to order, I asked about the beer selection on tap.  She responded by waving her hand over to the taps and rudely said \"they're all right here.\"  Later on, two of my coworkers were ordering a round at the bar so we were standing at the end where the opening of the bar was.  We were all equidistant to the opening and partially blocking the path the bartender was using to get in and out of the bar.  She walked through us a few times and as we were getting ready to move, she got right in my face and rudely said \"you need to move, over there, now!\"  She didn't ask the two people that were standing with me to move, her negativity and rude demeanor was obviously directed at me alone.  I'm not sure why I was singled out by this bartender but I will never set foot in the Red Rock Tavern again because of the horrible way I was treated there.  I will also be calling the owner to make a formal complaint against this rude individual.  I would not recommend this bar to anyone and hope this comment is received by the owner in the event he/she is not aware of how this staff member treats the customers.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-24T06:26:23-0400", "location_id": "417868", "id": "376092570", "user": {"username": "HK1024", "user_location": {"name": "Hartford, Connecticut", "id": "33804"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Great atmosphere", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33804-d417868-r267305768-m11068-Red_Rock_Tavern-Hartford_Connecticut.html#review267305768", "text": "Red Rock is a fun, casual restaurant / bar.

I love this bar, nestled a block away from the Capitol in the Frog Hollow neighborhood.  The staff is as friendly as you will find - the owner, Don, knows that customer service and experience comes first.  He'll be the first one to wave to you when you come in the door and spend time chatting with you.\n\nThe beer selection is pretty good with a local beer or two always on tap along with a mix of standard beers and imports.  The food is definitely a level above most pub fare, and a pretty extensive selection ranging from sandwiches/soups to pasta and fish/chips. Its a little meat heavy but the kitchen is very accommodating. They definitely hit the sweet spot balancing quality, quantity and value.  The eggplant parm dish will feed you for three days.  Always a nice selection of rotating specials as well.  \n\nThey have live music on Saturday nights (no cover charge) with cover bands playing a diverse mix of classics and they have DJs as well (check the web site for schedules).\n\nThere is also an intangible about this bar that is hard to describe. The customer base is incredibly diverse but its not cliquey - everyone is friendly to one another.  Its a great venue for group gatherings as well since with plenty of space.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-01-29T07:49:43-0500", "location_id": "417868", "id": "192476354", "user": {"username": "Norm2020", "user_location": {"name": "United States", "id": "191"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-10", "title": "Good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33804-d417868-r183448699-m11068-Red_Rock_Tavern-Hartford_Connecticut.html#review183448699", "text": "We got the Italian burger (really good) and clam strips (average).
