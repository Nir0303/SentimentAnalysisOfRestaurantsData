Since the downtown area is maybe a block long and really doesn't have the type of storefronts we go to I never even knew of the Main Street Restaurant. But saw it the other day and decided to try on Sunday morning for breakfast. \n\nThe restaurant is located on Main Street (gee, you think?) just far enough off Imperial Highway to not be noticed. We parked just down the street and walked to the front door. When we walked in my first impression was we were in the wrong spot. You walk into what looks like a small bar with a few tables around it. But then noticed a small dining room to the left which was a bit cooler than the immediate bar area. This was nice as the outside temp was already close to 90 on it's way to 106. We were greeted after a minute or two and pointed to the dining room without menus. The dining room was sparsely filled with two gentlemen at one table and a family of five at another. We sat at one of the four remaining tables. After about a five minute wait the menus appeared. As I looked it over I was glad to see it wasn't one of those that has 500 items on it. One page with mostly traditional breakfast items. There were also about five \"authentic\" Mexican breakfast items. \n\nOur server wandered over and asked if we had any questions while recommending the Eggs Benedict and the egg skillet choices. I asked about the Tex-Mex Omelet and he was honest enough to say he had never tried it. So I went with the Eggs Benedict and my wife the Pancake Sandwich with bacon. The food took about 15 minutes to arrive which is fine as I know it's being made to order. Without a doubt the Eggs Benedict was awesome. Seriously there are so many ways to screw up this dish (eggs poached too long, runny Hollandaise sauce, tasteless ham/Canadian bacon). Yet this came to me perfectly. The dish comes with home style breakfast potatoes which were also pretty darn good. My wife's breakfast was good but not great, typical pancakes and eggs. The syrup comes separately heated up in a small bowl which is a nice touch. The size of the meals are pretty substantial as well.\n\nOverall I think we may have found a hidden breakfast treasure. It's a small place but appears to also have an outside patio although how you get there I have no clue. But the service was attentive and pleasant, the food overall very good, and the cost reasonable. Our two meals ended up about $20 (not counting tip). It's safe to say we'll be back, maybe to try lunch or dinner.
