Our party of four arrived two by two, and each arrival was about twenty minutes apart from each other. \n\nOnce everyone arrived, our party was present at Randy's for approximately one hour and twenty-five minutes. It was an 'experience', however, I will save you some time if you are in a hurry, it certainly was not 'fine dining' by any stretch of the imagination. Initially, the service staff on duty was moderately proactive. However, the further we journeyed into our experience, our service gradually continued to get much worse the closer we were to the end of our meal. Just to be clear, we had all first arrived, there was no other patrons in any of the dining area, or bar area from what I witnessed. During the last thirty-five or forty minutes or so, none of us were even asked if we wished to have our drinks refilled [water], and all but one were empty most of that time. \n\nSERVICE GRADE:  FAIL\n\nNow let us discuss the food quality and taste. The Steak and dishes served this particular night, I would consider average at best. The dishes were fine, nothing tasted bad, but certainly there was not one item placed in front of us that stood out. This includes the Steak. My wife and I dine out frequently, and have done so together for years. We would equate the food placed in front of us for this experience at the same level as what someone would receive at say, while eating at a Texas Roadhouse. It is edible, but nothing is going to 'Wow' you.\n\nFOOD QUALITY & TASTE:  C+\n\nWe will now address \"Customer treatment after the meal, and during the time we attempted to use our acceptable, recognizable, and ALL LEGAL forms of payment. My wife and I requested for a certain amount of our balance to be handled as a 'Split Payment'. A portion was to be taken care of by a Groupon we had in our possession, which was completely good and certainly had not expired. We also had a GIFT CARD, which Randy's Steakhouse issued.  Here is Wikipedia's definition of a Gift Card [ = Cash Equivalent].\n\"A Gift Card (also known as Gift Certificate in North America, or gift Voucher or Gift Token in the UK[1]) is a prepaid stored-value money card usually issued by a retailer or bank to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases\". The 'On Duty Manager' would not take our Randy's issued Gift Card [as Cash Equivalent]. My suggestion to Randy is, if you do not wish to treat it as a 'Cash Equivalent', then do not call it a Gift Card. This is the only business I have ever come across in thirty plus years of being in business that doesn't seem to understand the simple definition of what a Gift Card is, and that it is 'Cash Equivalent'.  When the On Duty Manager told us that their Randy's issued Gift Card would \"not be honored with the Groupon, due to them both being 'Promotional items'\", and that \"we can use the Gift Card on our next visit\", we almost in unison stated and instructed \"We won't be back, so you can throw it in your trash\".  Grade for Customer treatment, and what any sane business person would consider 'Business knowledge and Business Etiquette 101'?  The owner needs to read the definition under what he offers promotions, cash equivalents, et cetera. If Randy's Steakhouse does not wish to treat it as a 'Cash Equivalent', then do not issue it as a 'Gift Card'. Either that, or print the 'Rules of use' ON the Gift Card.  \n\nCUSTOMER TREATMENT: Fail\n\nIt seems a large percentage of the Reviews I read on this restaurant are not positive. My wife and I are in agreement, and we will never dine there again - even if it was free.   \n\n.    Now here is where things get interesting.\n \n\nWe have dined at hundreds of Restaurants in both the good ole USA, and a large number of foreign countries.

I had been once for steaks and remember it being okay. Another time, we went for Sunday brunch and it was good. We had not made reservations and went around 8:00pm. We were seated quickly, which was nice. The hostess was very sweet.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and has great potential. Unfortunately, he did not seem to have been trained. It was apparent that he had not been allowed to taste all of the menu options. I feel this is important since most people ask for recommendations. Also, he had not been taught to open a bottle of wine. After reading reviews on here today, it seems that may not be taught to most staff. The crumbs were not removed after the meal, which is standard practice in all of the other steakhouses Where I've eaten. I really hope he can get the training needed because he can be outstanding! Great personality!\n\nAs far as the food...bread was okay. I really liked the paprika butter, but my boyfriend did not. The steaks were supposed to be prime grade.  The NY strip was lower quality with significant sinew. The filet cane out sizzling on a plate floating in butter. When I cut into it, it was medium as ordered. After a few minutes, it was well done and had continued to cook on the plate. Mac and cheese was okay, but the forgot to put the crunchy topping on top. The waiter raved about this topping when we ordered. The creamed spinach was extremely cheesy with cheddar cheese. Pretty sure the spinach was frozen previously. Some bites were cold. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e...I needed a hammer to break through the layer of caramelized sugar. The actual custard was good! As we are writing this review, we realize there was a problem with everything except for the bottle of Sterling Pinot Noir after it was finally opened. \n\nWe did not complain about the food quality while we were there, since it wasn't bad enough to complain about.  The entire room to the right was closed off, so that may have been part off the issue. My boyfriend has eaten here and had good experiences, but stated that Randy has always stopped by the table. In his words...\"Perhaps Randy was out while we were in.\" \n\nWe love supporting local business which is why it is so sad to write this.
