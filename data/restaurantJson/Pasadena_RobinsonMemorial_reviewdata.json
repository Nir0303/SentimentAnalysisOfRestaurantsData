The statues are busts that are 9 ft x 6 ft x 7 ft and weight about 2700 lbs each. The memorial was dedicated on November 6, 1997. The Jackie Robinson bust has engravings that are barely visible that tell short stories about the impact he had in his community, not just baseball. The sculpture also has images engraved on the back of his head. \n\nThe Mack Robinson bust is also sculpted in the same manner with descriptive texts and images on the back of his head. Since Mack never left Pasadena, he is facing City Hall. Jackie left for Brooklyn so he faces east towards Brooklyn. The landscape around the monuments was completed on June 20, 2002 with benches and peach tress to honor their birthplace of Cairo, Georgia. This area lends itself to anyone who wants to sit and reflect or ponder. \n\nThe area is beautiful and so peaceful. The City Hall building in front of the monument is gorgeous and looks very old. A lot of people take wedding pictures here. The area is clean and organized, perfect for a family outing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-11T02:21:43-0400", "location_id": "10170321", "id": "363274000", "user": {"username": "Oliver R", "user_location": {"name": "Las Vegas, Nevada, USA", "id": null}}}]}
