The fish was very fresh and great prices. The only downside for me was that the sides were very bland. Yet, it was nice to have a fresh healthy meal. There was a line out of the door when we arrived so it took a little while to get served, but there was plenty of seating. There was also a small sushi bar inside the restaurant. The restaurant offered three fish that were the 'catch of the day', so I assume this changes. This place also has a place people can buy fish to take home and cook. The chips and salsa were also very good! The people in front of us stated that they drive 2 hours to get this restaurants Poke. We walked here from the beach, and it took about 25 minutes each way.
