The atmosphere was great and the employees were fabulous.  Everyone of them greeted us as we entered and they really took great care of us.  Our waitress Jess was so friendly and attentive.\nMy wife had the chicken sandwich and I had the Sloppy Jose sandwich.  Both were delicious.  We also had the shrimp wonton appetizers.\nThey gave us free mud pie for desert and it was to die for.\nThank you for 35 years of great food and service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-27T14:03:19-0400", "location_id": "519404", "id": "386666637", "user": {"username": "Tom S", "user_location": {"name": "Missoula, Montana, USA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Sea bass", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45277-d519404-r386628029-m11068-The_Depot-Missoula_Montana.html#review386628029", "text": "Here after the saturday meet. Had the Chilean Sea Bass with ginger wasabi glaze. It was buttery but a little fishy. The Pepper Bridge cab was quite good. The pilaf was ok but they forgot my roasted asparagus. Service was pleasant but their first cab recommendation was off the mark. We were in the wine room downstairs so after a busy day at the pool, the peace and quiet was very nice. Likely back again the next time down.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-27T13:14:11-0400", "location_id": "519404", "id": "386628029", "user": {"username": "James C", "user_location": {"name": "Great Falls", "id": null}}}]}
