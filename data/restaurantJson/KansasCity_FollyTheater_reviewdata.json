During the concert, I noticed all the exquisite wood designs in the moldings and light fixtures. Not knowing the history of the Folly Theatre prior to attending, I wondered how old it was and what the walls would say. \nDuring intermission my architect boyfriend and I discussed our thoughts of the building. I thought this building was around 1890- early 1900 and DBF said maybe 1910's. We spoke with one of the guides and it was built in 1900. Boy does this place have a past!! They did a great job at restoring it. \n\nThe restrooms are modern yet everything else is restored. Friendly staff. Great location. Parking garage is right next door. Parking is tight, so leave the big trucks and SUVs at home.

This is an old theatre, but it is well maintained.  My one, & only complaint is that they have absolutely no waiting area for before the time they let you go to your seats, and what little room there is in thr small lobby is taken up by the will call booth, a bar, & the area that they sell merchandise.
