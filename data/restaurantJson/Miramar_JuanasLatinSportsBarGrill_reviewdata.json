I first went there 2 months ago for lunch and it was a good experience....food was good, service was good. Now the 2nd time I went there it was completely different. Everything that could go wrong DID. First, we had a waitress that only spoke Spanish. She did not know what a Jaagermeister shot was....even though they had the Jaager machine at the bar. I had to literally get out of my chair and show her. I digress. First we  were seated. I ordered the Mofongo with pork chunks which was great last time I was there. This time it was DRY...horribly dry and undercooked. I asked for a Margarita before ordering food. It took literally 15 minutes before the margarita arrived. Their excuse....there was no bartender. If that's the case, close the freaking bar. Ridiculous. I drank my Margarita after already eating half a portion of my Mofongo. I then asked for the Jaager shot. Again...a fiasco. I had to point out the machine to her and it took about 5-10 minutes before I received it. Keep in mind the restaurant was EMPTY...there were only 3 small groups of people at that time. We then asked for salsa sauce. The sauce had rotten tomatoes in it. The smell was unbearable and the taste was just like ROTTEN TOMATOES. My wife's sister never had her water glass refilled....none of us had our water refilled. The food came fast...that was the only good thing. Then Mrs.Juana decides to show up and check up on our table. We told her about the rotten salsa and she immediately confronted the waitress and went back in the kitchen. However, NO FOLLOW UP was made with us regarding this. No apology, no discount. Nothing. Terrible customer service. I asked the hostess if they recently changed cooks and she said yes....I had a hunch because the food was good 1st time I was there. Anyhow, the restaurant was overpriced for the quality of food we received. Between the 4 of us, we paid 91.00.   I of course should have left NO tip, but being the nice guy that I am, I left her a 5.00 tip. I will never visit this place again.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-07-18T09:22:25-0400", "location_id": "5426569", "id": "216084614", "user": {"username": "filo74", "user_location": {"name": "South Florida", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Superior food and service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34454-d5426569-r209888296-m11068-Juana_s_Latin_Sports_Bar_Grill-Miramar_Broward_County_Florida.html#review209888296", "text": "Our family of four visited on a Sunday night.
