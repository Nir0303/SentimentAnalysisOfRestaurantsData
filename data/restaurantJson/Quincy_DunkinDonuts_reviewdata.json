The outside sign was neat but once we stepped inside our excitement quickly passed. The employees forget that they are working at a historical location and dont appear to appreciate that fact. They clearly dont realize that some of us travel hundreds of miles to visit this location and are quite excited to be there. The workers rushed us to make our donut selection all while we were looking around trying to enjoy the moment....there was no line so the rush was not necessary. My husbands favorite Dunkin Donut is the Chocolate Long John which of course he eagerly requested. The lady very rudely said \"what do you want?\" Of course he once again requested his favorite long johns and she looked at him like he was a three headed sea creature and responded with a very nasty \"I dont know what you are asking me\". Clearly she has had someone from the Midwest visit and ask for this type of donut. No effort was made to talk to us, invite us to their historic store, thank us for coming or trying to even make conversation about what a CHOCOLATE LONG JOHN was! Well anyway, we did buy an assortment of 6 donuts and they were fresh and good as always. Good donuts= Nasty, rude, uninviting, and four very abrasive Dunkin Donut employees. Not really worth a stop inside. Take pictures from outside and go buy your donuts from one of the other 200 Dunkin Donuts that you will see on your trip in and around Boston!!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-01-23T18:20:44-0500", "location_id": "4136591", "id": "191864532", "user": {"username": "Kim L", "user_location": {"name": "Naperville, Illinois", "id": "36422"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-12", "title": "Java at the original \"Double D\"", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60710-d4136591-r188245869-m11068-Dunkin_Donuts-Quincy_Massachusetts.html#review188245869", "text": "There's something historical about ordering a cup of coffee the the original Dunkin Donust shop.
