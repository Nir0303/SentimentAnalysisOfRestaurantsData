Local talent is also showcased as well, sometimes as the opening act for a national talent. The Nicole Henry performance brought the house down. Tall, sassy and very hip she is a powerhouse.

What a joke and embarrassment for an honorable blues legend. You guys should be ashamed! \nDid I mention the stage monitors also went out in the back 1/2 of the show??\nSpend the money and finish the job you started when you finally renovated this historic Theater....sound is critical in the performing arts....I won't be back until I read an announcement from the venue about an upgraded sound system.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Mickey M, Manager at Seminole Theatre, responded to this review", "text": "Dear Todd,\nThank you for taking the time to leave feedback.  It was very unfortunate that the sound system hit a snag at the end of that concert.  As you know, that's one of the pitfalls of live performances, but also what can make them exciting and memorable.  We're lucky that Charlie Musselwhite is such a pro and could keep it rocking.  \nFortunately the issues you mentioned are all related to just one problem that was immediately addressed and the sound system is working perfectly.  In addition, we're happy to report we  have been awarded a grant to significantly upgrade the sound system along with several other aspects of the live performance and building experience.
