This coffee is not like an african roast you get at commercial places like Starbucks. Even the dark roast tastes great..not like charcoal.For specialty drink, try a mocha profeta or ask the barrista because they want to make you happy. Smoothies are great and they use no ice or syrups. Local, organic and healthy focus. They also have local pastries etc to go with the coffee/smoothies.
