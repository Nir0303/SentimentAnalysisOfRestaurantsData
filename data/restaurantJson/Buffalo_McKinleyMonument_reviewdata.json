It is a 96 foot obelisk and at the base there are lions that sit around it. Everything is made out of marble and water pools are clean up close. It feels like a medium sized park and trees line the perimeter. Plenty of benches to sit and relax if you so choose. They also have boards around the area that gives you more historical info on buffalo. We wandered out there and was not disappointed. It was a cool place to get more info and during the summer when we were there it's a great place to beat the heat.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-14T06:39:43-0400", "location_id": "11691275", "id": "427882795", "user": {"username": "EvaLady", "user_location": {"name": "Hillsboro, Oregon", "id": "51907"}}}]}
