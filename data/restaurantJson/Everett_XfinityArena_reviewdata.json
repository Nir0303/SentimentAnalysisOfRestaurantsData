The concert itself was amazing; worth every penny and a speeding ticket getting there. The venue itself has a few things that need improvement.  Getting in to the venue takes quite some time due to their security measures.  We stood outside for quite a while waiting to get thru.  The acoustics are not the greatest.  I usually use earplugs at a concert to protect my hearing but at this one I took them out to hear the words. The seats were not what we expected either.  Based on the seating chart I assumed that they would sit above the stage in a balcony area a little more; however, we were across the arena with folks walking across the floor all evening.  The seats that we were in were also a little rickety and  lopsided.  I was so excited to be there that we made the best of it and enjoyed the concert to the fullest.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-29T12:44:31-0400", "location_id": "7194507", "id": "432745545", "user": {"username": "foto_monkey", "user_location": {"name": "Bountiful, Utah", "id": "56940"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Always fun to go to this venue", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58466-d7194507-r429524255-m11068-Xfinity_Arena-Everett_Washington.html#review429524255", "text": "I've come her for many different events.

First off, it's awesome to have this kind of arena in Everett. It's small enough that there are no bad seats, but large enough to attract some great venues. You also don't have to fight the Seattle traffic to get in and out of Everett. Fun places to eat of have a beer nearby too. \n\nA couple of things I didn't like. I'm 6'6'' tall. The seats are pretty close together and not a lot of leg room. I went with three other people and I'm probably the only one who isn't completely comfortable with the seating because of my long legs. \n\nXfinity Arena is also an ice rink for the Everett Silvertips (WHL) Ice hockey team. When there is a venue at the arena on the floor, they cover the ice rink up with heavy boards. My wife and I went to a theater production that was touring from New York and the best seats were on the floor over the ice rink. It got cold, even though the rink was fully covered. I don't think I would recommend having seats on the floor for a show. It's better in the stands. \n\nSo, I appreciate having the Arena, and those are my only two negative comments.
