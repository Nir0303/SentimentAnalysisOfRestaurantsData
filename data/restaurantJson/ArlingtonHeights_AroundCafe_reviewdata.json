Instant fall in love with it. From the sweet baristas to the amazing selection (Cafe Avocado anyone? Einsp\u00e4nner in your face, Starbucks!). \nIt has a nice vibe which I've experiences in similar places around East Asia. \nIt is local. \nGreat selections of coffees. The teas come from the highly respected Rishi line.\nYou prefer some boba instead? Check - they have unique combinations.\nI saw few baked goods (a croissant caught my eye for sure).\nOnce you done you can take home the memory with some of their coffees beans or the chocolate (I haven't tried it yet).\nThere is a nice ambiance and free WiFi.\nGets my full support!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-26T20:18:22-0400", "location_id": "11444297", "id": "422672204", "user": {"username": "evgeny", "user_location": {"name": "suburbia, IL", "id": null}}}]}
