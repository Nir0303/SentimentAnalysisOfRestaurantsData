I went with 2 friends of mine visiting from San Antonio that drove up to welcome me to Texas (I just moved here). I ordered a beer and gave the bartender my military dependant ID and he refused to take it and said he needed a driver license because the owner prefers them. I just got a new one so all I had was the paper print out the DMV gave me that was in my car. I brought it in, got my drink, and sat down. It was pretty dead, the music was meh, and they had a mixed crowd. I got up to get another drink this time just showing my paper print out of my new TX license. This bartender (different one) decided he didn't like it and that I'd need another ID, so I showed him my military ID. I don't know if those 2 guys were idiots or just rude but I will never go to that bar again. This is a college town filled with people from all over the world, chances are we're going to have a form of ID other than a driver license!
