Not too many customers inside, we were greeted promptly and seated in a comfortable spot. \n\nThis seems like a typical family or mom and pop type establishment. It seems to be run by family and they all do their jobs very well. From being super attentive to us (we had two small kids with us) or just being helpful, they were over the top nice. My granddaughter who is three and a half was super hungry and we were going to try an appetizer, but the older lady who was serving us asked if we would like her meal brought out first so she could get started on it. Yes, please!!! It made all the difference that my granddaughter got to eat before she really got cranky and hungry. After all, she wasn't going to be trying the caprese salad like we did.  \nOn that note, the Caprese Salad appetizer was delicious. The tomatoes could have been a bit riper, but overall it was delicious and tasty. Plenty to share as well. The house bread basket was interesting and sort of a blend of a garlic bread/foccacia. They serve you ice cold water in a charming way; out of wine bottles. It gives a touch of european elegance to an otherwise simply meal.\n\nFor the adults we bought the Ciao Special pizza, which has cappicola and sopressato salami in addition to a light tomato basil sauce. Crust was crispy and delicious, I am sure they make their dough in house due to it's flavor.  We also tried the cheese ravioli and linguine with clam sauce. All delicious and technically correct. The pasta in the ravioli dish as well as the linguine tasted house made and was well appreciated. \n\nWe saw they had desserts available and if we had shared more and ordered less we could have possibly tried some dessert, however we were all way too full and even took a lot home for lunch the next day.  For what you get, the prices are wonderful, three adults and two kids for less than $70 including tip.  Great deal, especially since we had an appetizer and we couldn't ask for better service.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a family atmosphere and good solid Italian food, try this place!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-04-16T20:22:21-0400", "location_id": "953121", "id": "266165737", "user": {"username": "fyremaven", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Lovely evening, great service, excellent food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33268-d953121-r264989399-m11068-Ciao_Italia_Ristorante-Whittier_California.html#review264989399", "text": "I found this restaurant on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try.

Now, they just opened their new restaurant & I held my 60th birthday party there (about 20 guests).  Everyone raved about the food & said they would return.  Service is phenomenal & the whole family helps out.

For me, it was an out-of-the-ordinary experience to live through.  I savored each bite to the last as if it were the first all over again!
