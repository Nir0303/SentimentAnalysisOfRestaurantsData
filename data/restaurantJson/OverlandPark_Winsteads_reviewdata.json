I hope they have more business during the week because even though winsteads is nothing special in the food department it is a local treasure unique to KC and I hope they are here forever. I had the traditional eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. The over easy eggs were perfect with a nice runny yolk that mixed perfectly with the crispy on the outside and steamy On the inside hash browns. The extra crispy bacon was flavorful and the coffee hot and my cup was always full. There are other more trendy places for breakfast in KC, but you can't go wrong with the simplicity of Winsteads.
