I was surprised at how neat and tidy it was inside. They sell johnson's corner cinnamon rolls out of a display. They have a selection of Mexican food and also hamburgers and cheeseburgers and fries. Everything is fresh. The food was very good. Especially considering that it's served in styrofoam. It could easily be served at a restaurant and the prices could be triple. The people working were very nice and helpful. The place was busy. We stopped on our way home from a kid's football game and I'm glad we did.
