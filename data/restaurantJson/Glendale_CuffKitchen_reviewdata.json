The place looks nice, very clean and a few distinct features within the atmosphere that makes it look better. Staff are doing a great job at work providing excellent customer service. This a restaurant that downtown Glendale should be treasuring.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-10-05T15:20:39-0400", "location_id": "7183942", "id": "316429104", "user": {"username": "Jacob E.

Happy Hour 3-6. Sat at a booth. It's in an old building dating to late 1800's. Neat ceiling, you can see some of the original brick. \n\nServed by Chris, one of the owners. No beers on tab but an interesting selection of bottles. Besides, Bud etc, Stone, Odells. I had a Nebraska Brewing Co. IPA, very good, and an AfterMath from a brewery in Temecula. Normally $5 they are $4 on Happy Hour. Pinot $4 Happy Hour but my wife wanted Moscato. $9 for an Italian one, a little pricey.\n\nWe had Deviled eggs as an appetizer ($5 Happy Hour), 6 with bacon. They were good. I had Fish Tacos Happy Hour $8. My wife had Pulled Pork $9 HH. Both were good.\n\nChris and his Dad, Dave said they are hoping to add taps soon which would be great and pull in more business. The Patio in the back looks nice but not in August.\n\nWill go back in October and check it out.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-23T14:32:22-0400", "location_id": "7183942", "id": "302642026", "user": {"username": "streykatt", "user_location": {"name": "Glendale, Arizona", "id": "31231"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "I am sure there are better places near here", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31231-d7183942-r300754355-m11068-Cuff_Kitchen-Glendale_Arizona.html#review300754355", "text": "My mother and I went on a Monday afternoon for lunch. The place is very cute, has a lot of character. \nI can only assume the manager/owner was in a business meeting at the first booth when you walk in. When he noticed there was no one there he sat us at a table. It took roughly 10 minutes for the server to even acknowledged us and at that point there was only one other table..\nThe food was I would say less than average. I ordered the steak burger with no top bun and with salad. My mom ordered the eggplant parm sandwich. I asked for my steak burger to be cooked medium well and it was definitely not medium well. My mom's seemed to be all bread and two very paper thin pieces of eggplant parm. The server was nice but you could tell he was busy. I found it odd that the manager/owner did not offer any assistance to his sole server. I probably wont be back and if I do, I will sit at the bar.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-18T10:21:39-0400", "location_id": "7183942", "id": "300754355", "user": {"username": "travelswithfashion", "user_location": {"name": "Phoenix, Arizona", "id": "31310"}}}]}
