It began indoors in a small strip mall near their offices. The guide did the usual introductions and then launched into a 15-20 min presentation on the history of New Mexico. All of the people on the tour started enthusiastic to go on the walking tour, bundled up in warm clothes (it was about 29 degrees out), but after a short time, everyone started to grab seats on the indoor benches and take off their coats. It was clear we were in for a much longer talk than expected, and as of this point, did zero walking.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes, we headed outside. Yay! Everyone bundled up again and we walked... across the street. To a plaque. Where the guide had us all stand still in the freezing cold and talked another 20-30 minutes about more history of New Mexico and and the old west. All throughout promising to \"show\" us the historical points he was referencing later in the tour. Everyone was freezing and visibly bored, shifting, and even taking pictures around them while the guide continued to talk. \n\nAt this point, about an hour had passed and we had literally only waked across the street and stared at a plaque. My anxiety over the fact that this tour only had 30 more minutes to go (and we had only about an hour left in the town before WE needed to begin driving to our next destination), my husband and I decided to try to get the guide's attention (to no avail, since he didn't really pay attention to any of us) and just quietly walked away from the tour group down the block. We forfeited our fee and spent the next hour visiting the main square, a few galleries, the basilica, had some coffee and french tarts at the french bakery and took pictures. \n\nI'm not sure if there are multiple guides, but the one we had that day seemed to be somewhat out of touch with the group.
