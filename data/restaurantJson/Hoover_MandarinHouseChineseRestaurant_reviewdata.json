It's just down the road from me, and the combination fried rice is delicious (and is enough for two, three people easily). They have a lot of \"unique\" dishes compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area. the Tien Tien Beef is particularly good, though they put a lot of veggies in it and not that much beef. Their Hot and Sour Soup is... interesting. It's not like a sweet/sour sauce that you'd expect, but almost like the sour from fermented veggies. It's very filling, though, so maybe only get that if you intend to share. All their soup is made to order (and serves two people), too, so it's nice and hot when you get it. \n\nMy preferred entrees are, in order, the Seafood Sizzling Rice (a delicious medely of shrimp, scallops, and crab over \"sizzling\" rice, which seems to be just puffed rice), Sesame Chicken, and Tien Tien Beef. The Sesame Chicken is good, plump chunks of chicken, not little crumbs of crust with something like chicken skin in the middle. As I said before, the Tien Tien Beef is delicious, but a bit too much veg in it for my taste. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in Hoover looking for good Chinese.
