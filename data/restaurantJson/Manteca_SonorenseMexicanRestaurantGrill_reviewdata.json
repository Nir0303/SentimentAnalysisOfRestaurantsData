The kitchen seems to be taking up most of the interior space and the eating area kind of wraps around it in an L-shape, leaving not much space inside for dining.  They do have a decent courtyard in back where you can eat, weather permitting.  During summer, it is so hot most times that I'd be surprised if it gets much use outside of cool evenings.\n\nThe menu is a hodgepodge of cuisines with Mexican, American and even a little Italian thrown in, so I'm not sure exactly what they're going for.\n\nI ordered a burrito and while it was decent, it was certainly not worth $8+ that I was charged.  The chips and salsa were good.  I wasn't too pleased with getting charged $2+ for a can of soda.  If you're going to do cans of soda at a restaurant, please overcharge customers unless you're allowing them unlimited cans.\n\nI think a lunch menu would be a good idea for this restaurant with more reasonable prices.  I probably won't be back here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-07-18T15:31:46-0400", "location_id": "10592720", "id": "394106483", "user": {"username": "BigD_CA", "user_location": {"name": "Northern California", "id": null}}}]}
