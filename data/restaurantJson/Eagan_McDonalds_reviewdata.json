Spilled ketchup, wrappers, etc.  Not really surprised by this part - but what stood out to me was when I started getting some ketchup - it was not good.  It actually came out in my cup a two-toned color and very, very watery - not sure if watered down to try and save money - but I was not impressed.\n\nGot my big mac, ketchup even tasted off - like watered down ketchup - don't recall this type of experience at other McD - but perhaps you have.  Didn't even finish my sandwich - fries were not very hot and slightly overcooked.  Saw another woman eating and the middle of her burger was pretty pink/undercooked.\n\nSo, I guess not all McDonalds are alike - normally yes, but not this one. \n\nProbably will not be back.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-10-27T12:21:49-0400", "location_id": "1080170", "id": "236604119", "user": {"username": "hotelguychris", "user_location": {"name": "Twin Cities, MN", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2013-02", "title": "Bad food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43022-d1080170-r154561819-m11068-McDonald_s-Eagan_Minnesota.html#review154561819", "text": "My husband and I went there for a quick meal.
