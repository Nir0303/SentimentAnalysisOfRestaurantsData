Amid all the heavy starchy pasta, enchilada, pizza & burger food downtown offers, here is a refreshing little gem where you can get a salad, fruit cup, or fresh squeezed juice to go.  My first visit for lunch I ordered the turkey crepe with tomato pesto. It was scrumptious & light.  I sipped on citrus infused water as I waited.  My friend & I stopped here for fruit cups the other day when it was hot.  The fruits were cut up as we watched.  Fresh, cool & crispy, so good and large cups too.  They offer fresh fruit crepes as well, smoothies - OMyGosh - the chalkboard menu goes on & on. Many choices & combos.  Check it out while strolling downtown.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-20T12:04:55-0400", "location_id": "10083837", "id": "357097823", "user": {"username": "KauaiSalt", "user_location": {"name": "Aloha", "id": null}}}]}
