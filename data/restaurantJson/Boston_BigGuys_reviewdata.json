In the mood for a falafel sandwich, they put together a wrap, my first falafel wrap. Great sandwich with all the trimmings. Now comes the question. If you eat in you can add more hot sauce as you work through the sandwich. If you get it to go you can only add so much hot sauce to the first bites then you run dry later in the sandwich. To go or eat in? Next time, I eat in. How come it is called Big Guys? Because the dad is bigger than the rest of the family he answers with a shrug. Great family dynamics in this place. Check it out.
