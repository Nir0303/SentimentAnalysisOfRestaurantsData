The calamari was tough like leather! We also ordered their fresh salmon and Dungeness crab \ud83e\udd80 which was fantastic!! Recommend it to anyone who loves seafood! A third dish we tried was the Peking duck with plum sauce and dumplings!! It was tasty and worth investigating!! \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-28T10:35:08-0400", "location_id": "487540", "id": "432464083", "user": {"username": "Kansasdj", "user_location": {"name": "Peoria, Arizona", "id": "31308"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "5 stars on food and view!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d487540-r432263639-m11068-Portland_City_Grill-Portland_Oregon.html#review432263639", "text": "If you have anyone coming out of town for a visit and they want to see Portland, this is the place to take them!  The restaurant sits high above the US Bank tower and the views are breath-taking.  I've only been to the bar side because they have one of the best happy hours in my opinion.   Happy hour runs Monday thru Saturday from 4pm to 7pm and then again 9pm to close.  Sundays it's noon to close. You can choose from a mix of American or Asian cuisine.  Some of my favorites are the Poblano Mac & Cheese, Kung Pao Calamari, Spicy Chili-garlic Pork Riblets and Grilled Steak House Cheeseburger.  Prices for food range from $4.95 to $10.95.  They also have drink specials as well.  Sometimes they have a piano player which adds to the atomophere.  For those who go frequent they now offer a rewards card where you recieved points for dining there and then can be easily redeemed towards food.  They do have parking in the building and will validate your parking for you making it free.  The wait staff is a little slow at times and the place can get very crowded.  Seating in the bar is first come first serve and the place does get busy.  There are booths all along the perimeter, but the coveted spots are the ones right by the big windows with city views.  There is also seating around the piano as well as at the bar in the middle of the room.  Of course you can always make reservations in the dining room as well, however prices are a little more.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-27T15:19:43-0400", "location_id": "487540", "id": "432263639", "user": {"username": "Mia P", "user_location": {"name": "Vancouver, Washington", "id": "60820"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Great views ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d487540-r432164688-m11068-Portland_City_Grill-Portland_Oregon.html#review432164688", "text": "Can be very difficult to get a window seat at happy hour.
