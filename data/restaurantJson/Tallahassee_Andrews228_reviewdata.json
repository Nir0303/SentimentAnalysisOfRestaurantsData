The places that are a bit pricey (nothing completely outrageous) and somewhere you would probably want to dress up a little for? The places that exemplify \"downtown dining\"?\n\nAndrew's 228 is one of a handful of places like this that Tallahassee has to offer. (To be honest, Tallahassee doesn't offer much to begin with).\n\nAnyways, my wife and I had dinner here last night. Here is how it went:\n\nParking was a bit of a worry, through no fault of Andrew's 228. We suffered brain flatulence and forgot that our reservations for dinner were around the time of the Downtown Get-Down. The price of parking at Kleman Plaza was jacked up and the garage was filling fast.\n\nWhat should have been a pleasant stroll to Andrew's a couple blocks away ended up being a feat in navigating through a sea of stupidity. There are times that you just want to yell out \"get out of my way\", but common sense kicks in as you realize that doing so in a crowd of a bunch of drunks and college kids (sometimes one-in-the-same) would be a terrible idea. \n\nThe sea of idiots got worse right next to Andrew's 228 ... where Andrew's Capital Bar and Grill is (right next door to 228).\n\nNone of this is through Andrew's fault ... just know that things are going to be a little crazy here if you come on certain Fridays during college football season.\n\nInside, however, was another matter. It was nice and quiet (in other words, hardly anyone was there). We probably didn't even need to have reservations, but just so you know, they do take reservations (unlike MOST restaurants in Tallahassee that either have never allowed reservations or have phased out the practice of reservations to this call-ahead waiting malarkey).\n\nWe were promptly seated. The restaurant looked nice and more up-to-date than not (unlike Georgio's, which looks like it fell through a time warp from the 80's). The service was pleasant; the hostess was polite and friendly, and the waiter was very nice ... checking on our table an appropriate amount of times (not too little and not too much ... and there is a such thing as too much).\n\nWe started with drinks ... the wife had water (typical), and I had a water and an adult beverage \"Bananas Foster\" ... flavored much like the dessert. The drink was actually a decent value. Most places would charge more for their cocktails.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer ... bacon-wrapped scallops. They tasted good (and were presented nicely), however I am really glad there were no more in our party than just my wife and I. When the appetizer got to the table, there were only 3 scallops (and the little half-dollar sized pancake that came with it) on the plate. We thought the price of the appetizer was pretty fair WHEN WE ORDERED IT; however, I would argue that the value changed once we received it at the table. At least we had the complimentary bread (very good by the way, and sports a variety of breads) to keep us busy.\n\nNext up, entrees. The wife had the dijon brie chicken, while I had the bronzed snapper. Both entrees came with smashed potatoes. From what I tasted of her meal, it was pretty good. The dijon sauce had great flavor to it. As for my snapper, it was decent. Sadly, most of the flavor on my plate came from the squash noodles. The whole dish was screaming for salt; however, there was no salt to be seen on the table. The was a pepper mill, but no salt shaker.\n\nI know a lot of places want to limit salt consumption. I can make that decision for myself, thank you very much. Especially in a state like Florida, where it seems that more and more restaurants cook their food as bland as can be in order to please senior citizens that have dietary restrictions. I am not a senior citizen; I can still have seasoned food. \n\nAs you can tell, this is my biggest gripe with our meal / experience. I probably could have asked for salt, and they may have brought some out (though I have been to some places that wouldn't), but I shouldn't have to. Salt should be on the table. It isn't an insult to your chef if the food isn't seasoned to my personal liking. However, it IS an insult to me as a paying customer to have something so simple as salting my food taken away from me.\n\nStepping down from the soapbox ....\n\nAfter the entrees, we (I) ordered a dessert: their bread pudding. It was a pumpkin and white chocolate bread pudding. Easily the best part of the meal. Came with (cinnamon, I believe) ice cream.\n\nOverall, nice atmosphere, quiet, food is good (not great) and pleasant staff. Only bad part was the NO SALT part.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-09-05T17:00:36-0400", "location_id": "577505", "id": "307344928", "user": {"username": "Andrew P", "user_location": {"name": "Tallahassee, Florida", "id": "34675"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Great find", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34675-d577505-r307149090-m11068-Andrew_s_228-Tallahassee_Florida.html#review307149090", "text": "This establishment was very accomodating for a large party - 14!.
