However, I have stopped going there as much because there are some staff members (male) who are very rude. You get nasty attitude when you place your order and nasty attitude when you pick it up (not even delivery). I rather pay extra and go somewhere with better service. I hate writing bad reviews so I just gave it an average rating.
