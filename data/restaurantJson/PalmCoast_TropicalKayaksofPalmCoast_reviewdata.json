Signed our releases, a few instructions and off we went. I am a novice paddle border, unlike my son, so we didn't venture too far. Mostly stayed in the canals of the adjoining neighborhood. Probably would have seen more wildlife if we used the intercostal to adventure into other areas. Great way to start your day - peaceful, slow paced and on the water. Two hours was just the right amount of time. Anything longer and we would have been exhausted for the rest of our day.
