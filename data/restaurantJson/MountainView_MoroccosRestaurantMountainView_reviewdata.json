Why? Read on.\n\nThe wife had gotten a $20 Groupon coupon for $12 for take out only at the Morocco restaurant on Castro near the corner of El Camino Real.\n\nI called up at 4:05pm the day after New Years and ordered a $20 lamb tagine (stew)  and $22 beef tagine dishes take out, and the server is friendly and clear, and told me to come in 15 minutes.\n\n15 minutes later I'm at the counter, place is empty, credit card out, and the food comes out piping hot in two take out boxes.   Good service, great atmosphere, friendly helpful employees, with white cloth tables, clean colorful carpet, and view of downtown Mountain View through the large windows.    \n\nAt home, I cook brown rice and broccoli, and reheat the lamb and beef dishes. \n\nSome reviews have mentioned the portions being too small.  Well here's one thing we can't do in the restaurant but can do with take out: I weigh the meats, without the sauces, bones, and vegetables.  6 ounces of lamb, and 14 ounces of beef.\n\nThe lamb comes with a yellow curry sauce, potatoes, onions, and carrots, and is delicious -so tender it falls off the bone.\n\nThe tender, shredded beef comes with apricots and nuts in a very sweet sauce.  My wife's favorite!  BTW the wife doesn't like couscous, which is the standard addition with the meat dishes.    \n\nThe wife and I together eat half of each dish, with the other half being dinner two days from now.  So the portion sizes are more than ample, even for $20+ apiece.  \n\nI would have forgone the $8 in Groupon savings to ogle those dancing ladies at the Morocco, starting at 730pm.  But my wife wears the pants in the house, unlike those scantily clad belly dancers!   \n\nAnd Trump, I would definitely make an exception for any scantily clad Muslim belly dancers trying to enter the country -after all they have no place to hide any weapons. \n\nThis would be the place for a first date or a romantic date, or a date to impress, and definitely not the place for a breakup date -too expensive!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-01-07T19:09:32-0500", "location_id": "2203901", "id": "338332154", "user": {"username": "robert c", "user_location": {"name": "Sunnyvale, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Quirky and Good!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32761-d2203901-r327733575-m11068-Morocco_s_Restaurant_Mountain_View-Mountain_View_California.html#review327733575", "text": "The dining experience was enriched by the treatment received from our wait staff - a bit quirky but endearing!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-11-18T19:06:31-0500", "location_id": "2203901", "id": "327733575", "user": {"username": "RLAMyers", "user_location": {"name": "Oneonta, New York", "id": "48333"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "great lunch spot", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32761-d2203901-r322766576-m11068-Morocco_s_Restaurant_Mountain_View-Mountain_View_California.html#review322766576", "text": "Stopped in for lunch, sat on the huge outside patio, had the lunch special set menu.
