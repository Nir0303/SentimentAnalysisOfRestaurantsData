The check-in process was fast, staff was friendly.  Our room was wonderful, comfortable bed, great shower and lots of comfortable easy chairs and sofa.  Now to the things that needed attention:  AC and breakfast.  The AC thermostat was located by the entry door and the vents were above the bed, so if you set the thermostat at 74, it would be about 65 in bed.  Not an easy fix for this issue.  The breakfast fix is an easy one.  Breakfast begins at 7 am, which is too late for any day.  There were several people that were waiting to have breakfast and had to wait for the doors to open.  To top it off, they didn't open the doors until a few minutes after 7. Might sound picky, but if you are in town for a swim meet where your grandson swims at 7:30, it doesn't give you much time to have breakfast and get to the meet.  Breakfast should never begin later than 6:30.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "CarolynMurphy, General Manager at Residence Inn Minneapolis Plymouth, responded to this review", "text": "Dear Lakefantoo,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your positive experience at our hotel on TripAdvsior!

Salt water chlorination also produces less chloramines, which compromise air quality in an indoor pool setting. Chloramines can be very irritating to people, especially those with chlorine sensitivities. Most guests find that our pool is less harsh than traditionally chlorinated pools and that they do not experience red, irritated eyes and skin after swimming. We hope you have the opportunity to utilize the pool the next time you stay with us, and you can tell us what you think.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you back on your next retreat!
