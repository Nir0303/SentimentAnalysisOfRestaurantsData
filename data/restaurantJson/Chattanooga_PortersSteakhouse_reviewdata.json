Not quite a \"Morton's\", but in my opinion what Steakhouse is...?  Porter's will give any high-end end Steakhouse a run for their money and end up in the top five of anyone's review.  I had a N.Y. Strip and my wife had a filet.  Both were prepared to our specifications and were very flavorably (is that even a word??) tender.  Can't wait to head back south to dine there again.  May even stay at the Read House-but that would be another review...\n...", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-03T17:27:20-0400", "location_id": "827501", "id": "401083202", "user": {"username": "JHMCCLURE", "user_location": {"name": "Coshocton, Ohio", "id": "50239"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Great for a nice, quiet lunch or a business lunch.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54946-d827501-r400436824-m11068-Porter_s_Steakhouse-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html#review400436824", "text": "Porters has not only a selection of fine dining but has a $10 lunch special that is fantastic.

Really, who wishes to view another patrons toe jam and hairy legs for the occasion; attempt at fine dining....  The bar is average in craft and and carriage to create. To cut to the chase, this is a mid-level steak house that has seen better times.  With a new owner in the wings, I am sure the House Restaurant is ready for resurrection....  I know that Chattanooga is prime for that occasion to be fruit.  Hardly anyone from Nooga dines here, other than a post work cocktail.....", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-30T05:55:21-0400", "location_id": "827501", "id": "399151947", "user": {"username": "MDFS333", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}]}
