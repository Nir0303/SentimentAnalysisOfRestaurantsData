At various times, she served as guest professor at the Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg (HFBK Hamburg), the Knowlton School of Architecture at Ohio State University, the Masters Studio at Columbia University, and was the a Visiting Professor of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. \nHadid was named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Zaha was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 2004. \n\nShe died in Miami this year, so the world will not see more buildings from her. \n\nWe are very fortunate to have her work here in the heart of Cincinnati. She built on a terrific tradition in Cincinnati for the modern art: The Contemporary Arts Center was founded as the Modern Art Society in 1939, 60 years before her proposal for the new art center. \nThis new location came live in 2003.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-16T13:53:47-0500", "location_id": "274054", "id": "437920691", "user": {"username": "ACtryAMnth", "user_location": {"name": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Appreciate Art", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60993-d274054-r437223331-m11068-Contemporary_Arts_Center-Cincinnati_Ohio.html#review437223331", "text": "When I lasted visited The Contemporary Arts Center, I learned of children's educational programs that as a parent found interesting.
