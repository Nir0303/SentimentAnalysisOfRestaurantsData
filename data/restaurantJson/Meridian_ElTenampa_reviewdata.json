The bean dip they give you with your chips was really good.  Generally it is on the bland side, but not at El Tenampa.  I had the chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco.  Yum!  The taco was fabulous, lots of flavor.  I would recommend this restaurant if you are anywhere in the area and are having a craving for Mexican fare.  I would definetly return when visiting Boise.  I look forward to doing so during dinner so that I can try a margarita!!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2012-08-31T20:36:09-0400", "location_id": "411179", "id": "139033624", "user": {"username": "kandjOregon", "user_location": {"name": "Oregon", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Friendly place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35531-d411179-r23415777-m11068-El_Tenampa-Meridian_Idaho.html#review23415777", "text": "The food is OK but the service has always been good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2009-01-09T14:37:53-0500", "location_id": "411179", "id": "23415777", "user": {"username": "outacal", "user_location": {"name": "Idaho", "id": null}}}]}
