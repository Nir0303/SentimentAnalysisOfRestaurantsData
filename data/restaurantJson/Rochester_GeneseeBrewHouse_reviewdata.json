Founded in 1878, The Genesee Brewing Company is one of the largest and oldest continually operating breweries in the United States, producing the Genesee line of beers, including the iconic Genesee, Genny Light and the original Genesee Cream Ale. The Genesee Brewing Company is part of North American Breweries. \n\nThe Genesee Brew House was originally called Building #9, the bottling plant, but it has now transformed its 9,200 square-foot industrial space, over a hundred years old, into a beer destination, featuring interactive exhibits, multimedia content, gift shop, pilot brewery and pub-style restaurant. The Brew House was created to capture and share with you the long history of The Genesee Brewery - one of the largest and oldest continually operating breweries in America. But the Brewery itself isn't half as interesting as the beer and the people who make it.\n\nThe displays and gift shop are on the first floor along with a tasting area and below that, the actual \"Pilot Brewing\" apparatus. Food is served on the second floor and there is an elevator for those who need one and for food to be brought up to the small, open kitchen stuck in a corner behind supplies. The 40 foot bar constructed from barrels was three-deep when we arrived on a Friday afternoon! Perhaps the patrons were celebrating the end of the acrimonious election on the previous Tuesday. \"Pilot Batch\" craft brews are made at the restaurant, and for those wishing to sample, beer flights are available.\n\nWe both had Santa Fe salads with Genny beer of course but I also tried a \"Rocktoberfest\" craft beer - dark and quite pungent. The place was busy and loud, very loud. There is a terrace where one can view the Genesee River cascading over a falls in the middle of the city.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-16T06:54:56-0500", "location_id": "3497245", "id": "437812051", "user": {"username": "Mike K", "user_location": {"name": "Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada", "id": "154999"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Unique establishment featuring High Falls Brewing beers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48503-d3497245-r437590869-m11068-Genesee_Brew_House-Rochester_Finger_Lakes_New_York.html#review437590869", "text": "Good bar food, burgers, salads etc. If dining outside on the terrace, great view of the falls.
