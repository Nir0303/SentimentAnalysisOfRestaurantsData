We had a family dinner for seven and had many dishes - Seafood Tofu Soup, Shredded Pork with Bean Sprouts over Pan Fried Noodles, green beans with beef, pot stickers, Moo Shu Pork, fried chicken wings and steamed pork with salted fish (which is not on the menu but they will prepare on request). Everything was prepared very well and served piping hot - the same way it has been served for many years.  The meal was enjoyed by the entire family, even the two small children.  We hope to continue to visit this restaurant for many years to come.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-19T19:15:43-0500", "location_id": "4617965", "id": "333952522", "user": {"username": "BrandingExpert", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Very crowded with Asians, a good sign", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58349-d4617965-r331521619-m11068-Toys_Chinese_Cafe_and_Bakery-Bellevue_Washington.html#review331521619", "text": "Had combos.
