I've been working in downtown Worcester for the last few weeks so I looked for a place to eat lunch close by.  We found the Midtown Dinette tucked inside the Midtown mall by City Hall off Main and Front streets.  They serve breakfast all day (6-3) but it is their lunch specials I really like.  Fridays fish 'n chips was Great, not to mention the extra large piece if fish.  Monday they had stuffed peppers, honest, 2 even, almost too much to eat.  Today, election day, I had the homemade chicken soup and chicken parm over pasta.  I tell you, i'm gonna gain 20 lbs if I keep eating here.  Might have to try the salads for the rest of the week, they look good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-11-06T09:13:29-0500", "location_id": "385262", "id": "144775582", "user": {"username": "ChefZeus", "user_location": {"name": "Oxford, Massachusetts", "id": "41758"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": null, "title": "Ditch the paper plates.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41952-d385262-r25922782-m11068-Midtown_Dinette-Worcester_Massachusetts.html#review25922782", "text": "Sorry,but I was a regular for a few weeks until they switched to serving the food on paper plates.
