But when I made my trip out to Minnesota, I wanted a kitchen, so I decided to risk it. \n\nI didn't even get to see the nightly prices because I booked as a package, but it seems to have come out to around $53/night. \n\nYou get what you pay for.\n\nThe only kitchen items they had were at the front desk. The only pots and pans they had were scratched teflon coated ones. Those are poisonous!! You are supposed to throw those out if they get scratched. No wonder cancer rates are so high.\n\nThe smell is like a diaper pail full of dirty diapers. In the hallway, in the rooms. I don't know if the smell is coming through the walls or the pipes, but it is really not pleasant.\n\nThe beds are uncomfortable.You only get 3 basic thin pillows on the bed, and a few hangers in the \"closet\" Of course that wasn't enough for me, but they didnt' have any more at the front desk.\n\nTheir \"continental breakfast\" -- Travelocity stated on their website (which is where I booked this trip through) that they had complimentary continental breakfast -- includes a granola bar and coffee!! Two things I do not put in my body! I wanted juice, that is all, because I to mix it with a greens drink powder that I brought with me. If I had known it was not going to be a continental breakfast, I could have stopped on the way to the hotel to pick something up. But my first morning staying there was a disaster.\n\nOther travelers are gross. I think this type of hotel caters to those who don't shower much or don't work??? They smoke, watch loud TV, don't go to bed at normal hours, etc. I am fine with that, I don't mean to judge, except when it affects others, then it is not ok. \n\nIt was not a pleasant experience at all. \n\nAnd it is my fault for not booking a nicer hotel. I just was thinking about the kitchen, haha what a joke. Oh, my faucet in the kitchen sink just turns and turns.... so you never know when it is going on or off (the hot water faucet).\n\nFor $50/night? Definitely not worth it... maybe for $25/night it would have been worth it, equivalent to a hostel. But I know better for next time I am in the Twin Cities for work. \n\nIt is not worth it!

The room was adequately clean. It could have defiantly had more deep cleaning but not worth any complaints. There was an issue with my Expedia reservation where the night I came into town I did not have a room. The front desk worked with me and got me a room for the night and told me the rest of my stay would be under the Expedia reservation. After I came back from my business of the day they informed me that my Expedia reservation was gone out of their system and I would have to pay again to stay. They would not help in figuring out why the reservation disappeared and told me to deal with it myself and I would need to speak with their manager the next day. I had to spend at least an hour on the phone with all parties to fix the problem and the front desk fixed the error but with an attitude that they made no error.

We left the room and returned to the front desk with our belongings to request a new room. The clerk was definitely inconvenienced by us, and our request, but reluctantly obliged. Our \"new\" room wasn't much better. There were onion skin remnants in the fridge drawer, nasty comforters, and crinkled bed sheets which makes me believe the bedding was never laundered from the previous occupant. The bed was just remade. The smoke alarm was hanging from the ceiling by a cord, and the hairdryer in the bathroom was hanging half way down where the screws had stripped from the wall.

Stainless has to be polished, at least with a dry cloth. The carpet in the corridors was frayed and dirty. There was also a dirty, greasy smell filling these corridors. Supposed to be a self catering unit with a two burner hotplate but there were no utensils, plates, pans etc. Fridge was old as was the furniture in the room. My bathroom sink would only drain slowly and filled up with water. The towels were tiny and the roughest I've ever felt in a hotel. My wash cloth had yellow stains on it. And to cap it all off was the 'Grab and go breakfast'. This is a cheap marketing way of saying we don't supply breakfast. When you get up or leave (the latter is recommended), in the lobby you make yourself a Kuerig coffee (with powdered creamer), and are offered a granola bar and muffin. That's it. Plus there is nowhere to sit anyway. I certainly won't be looking at staying in this brand of hotel again. If they don't want to spend money here, then save the effort and just close it down.
