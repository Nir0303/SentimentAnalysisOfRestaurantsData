They gave us complimentary chips and fresh made salsa that was unique but tasty. We started out with fresh tasting fish tacos that were tasty and similar to fish tacos I had in Mexico. The entrees wowed us the most. They both were so fresh tasting and delicious. I had the wrapped fish. The fish was cooked with seasonings, onions and peppers. The fish was so fresh tasting and prepared perfect. It came with fresh hot and steamy tortillas nicely seasoned rice and a salad garnish with seasoned ripe avocado. I thought it was also a big fat bargain for only $11.95. My husband had the Spicy Shrimp and he was just as delighted as I was. Service was great too. The atmosphere isn't there yet but you can sit at a comfortable booth or table and get very good food. Hard to find because previous restaurant's sign is up and you don't see their name unless you look at the window.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-10T15:14:36-0400", "location_id": "10531540", "id": "391164149", "user": {"username": "TheSaltyPepper", "user_location": {"name": "Phoenix, Arizona", "id": "31310"}}}]}
