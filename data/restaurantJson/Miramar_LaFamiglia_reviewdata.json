The place is very laid back and not over the top, two good qualities I look for when dining at a place that prides itself in selling authentic Italian food.\n\nThe menu has plenty of choices, and pretty much all of the dishes I have had have been really good. The pizza is huge and delicious, you can really tell the sauce is prepared fresh in the restaurant using high quality ingredients. Furthermore, it is a really great value for what you get.\n\nMy favorite, however, has to be the pasta, especially the penne arrabiatta. Penne arrabiatta has to be my favorite pasta dish of all time, and it is one that is not so easily found in US restaurants, especially one that it is well prepared. It is for that reason that I was pretty pleased when I saw the restaurant offered it, and even more when I tried it and realized it was one of the better ones I have had in the country. It has the right amount of spice and the consistency is more crushed tomatoes than an actual sauce, just as it should be.\n\nI come to this restaurant pretty often, and would recommend it to anyone that is interested in getting a less American version of Italian food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-21T03:59:31-0400", "location_id": "2453775", "id": "291016856", "user": {"username": "fcbarcelona101", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, Florida", "id": "34515"}}}]}
