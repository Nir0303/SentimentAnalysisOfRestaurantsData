I purposefully ordered a steak burrito combo. Upon receiving the order I proceeded to open the burrito very carefully to find out the ratio of meat versus the rest. I was more than disappointed when I counted the tiny bit of beef, which could have been more than an oz all together, and the large servings of the rest: rice, beans, etc. This is what separates a seriously good place from a money making formula. Yes, they are slightly better than other mexican franchises like del taco, taco bell (notice I am not bothering with capital letters? Is my way of showing contempt to the big corporations and my bad taste for going there). I also tried their fish tacos and have to say that there is nothing south of the border on these offerings. Rare is the place that will serve you fare that is above average. Across the street In and Out was booming with people coming and going. Why? Because they serve a product that does not deviate in quality, quantity and price.\nRubio was popularized by the illusive image of baja and the beautiful pacific ocean. These are great images to associate with their business, but in reality Rubio makes slightly better beans, better sauces than the competition. Their food is mediocre and the reason this location does good is because it attends to the mall traffic. Seriously, I counted maybe ten miniature pieces of beef that amounted to no more than an oz of beef, it that. That is the model for this eatery, and come to think of it, for most places. Very little meat, lots of everything else.
