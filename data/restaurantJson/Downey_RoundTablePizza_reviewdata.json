However this one was just built not too long ago and I thought GREAT, Im gonna head on over.. I did and woah.. flat pizza.. no taste and even the specialty one I like was nasty. i thought maybe it was just that one visit so I went again on another day months after and it was the same. certainly not worth the 40$ I paid.

I took my 15 year old grandson there recently, and we enjoyed fairly decent pizza. There wasn't a big crowd so all you haveto do is wait for thecookingtime of the pizza. Would I return? To be honest I tried the place before with my wife who didn't think Round Table had the best pizza.
