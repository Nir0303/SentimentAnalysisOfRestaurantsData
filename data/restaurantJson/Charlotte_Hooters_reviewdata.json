We originally were going to eat somewhere else but they didn't start serving until 5pm and we arrived around 4:30. Hooters was right next door so we opted for there as we were on a time crunch. Should have gotten a hint when it was happy hour and there were only 2 people at the bar and one other table in the whole restaurant. \n\nUpon entering we were seated right away and given our drinks. My dad ordered the grilled fish tacos and a side salad. I ordered the buffalo chicken tacos and side salad. Salads never came out before but with meal. Once the food arrived, my dads tacos were fried and not grilled. Both of our salads were inedible because of bad lettuce and vegetables. My dad asked for another salad to be made and I asked for onion rings since it was the same price (.99 up charge). After manager made a new salad it was a little better but still not acceptable. After waiting about 8 minutes for the onion rings, they came out and were inedible as well. Full of grease and soggy. Did not even eat one whole piece. Our waitress was more than accommodating while we had these issues. Spoke with manager again and explained what was going on and couldn't eat salads THEN couldn't eat onion rings. They said they would adjust our bill accordingly. \n\nOnce getting the check, they never took anything off. I am not one to accept comps if something goes wrong but after multiple chances to get our food right, we did not expect to pay for a salad that didn't get eaten OR onion rings that were not edible. Also, the manager did not know his menu. When the onion rings were not taken off and then charged us $5, he said they were more expensive to add as a side. It clearly states that you can add a side salad, onion rings, tater tots for a .99 up charge. \n\nThey had already run my dads card when we thought the check was taken care of the first time. Now, it's close to 6pm which is the start of the baseball game we were going to. We had been in the restaurant close to an hour and a half because of this mess. They couldn't figure out how to refund the first transaction and then run the second. When they brought the fixed second check it was still incorrect because they charged a side salad as $2.99 instead of the .99. \n\nWe finally got out of there and will never EVER return. We don't hardly ever go to Hooters establishments and this is just another reason not to go. \n\nAs a positive, tacos were descent and waitress really did try to be positive throughout the whole fiasco.
