Hall is impressive size. Before hall is been confirmed Brad and Stefani were the nicest people in the world. On party day it was a terrible experience. Charged double than what was quoted initially. Supplies at food counters are not enough. Staff got upset when asked for extra plates and spoons. Not cooperative with outside catering. All through the party in several interactions staff was very unpleasant. At the end while my friend went to pay the bill 1000 dollars changed to 2200? \"You can't leave the hall without paying this\" These are the exact words they used. Disrespectful and unacceptable. Other than hall size and location - I will not recommend this hall for any parties just because of staff behavior. Bottom-line - \"They can't get referrals from current customers with this kind of attitude and behaviors\"!! Unfortunately terrible rating is all because of staff, nothing else.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-08-20T12:01:37-0400", "location_id": "5032237", "id": "223241850", "user": {"username": "Venkataraman P", "user_location": {"name": "Madison, Mississippi", "id": "43869"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Great Paninis", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30488-d5032237-r185892478-m11068-The_Loft_On_Foster-Dothan_Alabama.html#review185892478", "text": "Formerly Colby's -- now The Loft is a great place to stop & get lunch.
