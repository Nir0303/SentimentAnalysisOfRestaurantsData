My wife ordered the chicken chow fun dinner ($8.95, with about 3/4\"-wide noodles rather than the thin noodes of chow mein), while I ordered the kung pan fish filet dinner with fried rice.  Both dinners came with soup, we chose the very good hot and sour soup.  The entrees arrived in about 20 minutes and turned our to be huge portions, especially the chow fun.  We ate most of the fish but hardly touched the chow mein (which we took home for dinner the next night).  The fish was slightly spicy, just right for our tastes, and was not a single filet, as I had expected, but small, larget than bite-size pieces.  The fish was in a very tasty thick brown sauce, with mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green peppers, and tiny very hot red peppers   Both dishes were very good.  The restaurant does not have a wine list.  When we asked the waitress what was available, she told us \"only cabernet sauvignon.''  We would have preferred a white wine with chicken and fish.  \n\nThe menu included an incredibile list of \"Specialty Dishes\" that may appeal more to oriental persons than others.  There were at least 50 items, including duck tongue, spicy tripe, bbq chicken kidneys, king snake, braised fish head, spicy sea snails, and many less exotic dishes.  Prices for most dishes were between $8 and $15, but there were some in the $20-30 range, including whole chicken and whole fish.  The restaurant had three fish tanks that had live lobsters, rock fish, and shrimp (all quite large).  \n\nTwo flat-screen TVs on opposite walls of the dining room played a Chinese move (Channel CCTV4) with Chinese subtitles, with the sound turned off.. The noise level was a bit high, both from activities in the kitchen (which was partially open to the dining room), and from guests talking in the dining room.  But overall a pleasant experience.
