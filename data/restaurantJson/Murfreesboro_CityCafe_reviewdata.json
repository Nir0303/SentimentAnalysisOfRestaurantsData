He ordered breakfast and I ordered lunch. I get a meat and two. We are sitting there eating and talking when I look back toward the kitchen - out comes a burger with 2 legs! It slowly walks by the table and I think it winked at me! No wait, that was the waitress hiding behind it...\n\nEver been to the beach and watch guys when a girl walks by. In unison all their heads turn and follow her until she reaches her beach towel and her tattooed and muscled boyfriend. At which point they start looking at the sky, the ocean, the sand, seagulls....this burger was the food equivalent to a girl in a bikini walking on the beach. Diners were mostly men and all heads turned and following that plate to it's destination. It was about 8\" tall with 2 patties, double cheese, a pile of leaf lettuce - not that stringy shredded stuff and THICK tomatoes, not those anger inducing paper thin slices that you pay 50 cents extra for at some fast food places. I didn't see anything speared down the middle to keep it from tipping over, so the waitress must have worked as a juggler at her former job.  \n\nWait - back to what I ordered - too busy thinking about the future. Country steak with white gravy, green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy. Beans were awesome as were the mashed potatoes. Country fried steak - it was OK. One issue - it had white gravy and the potatoes had brown - wasn't expected that so I didn't know to specify. Had to ask for cornbread - fried cornbread. It was good - not great. Friend got breakfast with country ham, eggs, shredded hashbrowns, 2 eggs, biscuit and gravy. Decent size piece of ham. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Think the potatoes were institutional. He didn't eat them, but I think he just didn't want them.\n\nWill I be back? Ummm...yeah! I have a double cheeseburger with my name on it! That's just a saying, in case you were wondering...you can't write on meat...", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-27T07:41:13-0400", "location_id": "1068757", "id": "397967043", "user": {"username": "room121", "user_location": {"name": "Smyrna, Tennessee", "id": "55343"}}}]}
