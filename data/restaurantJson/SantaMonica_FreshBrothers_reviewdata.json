If I hadn't seen an employee wearing his Fresh Brothers shirt in the alley, I never would have found the place. \n\nThat employee, and the guy at the counter were great. The guy in the alley walked beside my car to show me the well hidden entrance to the underground parking and then waited by the elevator in the lobby for me to show me where the restaurant was.\n\nCounter guy was also extremely helpful. I wanted a GF pizza to both eat there and take the rest with me, and a salad to take. No problem, got my excellent and hot pizza brought to the table, then picked up my chilled salad at the counter when I was ready to leave.\n\nThe gluten-free pizza crust is the second best I've ever had in more than a dozen years of being on a (medical) gluten-free diet.
