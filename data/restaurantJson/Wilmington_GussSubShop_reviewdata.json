It was right across the street from the Doubletree.  The front room consisted of tables and chairs and the back of the shop contained a meat counter and small grocery store.  Breakfast sandwiches were made to order - egg, ham, sausage, bacon, cheese on your choice of bread.  Fresh fruit was also available.  Prices were very reasonable - $3 or $4 for a sandwich.  The place was very clean and the staff was friendly.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2013-04-18T12:18:56-0400", "location_id": "420860", "id": "158141132", "user": {"username": "Candy995", "user_location": {"name": "Cincinnati", "id": null}}}]}
