Had lunch there today for the first time while I was on jury duty in the courthouse across the street. Casual place for downtown employees. Short cafeteria style line with sandwiches, one hot entree and variety of salads. The woman with me ordered the beef stroganoff which came with a hot breadstick and soda for $8. I had a sandwich with piled high Boar's Head deli ham, thin sliced apples and Brie cheese on a fresh bun. I added one of the fruit salads. My bill was under $8. In addition to Caesar salads and a house tossed salad, they had about six salads of the type only seen at a potluck--3 bean salad, fruit salad, a tomato-cucumber-onion salad, cole \nslaw, etc. They also have 5 or 6 special hamburgers. Think I'll try them again tomorrow!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-10-14T12:32:42-0400", "location_id": "4653996", "id": "234387165", "user": {"username": "MarthaIllinois", "user_location": {"name": "Peoria, IL", "id": null}}}]}
