There is more to see than you would think. Park at one end and take a leisurely stroll down the street. Peek into some of the quaint shops. Stop for lunch and have some really delicious and authentic Mexican food. Bring a treat home from the bakery. Check out a good book at the library.  Lots of local flavor here. Watch for special events put on during the year.
