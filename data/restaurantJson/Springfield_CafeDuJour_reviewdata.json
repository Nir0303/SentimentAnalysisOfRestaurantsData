Same with the lattes.  They're powerful and rich.\n\nThe service is very good considering the traffic they see, and very tailored to your personal needs.  They'll remember you most likely, and go out of their way to please.\n\nI'm a huge fan of real hummus, and this place has it.  You can get it in a wrap with fresh veggies, or with pita.  Made like it's made in the place they invented it; slightly spicy, lemony, with real tahini.\n\nMy husband's a fan of American food and goes for cheese and veggies on a wrap - he can get just the veggies he wants, always fresh and tasty.\n\nLots of great baked goods, from pound cakes and muffins to baklava fill the shelves, but they're popular, so if you go late, you might miss out. \n\nThis is a popular place with regulars, but out-of-towners will find it a refreshing change from chain food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-08-18T13:25:06-0400", "location_id": "856848", "id": "222741378", "user": {"username": "Lindsay H", "user_location": {"name": "Hartford, Connecticut", "id": "33804"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Just what I was lookin' for!
