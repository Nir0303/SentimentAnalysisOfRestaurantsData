This one has good food at a very fair price. All complete dinners under $15. I had the hamburger steak dinner. The salad was good sized with  fresh green lettuce (unusual these days, especially when the price is moderate)  The hamburger was a generous size with sides of potatoes and vegetables.  The O'Brian potatoes were very good.  The meat was moist but not very tasty, as were the vegetables.\nWith ketchup, not too bad.  The staff was very nice, and several \"regulars\" came by that Sunday evening.  Very homey.   \nIn a more \"upscale\" area, I probably would not have taken the time to review, but in this area all of good restaurants I know are either Mexican or Asian food.  Their used to be a number of really good coffee shops in the area.  It was nice to see that there is one place you can still get a decent coffee shop meal at a fair price.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-01-28T09:07:00-0500", "location_id": "3297962", "id": "251482339", "user": {"username": "Brenda G", "user_location": {"name": "Monterey Park, California", "id": "32738"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-12", "title": "Great coffee shop", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32338-d3297962-r148945825-m11068-Goody_s-El_Monte_California.html#review148945825", "text": "I've been going to the old one for along Imelda on Las Tunas.
