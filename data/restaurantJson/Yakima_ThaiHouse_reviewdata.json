Featuring beef, chicken, and prawns with red and green peppers, bamboo and carrots, in a sauce, it was a big enough serving for two. It isn't served with rice, so added a side of sticky rice to help soak up the delicious sauce. I asked for medium spicy and it was just right. When I finished, my lips were pleasantly burning! The only detractor from the meal is that the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license and I really could've used a beer to offset the spicy heat! Service was a smidge uneven, but it was not a deal breaker. Convenient location to convention center. Appropriate destination for singles, couples, families and it looked as it there may have been enough space in the back for large parties. I was here for dinner but they also have a lunch buffet.
