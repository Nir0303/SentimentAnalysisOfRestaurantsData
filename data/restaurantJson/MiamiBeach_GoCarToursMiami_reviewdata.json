We where very excited as we got to Miami to take the tour.. We want to switch to another day . So I tried to call them in there business hours 10-7 . I tried the whole morning but nobody picked up the phone or react to me emails. So I decide to go there to reschedule my appointment . The guy was friendly and said no problem at all. We can come tomorrow at the same time... All excited we got there next day...but then the disappointment began. The owner was not there... There was a guy who rent the scooters. He had no idea . He called the owner who was in Fort Lauderdale . Finally they organized the go car. As it arrived the disappointment got bigger... It looked like an old bumper car... The guy tried to install the GPS but it was not working . Also with several calls to the owner they didn't got it to run. So we decide we want to have the refund... The only thing what was working was that they took directly the security deposit of 300 dollar from my account.. Now 4 days later its still the hold on my credit card... And to get the 99.- dollar fee back he said I have to call San Francisco. As I said that he please has to organize this and not me in my vacation time sitting on the phone.. He said we will get a refund... Up for today I see nothing on my account... \nSo i would never recommend the GPS tour.. Old cars very bad customer service... \nWe went to the tourist information. The guy said the owner bought the cars already old and there is always trouble with it... \nSo we did a speed boot tour instead what was a lot of fun...", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2012-10-18T03:04:45-0400", "location_id": "877868", "id": "143102323", "user": {"username": "Built4fun", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "This is so much fun!

What a great way to experience South Beach in just one hour. The car operated flawlessly for us including the GPS system. The car even called me \"speedy\" when I went a little too fast down Ocean Blvd! Haha, we got a good chuckle out of that. Jesus from GoCar Tours made the whole experience a breeze. We would do this again wherever it is offered. 5 stars!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2011-08-28T09:15:10-0400", "location_id": "877868", "id": "117361046", "user": {"username": "Scott W", "user_location": {"name": "Toronto, Canada", "id": "155019"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2011-08", "title": "interesting little car!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34439-d877868-r116536584-m11068-GoCar_Tours_Miami-Miami_Beach_Florida.html#review116536584", "text": "we were a group of 4 and we purhcased 2 groupons for a gocar tour for 1 hour. not really sure if it was a deal becuase we still had to pay for taxes and insurance so that brought our total to close to the orig price... $50.\n\nit is kind of hard communicating with the tour folks because the phone is rarely picked up so it was very hard to get a hold of them. their office is also kind of hard to find. its not on a main road. anyway, the things are operated like a scooter, not an actual car. the 1 hour tour doesnt go that far and passes by very quick.\n\ntheir facility is a booth in a shop, don't count on food/bathrooms/lockers for use. they have some soda/water for sale only.\n\nPROS:\n-good way to see south beach if you're lazy to walk! it introduces you to lots in the area\n-definitely a head turner! people will definitely wave and gawk!\n-probably a comfortable experience if its not 100+degrees in humidity in south beach!\n-no hidden charges/fees\n-easy to get setup /going on the tour\n\nCONS:\n-not built for 2 large framed people because you'll be elbowing each other especially in the heat  and humidity of south beach!\n-the turns can be short of warning on the gps so don't drive too fast!\n-its an open car so expect gas smell your whole ride. its also quite bumpy (the car vibrates the whole time while you drive it)\n-its a very small car and during times with lots of traffic it can feel intimidating\n-theres really no safety harnesses so pray that your friend or you do not get into an accident\n-hard to get ahold of the tour people on the phone. best to walk in and make a reservation.\n-hard for the driver to really focus on what the gps is saying because theyre focused on driving the route properly\n\nwith all that said, i would recommend it and i would consider doing it again for the 3 hour tour in nice windy weather.. otherwise do the 1 hour tour in the heat because thats pushing it already... but hopefully south beach's weather won't melt me the next time because boy was i breaking a sweat!! the guys who work at the shop actually follow you along your route to make sure you are on schedule/not lost so that was neat. if you are not familiar with the area it can be hard to get back on track because the map they provide is not very clear.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2011-08-10T12:32:49-0400", "location_id": "877868", "id": "116536584", "user": {"username": "sasli", "user_location": {"name": "new york", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2011-08", "title": "Fun way to see South Beach", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34439-d877868-r116516437-m11068-GoCar_Tours_Miami-Miami_Beach_Florida.html#review116516437", "text": "It was a great way to tour South Beach in a fun two seated motorized car.
