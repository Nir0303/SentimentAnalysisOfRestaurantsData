It is family-owned, I found the proprietors friendly and helpful, and I got a great price for 5 days through booking.com. The refrigerator in the room was a real plus since it helped me store food and save on meals. There is fresh coffee and a sweet roll in the office. I was able to swap my 2-bed room upstairs for a one-bed room downstairs. The bed was comfortable, the linens were clean. There were no bugs or cobwebs in the window sills or curtains. \nThe only downside is the traffic noise. Railroad Avenue is extremely busy, even at night, and you will hear every bus, truck, car and motorcycle that goes by. And the railroad is across the street. It was the most noise I have ever heard at a motel.
