There are about 12 tables/booths.  The atmosphere is plain, but pleasant.  Diners can look out onto busy Providence Rd. if they wish, or just enjoy the quiet of the cafe.\n\nI had a chicken plate; he had the kofta plate.  Both were just right. The chef had taken great care to arrange the meal so that it was a pleasure to see it and anticipate the taste. There was a small amount of hot pepper sauce that could be mixed in to taste--it really added to the dishes.  The pita bread is the best we've had in Columbia.\nWe had enough food that we took about half home and added an order of baba ganoush to go with it for the next day's lunch.\n\nThe only downside was the less-than-enthusiastic waitress.  When ordering, I asked what herbs/spices are in the hummus chicken shawarma plate because I'm allergic to basil.  She didn't know and wasn't interested in finding out what was in it.  She couldn't bring me a sample to sniff because it is already in the dish.  She wasn't busy, just not \"into being a waitress\" by behavior.\n\nThe food, however, was so very good, that we will be back.
