To start off my wife is a quadriplegic and we have a chocolate lab service dog to assist her with doors and picking up items. As we entered the restaurant the manager told us they do not allow dogs inside the building. She was wearing her service vest, but I still informed him that she is a service dog for my wife. The manager again told us she was still not allowed inside the restaurant. He then asked what my wife's disability was and why we needed to have the dog inside the restaurant with us. My wife told him its non of his business and she was not required to tell him. We did inform him it is against federal regulations to ask what her disability was and why the dog needed to be there. After informing him of that he did appologize and allowed us in, at which point we then felt uncomfortable dining in there.
