WHY did I wait so long???\n\nMy son and I decided on Arby's only because the Indian restaurant nearby was due to close in 15 minutes and wouldn't serve us anything but take out (oh well, we'll try them next time).  \n\nThe place was virtually empty, making it that much more appealing, so ordering was a breeze, but a little pokey.  Although I'm learning that Utah might be on \"aloha speed\" as well as Honolulu (where I live), because everything seems to move vvveeeerrrrryyyy ssssllllooooowww here (except the interstate speed - DAMN - 70 MPH through the city....... LOVE IT!!!)\n\nThe staff were pleasant.\n\nThe joint was clean.\n\nPrices were very reasonable (love the value menu).\n\nThe food was decent, a little dry, but the Arby's sauce and the Horsey sauce made it manageable.\n\nI do want to try their ruben sandwich, but that can wait till next time, and there WILL be a next time - sooner rather than later.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-16T06:36:34-0400", "location_id": "4797198", "id": "299856351", "user": {"username": "Tamodio", "user_location": {"name": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "id": "60982"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Just okay", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57122-d4797198-r286916810-m11068-Arby_s-Sandy_Utah.html#review286916810", "text": "We tried their special chicken salad sandwich.
