The breakfasts were delicious, and the conversation and welcome arms were absolutely what we needed!\n\nThe building itself is a work of art and architecture, built circa 1913 and on the National Registry of Historic Buildings.  Walking into the front entry room you are greeted with a home that most haven't seen outside of the 1930s southern plantations.\n\nThe B&B is located about 6 miles from Texas A&M, which means even on super busy game weekends there is little traffic, yet it is a quick drive to get to campus.  The rooms are quiet, but when you walk occasionally the floor creaks in the way that only a 100 year old home, on all its glory and nostalgia, can.\n\nIf you're an early riser, and lucky enough, you can play \"guess what's for breakfast\" while the delicious aromas waft upwards from the kitchen on the ground floor.\n\nThis B&B has been a \"well kept secret\" by many, and some guests have been making regular stays for over a decade.  A commitment like that should tell you how marvelous the stay is!\n\nOn a personal note: while we were visiting, our daughter was locked out of her apartment.  While waiting for the roommate to get off work, Ed and Sue welcomed her into their home as well, and made what could have been a long afternoon sitting outside a pleasant stay indoors.

My husband and I stayed at the Victory Rose May 9-11, 2014 to attend our daughter's graduation form A & M. The house is perfectly decorated and the wicker rocking chairs on the huge from porch just beg to be rockrd\nin. Everything was available from luscious bath robes to coffee in your room. The breakfasts\nwere absolutely delicious and Ed and Sue, the owners, invited our graduating daughter to join\nus both days free even of any charge. We definitely plan a return visit even though our daughter\nwon't be there. The room with the fireplace calls for a winter time visit. Do yourself a favor and  check out their web site victoryrosebandb,com. Ed and Sue DON'T raise their rates during special A&M functions like the other hotels do.
