We were dressed in typical Harley touring gear. Black leather, boots, etc. We were greeted warmly, and seated quickly, despite being what we would have considered being severely under dressed for the establishment. Bravo for that!!\n\nOur server was friendly, fun, and patient as we thoroughly surveyed the great wine options. Her demeanor just continued the positive experience for us throughout our visit.\n\nMy wife ordered the filet, to be cooked a perfect medium rare. She asked for the Bearnaise and Cabernet reduction sauces on the side. She was then told about their secret sauce, which is a delicious combination of the two. So, she brought all three for my wife to experience. \n\nI ordered one of their specials - two filet medallions, med-rare, with scallops and a Roma tomato Hollandaise sauce over their garlic mashed potatoes. I asked if they would mind substituting out the potatoes for something else. It was no issue at all.\n\nEverything was cooked to absolute perfection! The red wine was presented at the proper temperature (which is NOT room temp); a rarity these days.\n\nAfter dinner, we enjoyed their flourless dark chocolate torte, with cordials. We would have preferred A nice LBV or Tawny Port, but they were temporarily out. Unfortunate, but it happens. The one Ruby Port they had was up on the shelf... empty. \n\nWe would most definitely recommend giving them a try if you're in the area. I know we will!!\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-16T14:35:50-0400", "location_id": "7075245", "id": "428547968", "user": {"username": "Steve Y", "user_location": {"name": "Pasadena, Maryland, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Great Steaks", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60845-d7075245-r428021780-m11068-B_Christopher_s-Greensboro_North_Carolina.html#review428021780", "text": "Love, love love this restaurant.

None of the premium's I like were available.\nOrdered raw oysters, and they were served at room temperature, not on ice. Both the mignonette and the cocktail sauce were poor. Mignonette was devoid of shallots and the cocktail sauce was too thick. \nThe steak was ok, but they did not have creamed spinach as a side. First steak house I have ever been in that did not.  \nOnly reason this is not one star is the bartender, who explained his boss would not give him the budget for better liquors", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-10-02T10:32:09-0400", "location_id": "7075245", "id": "315641462", "user": {"username": "steve m", "user_location": {"name": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "id": "60845"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Awesome meat and great bartender", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60845-d7075245-r313784095-m11068-B_Christopher_s-Greensboro_North_Carolina.html#review313784095", "text": "I went to you place late on a Friday night around 930 as they were closing at 10 PM which I thought was a little early given it's a weekend but anyway there was not a lot of people left in the restaurant only may be about 15 but the crowd was nice I ate at the bar I had filet mignon and brussels sprouts that were over-the-top good.
