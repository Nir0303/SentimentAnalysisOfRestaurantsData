For the craft beer aficionados, there were a decent number of good choices, including Ninkasi, Stone, Deschutes, Lagunitas. There are special hours of the day for half-price drinks - look on their website for the details, it's kind of a game to get there at the right time.\n\nYou have to stand in line at the bar to get your drinks. If you want peanuts, you have to ask for them. Yes, there are shells all over the floor. Yes, the place overall is fairly grubby, but the table we sat down at had been wiped and was clean enough for our elbows. The ladies restroom was clean enough to use. I am not that picky, honestly - I believe our immune systems are developed by exposure to dirt and germs, and this would be a fine place to develop your immune system, drink good cheap beers, and blast the cobwebs out of your head with loud music.

My last birthday was spent enjoying it at this wonderful place where refined beer flows from great bartenders that are happy handing you your next delicious adventure of beer. It is a place without snootiness or image building. Its about beer, conversation, sports and having a good time. Outsiders are easy to spot and mostly people are in good moods unless their team lost. \n\nFor those that wrote not liking that the place doesnt have food, it doesnt say \"Goat Hill Tavern and Food.\" Tavern implies beer, if you want food order it to be delivered. They let you do that. The bouncers are pretty much in the top standings of the nice security guards, no douchery. Two things about this place that make it my favorite place, it helped provide the location of the beginning of my learning about beer because they have so many great beers available and I am a changed woman! There is nothing better than a good beer, so much more complicated than people treat it. Second, its a regular spot for myself and the boyfriend that tue bartenders know us. \n\nIts great, just go and stop looking at this website trying to decide.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-09-30T19:24:56-0400", "location_id": "780265", "id": "118801190", "user": {"username": "graciecamacho", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2011-09", "title": "Great place for good Beer ... despite being a little dirty/smelly", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32253-d780265-r118629398-m11068-Goat_Hill_Tavern-Costa_Mesa_California.html#review118629398", "text": "I finally made it to The Goat Hill Tavern and it is much like I had anticipated from the reviews.
