My salad was made with crisp lettuce, shredded carrots, mandarin oranges and yummy shaded chicken with the dressing on the side.  It also came with a yummy muffin.  We were offered drink refills and my daughter and grandson received their drink refills in to go cups.  We all left with full tummys and smiles.  Very fun, inviting restaurant with delicious food choices.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-08T23:38:17-0400", "location_id": "4371571", "id": "287083556", "user": {"username": "meme4749", "user_location": {"name": "Yorba Linda, California", "id": "33298"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Check the wine prices!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33298-d4371571-r286958326-m11068-Mimi_s_Cafe-Yorba_Linda_California.html#review286958326", "text": "Today I treated three friends to lunch at Mimi's. Each of us ordered a glass of wine. The sign in front said , \"Enjoy a glass of wine for five dollars.\"When  we received our bill we were charged eight dollars per glass. The server said they changed  their policy about one month ago about all wine being  five dollars. Seems to me they should inform you about that before you order. She apologized and said she had received numerous complaints.\n\nI called Jason, the manager. He apologized and said he would check it out.\nWhen I spoke to his supervisor, Mike, he said he was unfamiliar with the sign and would check it out. I doubt very much that this will happen.\n\nI'm disappointed that Mimi's seems to be deliberately misleading their customers.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-08T14:28:12-0400", "location_id": "4371571", "id": "286958326", "user": {"username": "Lynda D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
