It is a huge storefront but not a bakery with a huge selection...not a typical bakery. But the cupcakes and other selections are wonderful.  Try them all!

They had about 20 different kinds of homemade cupcakes and everything was decorated so nicely . The lady behind the counter was very nice and attentive. I love little shops that pay attention to detail. It is a shame that there are not more of these places. Chains are taking over and ruining the restaurant experience. Food and service was great.

The frosting doesn't leave that residue or aftertaste that others I have tried did.  Also, they are super moist and you can tell baked from scratch.  I never tried the cake pops so I can't say how those are.  Only bummer is this place was closed on Mondays and Tuesday, last time I there anyhow, perhaps its changed.  Its across from the small and only mall in town. Oh, my daughter went to a cupcake decorating party their and loved it.  I think they would do well selling items like a boutique does as they have the room.
