The outside doesn't look like much and the name doesn't ring of authenticity in Caribbean Cuisine.  My mother always said never judge a book by its cover.  That applies here.  \n\nThe Pernil was fall off the bone tender and some of the tastiest pork I have ever tried.  The Cerdo Guisada was rich and flavorful.  The is Dominican home cooking at its best.  I also had tostones, red beans and rice and beef empanadas.  All were what you would expect.  All this with a soft drink set me back $18.\nThe service was friendly and efficient and the restaurant was very clean.  The portions were enough for both me and my wife and we even had leftovers.\n\nMy first opinion was certainly wrong.  Take the time to check out this place with its daily changing menu and enjoy.  You won't be disappointed.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-25T09:24:43-0400", "location_id": "5423456", "id": "282922563", "user": {"username": "Kurk H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
