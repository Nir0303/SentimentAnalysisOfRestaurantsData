I was in town on business so I wanted a lot of space to prepare for a civil case two days later. They didn't have any rooms avail that Wednesday so I had to say at another hotel for that day but I was expected to check back into the Radisson after my case that Thursday Oct 24th. Upon attempting to check in, the receptionist told me that my room was ready and gave me a key. I didn't question the room type because I booked the Executive Suite. I was surprised when I entered the room and it was a tiny room with a queen bed. I immediately went downstairs and asked for the room i reserved. I was told that in order to get the Executive Suite they would have to bump someone down to my room  in order to accommodate me. \nBasically he told me that I was bumped down to accommodate another guest even though I had a reserved and paid for my room. I told him I refuse to be treated like that and I was checking out and going to another hotel.\nThe gentleman told me to let him know where i wanted to go, and he would have the shuttle bus take me. On my way to the Marriott the driver pulled over and said \"this is not the Marriott but I have to drop you off here.\" I was stunned. He literally pulled all of my luggage and placed it in the middle of the parking and drove off. I couldn't believe that happened. \nI made my way to the hotel lobby and asked for directions. They offered to keep my luggage while I walk three long ND blocks to the Marriott. After arriving at the Marriott and checked in, the awesome receptionist Samantha went and picked up my luggage. \nThat evening my card declined and after speaking with my bank I found out that The Radisson charged me for the room. When i called the Radisson , the manager told me that they had no idea i checked out. As a matter of fact, he thought I was in the hotel.
