The place was extremely busy and I had to wait for 10 minutes just to put in my order. I almost walked outside to call and order as I surely would have gotten my order in faster had I done so. I ordered hot and sour soup, General Tso chicken that came with rice and an eggroll, and an order of crab rangoon. The soup wasn't too bad and I would give it a 2.5/5. The crab rangoon was ok, not bad but I've certainly had better and I would give it a 2.5/5. The General Tso chicken was meh. The sauce didn't have much flavor to it and the chicken breading was rather soft and lacking any real texture to it and I would give it a 2/5. The egg roll was simply awful and I threw it away after one bite, 0/5. Based on the other high-rated reviews, I was really let down.
