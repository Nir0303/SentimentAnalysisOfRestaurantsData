I was pleased with the amount of beef that adorned the top of the stir fry as, unfortunately, veggies tend to leave me feeling hungry after eating. Not so with ample beef (which is a reasonable additional cost for the quantity). The combination of flavors was quite tasty for me. This stir fry is pretty much as good as it gets. In other words, I am not sure I have ever had better in a restaurant. In terms of overall rating, I cannot give Kara Lynn's more than a four for two reasons: 1) we had to go to the counter to order and pay on the spot. I prefer wait staff coming over and taking my order and paying after I have eaten; and 2) we had to get up and get water for ourselves. For some, this may seem nit-picky, but, hey, these are my preferences and I did not know, going in, that those were the house rules. I will say that there was a steady stream of people coming for take-out, another testament for the quality of the food. Will I return?

If you need to follow a gluten free meal plan or are on the Paleo diet then this is an added benefit. Kara Lynn's is a great place to go before a show at the Capitol Theatre.  Try their famous Carrot Muffins and their Chocolate Pudding made with avocados - both of these are amazing! And the service is great as well. p.s. - I understand you can also have them cook meals for you weekly.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-02-28T00:53:17-0500", "location_id": "7604560", "id": "256870436", "user": {"username": "AJFF33756", "user_location": {"name": "Clearwater, Florida", "id": "34141"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Gluten free & paleo dining", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d7604560-r249212130-m11068-Kara_Lynn_s-Clearwater_Florida.html#review249212130", "text": "We have walked by many times and finally walked in.
