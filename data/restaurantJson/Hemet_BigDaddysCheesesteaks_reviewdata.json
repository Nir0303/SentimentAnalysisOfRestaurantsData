The Chicken marinara was really good. My favorite sandwich is the \"Big Daddy sub..it is amazing! It's $9.95 and is huge, 3x the meat as fresh cut subs. Great mix of meats and cheeses. Takes a littlt time to get your order done, but that's because they make everything fresh.......except the mac n cheese apparently buy some of the other reviews I read. Fries are good as well.\nDefinitely recommend this place if you want a great sandwich that will fill you up and satisfy your taste buds.(Remember to add the pepper relish and other spices to taste.\nI always add mayo and mustered to the Big Daddy sub with the relish....amazing!\n\nGreat staff, friendly and they really try hard for their customers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-15T15:44:30-0400", "location_id": "6674493", "id": "319165344", "user": {"username": "Muykido", "user_location": {"name": "Palm Springs, California", "id": "32847"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Best Hot Subs in town!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32486-d6674493-r281934543-m11068-Big_Daddy_s_Cheesesteaks-Hemet_California.html#review281934543", "text": "They offer the best Philly Cheese, great portions, super fresh,  and delish.
