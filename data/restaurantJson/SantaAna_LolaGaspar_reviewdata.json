Also shared the short rib tacos with my wide, spicy but very good. \nAll their drinks are also very good. I first had the LA Bomba which on the sweet side. Also, had the Mas Fuerte, which is exactly that; a stronger drink. Desserts are very good...save room for desert.\nLastly, do not forget about the kids. They enjoyed the restaurant too. I don't think they have a kids menu but they do offer kid size portions.

I liked the spicy one which was hot and sweet.  We decided to do some sharing, so we ordered the crispy chicken chile rellano and the crispy rolled carnitas tacos.  OH MY GOSH!  They were both amazing!  The rolled tacos are basically a carnitas taquito and are topped with a crema, a sauce drizzle, cotija, and cilantro.  The meat is very flavorful.  My mouth is watering remembering it.  I really enjoyed these.  Next came the rellano and it was even more flavor on a plate.  I cut it in half since we were sharing.  It was a decent size and the chile is covered in a crispy breading then topped with escovitch vegetables in a tangy sauce and cilantro.  IT was seriously outstanding.  I suspect that they change the menu up pretty regularly from other reviews and photos of the menus that I've seen, which I love.\n\nAfter those tasty treats, we topped it off with their butterscotch pot de creme with whipped creme and that makes me go \"mmmmm\".   WOW.  SOoooo tasty, sweet butterscotch with a bit of salt.  Perfect ending.\n\nI was driving so didn't have a drink.  The husband had an IPA draft... it seems that their beer list rotates.  The cocktail menu had me very interested, so I'm hoping next time I can try a Huckleberry.  Instead I had iced tea which my server did a good job of keeping filled.\n\nService was good and all staff were very friendly.  Total cost was right about $50 without tip\n\nYou probably wonder why only 4 stars.  We had two issues, one was we were asked three times by different people if we wanted more chips and each time we said yes, but it took until we asked a fourth time that we actually got the chips and that was after the dessert.  Also, I understand the way they deliver the food as it becomes ready, but I'm not a huge fan of that system.  I like my food to come in an orderly manner... this will not keep me from eating here, though, because I fell in love a little bit with this restaurant.  Last problem was the single bathroom was not working and kind of a mess as well.   Had to head out to find another place to use the restroom.\n\nOverall, this place is awesome.  I highly recommend you give it a try if in the area.  We were coming from the Anaheim Convention Center... it was about 5 miles from there and took about 10 minutes to get there.  There is a parking structure a block away, for easy parking if you don't find street parking nearby. Note that it is quite small and while they have both indoor and outdoor seating, I don't think you could fit a party any larger than about 5 people. \n\nThey also have an Art Walk right on 2nd so it was very festive with booths and musicians playing along 2nd right outside the restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-20T11:44:53-0400", "location_id": "1466524", "id": "266877489", "user": {"username": "ladyjadegd", "user_location": {"name": "Escondido, California", "id": "32358"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "They have it ALL right!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33043-d1466524-r257117194-m11068-Lola_Gaspar-Santa_Ana_California.html#review257117194", "text": "In Town on business and over the weekend had time to visit Santa Ana.
