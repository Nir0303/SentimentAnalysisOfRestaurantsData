When I first started coming here I was overwhelmed with the kindness the generosity the friendliness and the quality of the food for the price. But over the last year I have noticed a significant change. Not in the waitresses or the service but in the quality of the food and the prices... It started out you got a really nice breakfast $1.99... you didn't go away hungry... But I'll admit you were over filled either... Now $3.99 you're lucky if you get a good smell of the food.. The cooks in the back is pretty much taken control of the restaurant... They cook the food the way they want it... I like my toast cook on the grill because it doesn't get dried out so bad. Now they refuse to do that because they claim that it takes way too long. If you order your eggs medium, they come back burned around the edges and on the bottom... If you complain that's just all it is complain... They continue to do things the way they want to do.... The only thing that keeps me coming back here is the ladies that work here, they are the best waitresses I've ever seen, one in particular.... Her name is Rhonda... She meet you at the door or at your table and makes you feel like your family and she hasn't seen you in forever... Always has a smile on her face... This lady is the queen of waitresses in my opinion.... Stop by give it a try and ask for her, Rhonda.... I hope this benefits you, and deciding a place to have a good breakfast...", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-13T05:13:57-0400", "location_id": "4628881", "id": "382144321", "user": {"username": "Bob C", "user_location": {"name": "Westland", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "The food is home cooked and really good.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42811-d4628881-r376693520-m11068-Westland_Family_Diner-Westland_Michigan.html#review376693520", "text": "I eat here as often as I can, when I'm looking for a home cooked meal.
