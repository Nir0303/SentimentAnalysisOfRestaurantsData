We visited and and we're glad we did. Despite a no frills appearance and limited service, the food is delicious. There was a steady stream of locals that came in while we were there that seemed to confirm our assessment of the food. We dabbled in the Chinese food and also ordered some fish and oysters. \n\nFYI, pretty much everything on the menu is fried. I suppose you could order another method of preparation, but I didn't see anyone else do it. Also, your choice of sides for platters consists of fries, hush puppies, and ham fried rice... Yeah, it's your cheat day, embrace the fried stuff. Vegetables? There was rumor of some cole slaw available, but why would you get slaw when you could have hush puppies?\n\nThe place isn't much to look parking is sparse, and service is limited to ordering and picking up at the counter. However, the food is edible comfort. I give this place a strong recommendation.

To get there, you have to drive through a less than desirable neighborhood unfortunately. There is limited parking, and the interior to the market/restaurant is pretty awful. That said, the fresh fish selection is fantastic. You can choose a fish, have them prepare it, and then cook it anyway you want. We opted for just ordering off the menu. I had 2 pcs of whiting and 12 fried shrimp. My husband had the seafood platter that included 2 pcs of tilapia, shrimp, scallops and oysters. We both loved our fish, fried in the lightest batter. You can get either hush puppies, french fries, or ham fried rice. This place also serves several Chinese dishes; I heard that the owner runs a Chinese restaurant just down the street. My advice would be to go, order your food, then take it home and enjoy it in your home surroundings; the interior is really pretty awful and because the fish prices are very reasonable, attracted a wide variety of customers.
