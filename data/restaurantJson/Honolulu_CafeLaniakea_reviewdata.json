We were visiting the Iolani Palace and this is just across the road.  Firstly the setting is fabulous, like a colonial building.  The restaurant only opened at the beginning of this month and serves breakfast and lunch.  The staff were so friendly, telling us about the menu and locally sourced food which we thought was excellent and very reasonably priced.  We really enjoyed the visit so make a note of the address if you are visiting the area on your holiday.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-05-26T19:36:23-0400", "location_id": "433955", "id": "130656028", "user": {"username": "Penny6123", "user_location": {"name": "York, United Kingdom", "id": "186346"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Nice cafe, tricky to find.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d433955-r97132410-m11068-Cafe_Laniakea-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html#review97132410", "text": "Took my family here the last day we were in Oahu.

The food is wonderful fresh local cuisine. I had a crabcake salad.  It was really yummy, crabcake over greens with this delicious dressing. They also have plantation iced tea and nice BIG fresh desserts.  The dining room was in the back of the building so you cannot easily see it from the street.  I believe the facility might be members only but the allow anyone in for lunch you just have to sign in.  The building is unbelievable designed by Julia Morgran built around 1920.  Dining room is open air faces a courtyard and really very elegant.  This is an out of the way find and I would highly recommend the food which is incredible and a chance to  look at a beautifully designed old building.  Service was great and prices range from $7-$14.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2010-07-13T11:40:03-0400", "location_id": "433955", "id": "70799119", "user": {"username": "Mary3885", "user_location": {"name": "Jacksonville, Florida", "id": "60805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great food in the Downtown Honolulu area!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d433955-r70566110-m11068-Cafe_Laniakea-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html#review70566110", "text": "Food and service was spectacular!
