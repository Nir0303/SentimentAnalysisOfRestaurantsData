Wow, is this a five-star hotel?  No, of course not.  But we had a fantastic experience, so I'm rating my experience as 5 starts.\n\nWe arrived on a busy Friday night, and were met by the valet who explained our parking options.  We chose to self-park, and he suggested we leave our car out front while we unloaded, checked in, and took our bags to our room.  No pressure to use the valet or bell hop services.  That's great customer service right off the bat.  We didn't abuse this, and returned 15 minutes later to park our car.\n\nWe checked in with the mobile app, and I requested a high room, and in the comments, a quiet room.  We were treated to a top floor, mid-hallway room which afforded an amazing view of the beautiful town and countryside.  We were far from the elevators and didn't hear any unreasonable noise.\n\nThe room was CLEAN.  While Marriott seems to like dated-looking carpet and wallpaper, the linens, pillows, and towels seemed brand new.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless.  Intermediate housekeeping was good, too.  \n\nThe water pressure during the morning shower rush wasn't great, but we accepted the fact that we were in the top floor and shouldn't expect great pressure.  I also showered in the afternoon and the pressure was much better.  The hot water was plentiful at all times, and actually very hot--be careful with the little ones.  There is no fan in the bathroom, so plan ahead...\n\nThe TV programming is generous, but most of it is in standard definition.  Wifi was fast and reliable.\n\nThe bar area is nice for mingling, and there was free coffee in the morning, which was actually pretty good.  We didn't go to the executive lounge at all during our stay.\n\nThe hotel is centrally located with easy access to shopping, dining, and sightseeing.  We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night and the dining options are fantastic; so  we didn't get to take advantage of room service or the restaurant.\n\nThere are three elevators, and while they move pretty fast, they can get busy during rush periods.  Bring your patience if you are trying to get up or down during check in/out or breakfast times.\n\nLancaster is beautiful during the change of season, and the Lancaster Marriott at Penn Square was a perfect base of operations for our weekend.

We arrived by Amtrak and didn't have a car, so a convenient location within walking distance of restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. was a must.  You certainly can't beat the Marriott's location. Virtually everything downtown is walkable.  And an Uber from the train station was around $10 and to the College was $7.  We never waited more than 5 minutes for an Uber, which is great in a city the size of Lancaster. (Tip: When calling for an Uber, have them pick you up half a block south of the hotel on Queen Street at the intersection of Mifflin Street. This way the car can go straight up Queen.  If the car picks you up in front of the hotel, it will be forced to take a right hand turn out of the driveway throwing you several blocks our of your way if you are heading anywhere north or west of the hotel.)\n\nThe hotel is modern and clean with satisfactory service.  It is a very typical \"corporate\" high-rise hotel which is far superior to the more typical, touristy, two-story  places in Lancaster that service the Amish Country visitors (such as a Fairfield Inn or Comfort Inn).  Room was plenty large with an up to date bathroom.  There were several large events taking place at the hotel while we were there, but none of them impacted our stay in terms of noise or service.  \n\nOur only complaint was that the Concierge Lounge had awful hours. Closed by 10:00 a.m. on Friday, and closed all day Saturday? And whereas the hours were posted as closing at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, we went up at 9:35 for breakfast and every scrap of food and drink had been removed and the staff was wiping the place down to close it.  We were counting on having breakfast up there, but got shut out and had to look elsewhere. (A staff member did note our disappointment and offered to go to the back to get me a glass of OJ, but she was only able to eek out half a glass from the pitcher.)   If one is coming in for the weekend, why even bother having a Concierge Lounge with those hours?  Most hotels that I stay in might have short \"staffed\" hours, but they are open 24/7 (with a key) if a guest wants a bottle of water or wants to make a cup of Keurig coffee or grab  an apple..  This one is locked up tight.  Very disappointing and easy to fix.  You do realize that you are charging people more for a Concierge level room, right?  If one checks in on Friday and departs on Saturday, what exactly are they getting for their money?  Certainly no cocktails on Friday evening, and certainly nothing at all on Saturday.

You couldn't have a better location in the downtown area. \nThe only drawbacks were 1) lackluster service at breakfast on one of the two days (the other day was great), and why have waffles served at the buffet without all the fun things to put on them?  2) the hot tub was a bit...off in an otherwise beautiful pool room.\nI'm still giving it 5 stars though as I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-03T13:35:56-0400", "location_id": "1099940", "id": "424826389", "user": {"username": "tom_crab", "user_location": {"name": "Maryland", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Nice Facility/Location - Needs better service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52970-d1099940-r424785703-m11068-Lancaster_Marriott_at_Penn_Square-Lancaster_Lancaster_County_Pennsylvania.html#review424785703", "text": "Nice facility, Great. location.

This should have been explained to you by our front desk team.  \n\nThere is a nightly charge for parking in the Penn Square garage as the garage is owned and operated by the Lancaster Parking Authority. While we do allow our guests to bill this fee to their guest room as a convenience, you can also pay directly at the booth as you exit, depending on your preference.\n\nLastly, I am sorry to hear about your disappointment regarding our Fresh Bites program. Marriott has begun evolving room service and chose us to be one of the first hotels to pilot this program. They are moving away from the traditional room service model with a focus on offering fast casual options for guests looking for quick, convenient food. I can certainly understand that some of our guests may not find this change to their liking. In order to facilitate a faster delivery time, we are unable to offer substitutions or deviations from menu. Should our guests have any special requests or needs, we invite them to join us in our Penn Square Grille and Rendezvous Lounge, where we are happy to modify menu items at their request.\n\nLike any new concept, an important part of this process will be to closely monitor our guests\u2019 feedback to determine what elements they like best and which need some improvement. We continue to share our guests\u2019 comments with Marriott so that these likes and dislikes can be addressed in the future.\n\nStephen S., we are constantly evaluating our team\u2019s performance and closely reviewing our guests\u2019 feedback to identify operational areas that require some improvement.
