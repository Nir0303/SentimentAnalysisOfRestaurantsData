The chef is very welcoming and even comes to greet you. The food is very well presented and on point with the seasoning and great portions. Small location in the middle of down town kissimmee and locally owned. The business is ran by the owners and their children. The kitchen staff is very sarcastic and professional. All what we ordered came out under 30 minutes and we had a big order. I had the monfongo, con tostones, fresh fries, beefsteak encebollado and arroz con gandules. Nothing like ! there was one other restaurant with the same style but they closed down and was too crazy to get to. The restaurant has street parking everywhere and free. We will come back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-19T12:51:18-0400", "location_id": "10954254", "id": "420296400", "user": {"username": "garciarosario26", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, Florida", "id": "34515"}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Buena comida ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34352-d10954254-r428269402-m11068-El_Caldero_De_Abuela-Kissimmee_Florida.html#review428269402", "text": "La porci\u00f3n de comida fue bien generosa, y con muy buen sabor.
