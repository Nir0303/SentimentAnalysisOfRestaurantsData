I waited for a seat to open at the bar and the bartender almost seemed annoyed that he had a new patron.\nI didn't really care, because all I wanted was a drink and some food after a long day traveling and working.\nThe bar tender put a card in front of me with all the wing sauce selections available, when I asked what this was for he said \"Have you never been here?  It's 55 cent wing night, these are the sauces you can order\" and proceeded to move away.  No big deal right, and awesome that wings are on special because they are one of my favorite items to eat.\nI ordered the standard wings and some Habanero wings as well.  The sauce was great, but the wings were a little small.\nI probably will not go back to this place, due to the poor service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-22T11:31:36-0400", "location_id": "6198253", "id": "395557971", "user": {"username": "Victor0201", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Very good menu & reasonably riced", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36185-d6198253-r340553760-m11068-Chicago_Street_Pub-Joliet_Illinois.html#review340553760", "text": "The atmosphere is great, fast, friendly service & a big selection on the menu.
