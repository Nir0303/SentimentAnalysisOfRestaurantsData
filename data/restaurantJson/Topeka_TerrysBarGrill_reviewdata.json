The proprietor had donated a gift certificate to support the local Shriner's organization and I won it in the silent auction. I've known Terry casually for many years through golf activities and he is one restaurant owner that pays attention to what is going on and in, and around, his namesake. He is usually in attendance but not last Saturday evening; you wouldn't have known it because his professional waitstaff hustled the duration of our visit serving the bustling crowd.\n\nUpon entering, we found one open booth as the main dining room was almost full with patrons and a large family was occupying the west dining area. Within seconds of my wife and I sitting down, our attentive waitress (Alyson) was there to welcome us and take our drink orders. She provided excellent service from start to finish and had a 'can do' attitude.\n\nMy wife ordered the single Angus burger and a side of fries  (which are very generous) and she was very complimentary. I had a 'hankering' for a chicken fried steak so I ignored the distractions on the menu and ordered it with the fries and the steak smothered in gravy.  The worst thing I can say about our entire meal, and experience, was this entree was a little bland for my taste. Our tab, before gift certificate, with a beer, tax, and tip was less than $22! and we both left wanting for naught. I guarantee I'll be back and next time I am going to take a crack at one of the steak dinners on the menu (popular choice among the diners near our booth).\n\nThis is my first written review of Terry's but I entertain some downtown business clients here throughout the year. The menu is so extensive with sandwich / entree choices for lunch (and so reasonably priced) that it is fun to experiment with the different choices just to be different or to fit your appetite du jour.  \n\nFor visitors passing through, I recommend this if it fits your itinerary as it is within a mile of Interstate 70 on the west side of our downtown.
