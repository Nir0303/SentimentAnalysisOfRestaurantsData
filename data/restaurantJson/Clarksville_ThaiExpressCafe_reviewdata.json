It is a small, quaint restaurant decorated with antique cameras and beautiful enlarged pictures of Thailand (I am assuming it is Thailand).  I ordered the stir fried chicken with ginger and my husband ordered the green curry, with spring rolls on the side.  Very yummy!  Then I saw the curry puffs (the other option for side) and ordered one.  I am craving it today!  It really feels like you are eating in somebody's home kitchen, which is fine, not fancy but like I said the food was full of flavor, and authentic tasting.  Will be back soon (maybe even tomorrow just for a quick curry puff or two)  Only accepts Cash so just be aware of that.  Decently priced especially for lunch downtown, and they use good quality ingredients.  Highly Recommend!  Visit their facebook page for their menu.  The lunch special was $7.99 for steamed rice, spring roll or curry puff (both really good!) drink, and something off the menu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-19T14:40:11-0400", "location_id": "7250421", "id": "223031719", "user": {"username": "FLTraveler21", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, Florida", "id": "34515"}}}]}
