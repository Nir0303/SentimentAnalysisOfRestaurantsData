I was out for a morning walk on a Sunday morning and stumbled across this place.  It was closed, as it always is on the weekends, but I made note of it so I could return the next day.  It is very small and only has a few tables, but the bagels are delicious.  I ordered a bagel sandwich with sausage, egg and cheese and it was prepared right in front of me.  The coffee was fresh and hot.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed as if they had their fair share of regulars coming through that Monday morning.  It does not look like much from the inside or out, but do not let that keep you away.
