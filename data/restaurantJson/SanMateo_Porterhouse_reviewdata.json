This was a good sign.\n\nUpon arrival for my reservation shortly after the restaurant opened, we taken to our table right away with no wait. We were seated in the lower dining area, at a 6 top, in a dark corner of the room vs upstairs in the brighter main room. There were just two of us. There was a lack of attention to detail - the online dinner menu does not show the grass fed options, we were not offered the pre-fixe menu, the menu at the entrance to the building did not match what we were given and our server left the additional 4 place settings at the table.\n\nOn a non-holiday, Friday night, we ordered the wedge salad with romaine vs iceberg lettuce, beef spring rolls and grass fed beef Porterhouse for two (@ $74). Shortly after that we were told that the grass fed porterhouse was not available, but we could get the regular porterhouse or grass fed t-bone. When further questioned, our server proceeded to tell us that the t-bone is the same as the porterhouse, only a thinner cut. (Unless you're in the know, that \"thinner cut\" is of the tender loin side of the steak.) As we wanted to try their grass fed beef, we went with the T-Bone. Not realising until the bill came, that were charged for two single serve steaks (@ $49 each), a price change that our server did not explain at the time we made the order change. How can you be out of a signature item and not let the servers know at the start of service?\n\nWhile the meat was cooked well and full of beef flavour, it should have been called a strip steak - the loin on my piece was a small triangle measuring in width .25\" to 1\" and about 2\" long, hardly worth putting on the bone. As I had mentioned before attention to detail was lacking, because also on my plate was a 2\" long burnt parsnip, served burnt side up. That burnt parsnip should have never made it out of the kitchen - both expediter and server should have caught it.\n\nUpon leaving, we saw why we might not have been seated in the main dining room - it was filled with a college sports team. Perhaps this might have also explained not offering a prix fix menu? Nothing was communicated at check-in or throughout the dining experience.\n\nIt was not worth the high price, average service, and lack of attention to details, poor communication and managing expectations that evening. I would not go back, even if someone else was paying.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-19T11:02:06-0400", "location_id": "1341392", "id": "420256941", "user": {"username": "Lee P", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Overpriced for what you receive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33031-d1341392-r420189230-m11068-Porterhouse-San_Mateo_California.html#review420189230", "text": "We had dinner at Porterhouse this past Friday evening, and I must say I was unimpressed. For a steakhouse that charges as much as they do, I expected quite a bit more.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted at the host stand and taken to our table right away. Since this was an early dinner (5:30) this was as expected, but I didn't expect the two of us to be seated at a 6-top table in a dark corner of the downstairs dining room. We had a reservation that had been booked several weeks earlier, it isn't like we showed up unannounced.\n\nHaving looked at their menu on the web site when we made the reservation, I was looking forward to trying their prix fixe menu. However, there was no sign of this, just a single page menu that is similar to the daily menu they have on-line. The menu you receive in the restaurant is however slightly different from both the one on-line and the one posted outside the restaurant, apparently no one has the time to walk out to the the front and change it.\n\nSince this is a steakhouse, we decided to order their grass fed porterhouse for two (not on the on-line menu) along with an appetizer and salad for each of us. They were good enough to customize the salad but the server completely forgot about the appetizer. He also came back shortly after we ordered to tell us that the grass fed porterhouse was not available but we could get the regular porterhouse or the grass fed t-bone. When questioned he proceeded to tell us that the t-bone was the same as the porterhouse only a thinner cut, which is not correct. That's like saying that a strip steak is the same as a t-bone -- they may come from the same primal but they are not the same. As many have said, all porterhouses are t-bones, but not all t-bones are porterhouses.\n\nWhat restaurant is out of their signature item at 6pm on a Friday night?\n\nAs we wanted to try their grass-fed beef, we went with the t-bone, not realizing that this was a more expensive cut since it was two single-serving steaks as compared to the the porterhouse which is priced for 2 people. This of course was not explained to us by the server.\n\nThe steaks themselves were very good. They are well aged to develop flavor and were cooked perfectly. They were not cut very evenly though, as my partner's steak was about 50% thicker than mine and was cut from further up the primal. Mine appeared to be from the every end of what can be considered a t-bone.\n\nOverall, I feel the dinner was not worth the high price we paid. The service was below average, I felt that we were dining in an overflow room, and the price was somewhat outrageous for what we had to eat. I doubt we will ever go back, I would much rather go to Alexander's in Cupertino where I can have a much wider selection, better service, and pay roughly the same price in a nicer atmosphere.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-19T07:48:44-0400", "location_id": "1341392", "id": "420189230", "user": {"username": "wwwdrich", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Very good steakhouse", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33031-d1341392-r416983469-m11068-Porterhouse-San_Mateo_California.html#review416983469", "text": "Excellent cuts of dry, aged beef that you can see as you walk in.

I engaged the online reservation option found here on TA and it worked flawlessly. \n\nI was a little concerned about finding the place after having read some of the reviews but it was in no way problematic. You can park in the adjacent public garage and have quick access to the restaurant. I parked on the roof and saw the sign for the place by one of the entries. It is near the terminus of the ramp that leads to the roof. Parking was free after 6 pm. Once you get onto the ground floor of the building, it's not at all difficult to find the place. There is adequate directional signage. \n\nPorterhouse is not decked out in contemporary trappings. It reminded me of the classic '60's or '70's steakhouse. But as long as it delivered on the chow, it mattered not to me what the place looked like. \n\nAnd it pretty much delivered. \n\nWife and I each ordered the 12-oz. cut of prime rib and my sister, suffering from an upset stomach, ordered the risotto. \n\nFor appetizers, I had the hearts of romaine, and wife had escargots. The salad was quite tasty with its authentic Caesar dressing. The escargot was great, deliciousness which was enhanced by the rich garlic and oil sauce. \n\nThe prime rib was perfectly cooked but given I was really hungry, I wished it would have been a 16-oz. cut. The presentation was elegant. The meat was flanked by a tubular twice-baked potato, broccoli, and au jus. The broccoli was just right. That's not easy to do (at least that's what I think).  Sister perked up a little after having finished her risotto. Not only did she feel better, she decided to order dessert. \n\nIn her case, it was the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  Wife and I split the bananas foster. What a production that was!  They cook it right abeam the table. When the liqueur was administered, there was a great flash of fire that shot up almost to the ceiling fan. Theatrics aside, the result was a great dessert. The reviewer who said she wanted to lick the dish - I get it. \n\nDinner here is almost obligatory for visitors to San Mateo. Don't be put off by location. Go and enjoy.

This brought us to the Porterhouse in San Mateo. The entrance to the actual restaurant is at the end of a corridor. The ambiance of the dining area is sort of Capital Grille-ish...dark wood and leather, etc., although not as elegant.  The hostess was very friendly and helpful \u2013 in fact the nicest person working there. My son really enjoyed his prime rib; my filet came out medium instead of medium rare. My wife had issues with the soup--too spicy and the waiter called over a \"suit\" (there were more male suits running about then servers) who accused my wife of putting pepper in the soup (she has never put pepper on anything at any restaurant). Her entree was a spring salad that was short on everything - not much substance.  The molten chocolate cake was very good but took forever to get.  When we questioned the time one of the pompous \u201csuits\u201d said that it took a half hour \u2013 an item they failed to mention when we ordered it. \n\nTwo non-food items: first, the public parking garages, though free, puts you far from the restaurant.  It was confusing to know which one to park in; secondly, the restrooms are not in the restaurant, but in that corridor noted above. Supposedly, there is a code to punch in, but that night they were wide open--very unsafe due to easy street access.\n\nAll in all, for the price paid and the other issues, it was not a worthwhile dining experience.
