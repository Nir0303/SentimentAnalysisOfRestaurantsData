It was a great experience...BUT...I purchased a Living Social voucher for them in August 2014.  I tried numerous times to book an appointment but was continually told that they lost their dock and to be patient.  They assured me that my voucher would not expire.  Well, today I tried again to book.  It seems they are no longer in business.  I called Living Social to try to get a credit in Living Social bucks but they informed me that they can no longer give me a credit as they don't use this company anymore.   They also said that my purchase value with Pirates Life Boat rental never expires.  WHAT GOOD DOES THAT DO ME FOR A COMPANY THAT HAS BLOWN DOORS??!!  I won't be using Living Social again.
