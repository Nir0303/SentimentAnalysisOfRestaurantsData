My best friend was throwing a surprise party for his wife there. First off...they are listed as a restaurant & lounge, the Facebook page says it's a Bistro & Night Club but they also list authentic French cuisine?? Then I also see they have it listed as a Mediterranean restaurant? Since we were going to the party my wife and I thought we would get there early and have dinner before the party. We arrived at 8:00...the party wasn't until 9:30. We were greeted at the door and the hostess asked if we had reservations. I informed her that we didn't but as we were coming for the party we thought we would just have dinner also. She told us that they had a party of 12 dining so she wasn't sure if they could serve us dinner? The place was empty...besides the table of 12 in the corner. She said she would ask the owner? We were feeling rather awkward and as she went to check we agreed we would just go elsewhere. As she came back to us I was saying we would just go and the hostess said it was no problem as long as we were ok with eating at the bar? Well...ok...then as we were seated she mentions that we will need to order fast as the party of 12 was about to order as well? We should have just left right then. The Office does look way more like a TINY night club, looking very modern with LED lights and a few Paris type large photos on the walls...not really a \"fine dining\" look at all. I ordered the Caramelized truffle pork chop....in the menu description it said, pork chops, carrots, asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes. Wife ordered Cannelloni of Escargot. No salad was offered but for an upcharge they did offer a mushroom sauce...I ordered it on the side. Our food arrived rather quickly, portions were small, There was ONE chop on my plate...it said on the menu it was caramelized...looked to just be pan seared? A carrot and several green beans were set upon some asparagus. No truffle mashed potato to be found. Pork was good, not great...the mushroom sauce was very strong...glad I got it on the side. Everything had a vinaigrette drizzle over it...to make it fancy I guess? As we were eating we noticed it was very warm...I mentioned it to our server...who was also the hostess....and was also the bar tender. She said it was a very big place to cool and they were bringing in a few fans for the party? A man who I assume was the owner came out to the bar...he greeted us and asked how our dinner was....I mentioned the party and if they were ready for the 50 or so coming in just an hour or so, I also mentioned it was warm. He said it will be ok...they would be ready. We watched as he had a few cocktails of his own. Sooo, back to the meal...veggies were almost raw...pork chop was good...I was still hungry. Oh and the chop was $25. The party was a disaster as the a/c was OUT...they didn't have enough people behind the bar and wouldn't even serve anyone at first! Most arrived at around 9:15 and were told we weren't expected until 10 pm? We all ended up leaving...even took the DJ with us across the street...they had COLD a/c and bartenders!! The Office lost a ton of business that night...worst thing is they knew the a/c wasn't working properly several days before the event...as we heard from an employee. The owner even went on my friends event page on Facebook and blasted him for the party leaving! As if it was his fault!! I know there are about 50 folks who will never go there again....to the bistro, French, mediterran...tiny night club whatever they think they are.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-25T10:03:24-0400", "location_id": "8834266", "id": "396720731", "user": {"username": "JASON F", "user_location": {"name": "Cape Coral, Florida", "id": "34118"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Superb !!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34118-d8834266-r396645980-m11068-The_Office_Restaurant_Lounge-Cape_Coral_Florida.html#review396645980", "text": "We thoroughly enjoyed our first dining experience at the The Office in Cape Coral.\nWe had a part of 5.

Our soup of the day, cram of asparagus, was wonderful, full of flavor.  We picked a lovely white burgundy to go with our seafood main courses.  My friends liked the shrimp tempura and the grouper tapenade.  My shrimp and scallops were perfectly prepared but the accompanying risotto was like creamed rice with no flavor.  It was very disappointing.  \n\nThe service is not as competent as I would expect for the prices and the quality of food.  Our sever had not been trained about \"serve from the left, clear from the right\" and to serve beverages on the right.  Thus there was a lot of reaching across us at our table.  We had to pour our second glasses of wine ourselves, although there was ample time for the server to note our empty glasses.  He DID wait for a signal that we had all finished eating before he offered to clear the table, thank you.  I saw another server set a table by carrying three water glasses in one hand by the rims.  Would you want to drink from one of those glasses which had been handled on the inside and rim?\n\nThe meal took a while, I assume because the food was freshly prepared.  The Office does not have a liquor license, but the beer and wine selections were fine.\n\nThis is a fairly new restaurant, with a while to go to train staff to meet the level of the food.\n\nThe ambience is starkly modern.  If they get busy the concrete floor may make the place a little noisy.  More tablecloths may dampen the sounds of a full house.  We could talk easily with the place less than half full.\n\nThis is a longer than usual review for me, but I do want this chef to succeed.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-27T02:10:47-0500", "location_id": "8834266", "id": "351267860", "user": {"username": "hapsburgqueen", "user_location": {"name": "Gyor, Hungary", "id": "274893"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Excellent evening", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34118-d8834266-r350194174-m11068-The_Office_Restaurant_Lounge-Cape_Coral_Florida.html#review350194174", "text": "Was a little skeptical because of some previous reviews however we were simply overjoyed by both the service and food quality/quantity.

Immediately upon walking in the door, your first response is \"WOW!\"  It has been beautifully re-decorated in very stark blacks, whites and silvers.  The old dated carpet has ripped up and the concrete floor has been refinished in greys and browns.\nThe menu is rather small, and I would like to see more choices as they find their way.  The menu does not list any side dinner salads to have prior to your meal, and wen we asked about it our waiter said that the chef can easily put one together for us -- which he did.  We had to ask for the bread on the table, and were not given any butter or oil to go with it.  I think a nice assortment of a of few breads or lavash with an oil or tapenade would add a lot to the meal as a whole.  My husband had escargot for an appetizer.  It was prepared differently in that the escargot was not left whole but chopped with cheese and placed into stuffed  shells. There was a tomato based sauce that came with them that was fantastic. For dinner I had the lobster ravioli.  I must say there was quite a bit of lobster in each little pasta pocket and it came with appeared to be lobster bisque on the top.  For dessert, we both decided to split the crepes.  I would go there just for the crepes!  They were amazing!!  The crepes were light as air and filled with a delectable cream -- YUM!\nWe visited this restaurant when it was fairly new and I think they have a few little quirks to still work out, but if what we experienced was any indication of what it will be like after it matures a bit; I say \"Welcome to Cape Coral and may you have many years of success!\"  ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-04T09:52:54-0500", "location_id": "8834266", "id": "345025825", "user": {"username": "ggh55", "user_location": {"name": "cape coral", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Amazing Food, Atmosphere and service!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34118-d8834266-r344875804-m11068-The_Office_Restaurant_Lounge-Cape_Coral_Florida.html#review344875804", "text": "My husband and I have eaten at the Office several times and I have to say the Chef who's name is Christian who I was able to meet is amazing.

This somewhat controversial food, with origins dating back more than four millennia, and which is illegal to produce in some states, happens to be one of my favorites. \n\nIf you go back on the internet, and do a \"Google\" search for \"wine to serve with Foie Gras\", the first few thousand responses will all include, in one form or another, a wine called \"Sauternes\". This luscious, late-harvest, sweet white wine is produced in an appellation within the larger region of Bordeaux, France. There are a number of similar, but perhaps not comparable, wines which might also be listed, with sourcing as diverse as New York, California, Germany, central Europe and Australia, to name a few.\n\nSo, why would you open a new (they have actually been open more than 2 months) restaurant, under the pretense of being \"gourmet quasi-French\", and not have a Sauternes on the wine list, particularly when you are offering Foie Gras? Would you open a Japanese restaurant, but not offer Sake as a beverage, or and Italian restaurant that lacked Pinot Grigio or Chianti? They do not have a single wine, on a generally inferior list, that comes even close to being comparable. The single white wine they offer, that might have even a little residual sugar, is a German wine that comes from almost the absolute bottom of that country's quality scale. Taking it one step further, they don't offer even one dessert wine from any source!\n\nTo add insult to injury, this establishment has chosen to place itself at the top of heap of local restaurants that charge far too much for a \"corkage fee\". If you are not familiar with this term, it is a charge, paid by a customer, who elects to bring in his/her own wine to consume with a meal that they eat in the restaurant. The original presumption or justification for charging such a fee, is to cover the cost of equipment and utensils for the wine service - decanters, glassware, breakage and ware washing expenses. Over time, corkage has also become a profit source for restaurateurs who put together wine lists that are so mediocre that savvy customers are almost forced into bringing their own wine with them - which is entirely applicable to this case. Again, this establishment has not a single wine on their list that satisfies a centuries-old tradition of what to serve with Foie Gras, but they choose to charge as much (or more) as the cost of an entire dinner for the privilege of bringing in your own wine to enjoy. This is, quite simply, disrespectful to patrons.\n\nI also feel sorry for the chef and those who toil in the kitchen, because being able to enjoy a fine, fairly priced wine with a well thought-out and prepared meal may almost certainly result in a dining experience that is better than the sum of the parts. Unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen here.\n\nYes, I know that \"The Office\" has received at least one positive professional review. But, that critique focused entirely on the food, and made no mention of the wine list or the potentially abusive treatment resulting from poor (make that terrible) management decisions. At the same time, if the \"cost of goods\" used to calculate their wine list pricing is justified or substantiated by the amount of their \"corkage fee\", then they are charging too much for their wine from the outset. Charging more than twice the price of what you would pay for a wine at retail is abusive and insulting, and people expecting respect should go elsewhere. Like me. Not surprisingly, there is no wine list to be found on their website.\n\nIf you think that I am being overly critical, allow me to provide a different perspective on the management. On a Sunday, just before noon (they open at 11 AM), without a single customer in the restaurant, they unequivocally refused to negotiate a more equitable corkage fee. It wasn't like they would be making a concession in front of a crowd, who might ask for the same or similar treatment in the future. They obviously preferred having no business, to some business that would have absolutely no negative impact on their food cost or very little on the bottom line.\n\nA local newspaper occasionally publishes briefs about pending or current restaurant openings. With a few exceptions, such announcements often indicate that the new establishment will be occupying space previously used by a failed eatery. At some point, in the not too distant future, I expect to see such an announcement for this location.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-02-03T09:46:53-0500", "location_id": "8834266", "id": "344802639", "user": {"username": "Paul E", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Myers, Florida", "id": "34230"}}}]}
