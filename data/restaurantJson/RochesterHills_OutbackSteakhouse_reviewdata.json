Nothing was good about our experience on Tuesday night (3-8-16).\nWe had three adults and two children in our party and arrived around 5:50 pm and were promptly seated (there were only two tables occupied). Our table was dirty and sticky.  The hostess said she would clean it & began smearing the table with a paper towel. She never bothered to really clean it and most of the crumbs were just pushed onto our chairs. We waited approx. 5 minutes for our waitress to take our drink orders and offer bread.\n\nIt was another 5 minute wait to get our drinks and bread............another 10 minute wait and we had to locate the waitress & ask her if we could place our order.  After placing our orders and eating the loaf of bread we watched other tables filling up and already having there dinners served, although we were there 1/2 hour before them.\n\nAgain I had to ask another employee where our waitress was. When she finally showed up, she said \"I will be right back.\" By this time we had been there over 45 minutes and hadn't been served and other tables were finishing up and asking for their bills.\n\nWhen our food finally showed up: both the sirloins we ordered medium were a totally dried out and tasteless well done.  The grandsons grilled cheese was served on a dried out piece of bread.......did not resemble a grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nOverall bad service........I feel from the hostess............to the cook.............to the waitress............to the franchise owner, nobody cares.
