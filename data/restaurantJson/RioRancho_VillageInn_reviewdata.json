Things have to be bad for me to say anything at a dining place. And they were. When the server told us they were backed up in the kitchen. That was  really code for THINGS ARE REALLY BAD TONIGHT JUST LEAVE. But sadly we were too hungry to listen to instinct. The hot water that we ordered was served in a coffee pot and no one even tried to rinse it out first. It looked to be about 1 part coffee and 3 parts water.  We should have read that as the second bad sign and split. But we didn't. Now for the part you all have been waiting for....drum roll......the food arrives!! Yay! We were so excited and happy! The server was happy too and she left immediately after before I could even get the words out of my mouth that we need ketchup for the fries. Okay, no big deal lets dig in. And I attempted to slice my chicken fried steak. Hmmm, that's funny I don't remember it being that hard to cut before. I will munch on a piece of broccoli while I am cutting this steak is what I thought. As I was chewing the first piece of broccoli and still cutting my steak, my eyes caught something on the other broccoli. It appeared as though the stalks were used as fat oil dipsticks when the oil has not been changed in a year. Or maybe tar. But only if had been that maybe it would not have been as much of a problem. I knew what the black stuff was. I had seen it with my own broccoli after it has been forgotten and abandoned in some forsaken corner of the frig. It is a fungus. So I asked the nice lady who was serving us what she thought it was. She immediately offered to have them \"cut it off\" for me. I said, \"no thanks\". She asked if I wanted corn or something and I politely declined and asked if she could just take it off the bill. A few minutes later she came back and described to me that they just forget to cut the ends off and they need to look through them better next time. The set off alarms in my head as I was still working on extracting some protein from the chicken fried steak. Still no ketchup which would not have helped anyway because by that time I had figured out how to use the solid fries as percussion instruments. These particular fries were not useful as food because it probably would have taken my system more calories to convert these fries to energy than what it was worth. \nAnd they gave us a 10% \"senior\" (thanks guys) discount of about 3 bucks.
