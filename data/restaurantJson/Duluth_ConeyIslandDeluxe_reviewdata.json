This time I was impressed with the cleanliness and the namesake product, the Coney Dog.  Everything was as good as you can get it if you are a Coney Dog freak.  The bun was steamed and fresh, the dog was tasty and snapped when bitten, the onions were uniformly diced and the coney sauce is the best anywhere.  Five star rating for a specialty sandwich the rest of the country could only hope to equal.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-08-17T21:57:16-0400", "location_id": "4230773", "id": "222539594", "user": {"username": "duluthharold", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Consistent after 30+ years!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43018-d4230773-r219850175-m11068-Coney_Island_Deluxe-Duluth_Minnesota.html#review219850175", "text": "My husband is a Duluth native and I consider Duluth to be my adopted hometown.  My husband and good friend used to take the money they were paid from their paper routes and head down to treat themselves to a Coney.  We also consider a stop to for Coneys to be at the top of our list when we come home (we've even stopped for Coney's first on the way to family dinners!  My mother-in-law eventually found out :) )  The buns are always very soft and warm, the Coney sauce is delicious covered with chopped onions and those Coney dogs just pop when you take that first bite.  The decor hasn't changed in all these years and it just feels like home.  Our kids also make this a priority stop whenever they come to Duluth.  Ya gotta try these!  There are other food offerings here but we haven't tried anything else.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-05T12:53:56-0400", "location_id": "4230773", "id": "219850175", "user": {"username": "ireland2010Colorado", "user_location": {"name": "Greeley, Colorado", "id": "33454"}}}]}
