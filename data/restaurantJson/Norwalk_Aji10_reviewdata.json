The restaurant describes its food as a multicultural spirt of Latin America and Nikkei Cuisine, a fusion of Japanese-Peruvian cultures.

I started out with Arepas, Venezuelan corn cakes with a choice of stuffing. I picked two types, Perni--- slow cooked pork which was juicy and tender, and Vegetarian---plantain, avocado and black beans, also delicious. For my entr\u00e9e I selected the daily special, Grilled Seafood--clams, mussels, octopus, crabs, shrimps and lobster on a mixed salad. The portion was generous, and the seafood fresh, but the dish lacked flavor. The dessert, Churros, a donut type dough filled with dulce de leche and served with vanilla ice cream was too hard.

The veggies were fresh, the portions generous, the saucing distinctive, but light, and the fish and meats done to perfection. Starting with drinks: the Pisco sour was the best I've had outside of Peru, the traditional mohito was more elegant than dramatic and Alborino was excellent. For appetizers, we went with the special baked oysters instead of the online recommendation of fried, and the short-rib tacos, 3 medium spheres slathered with a delicate combo of meat, tomatoes and the like.  The parmesean laced dressing for the oysters was perfect as were the delicate gems of oysters. My mains were a wonderful quinoa, cranberrie and greens salad that was large enough for a meal (I'm having leftovers for lunch) and a wonderful complement to the fish soup, my other main. The soup looked gorgeous with the white fish, squid, shrimp, etc clustered around a large crab leg sticking out of the center and the pieces were all large enough to eat separately and the variety reminded me of Lisbon. But the best was the supporting broth which must have been cooked for hours and had a deep, butterlike richness (no butter) without interfering with the fresh fish.  The steak was devoured to quickly by our host to taste, but I did taste my wife's lambchops and they were generous and incredibly flavorful.  She loved the scallop potatoes and said she hadn't any like these since her mother's.  We were too full and weight conscious to do much with deserts, so we just shared a passion fruit flan which was huge and stunning.  Next time the chocolate crepes. The prices are modest. In all, a memorable evening and not just because our friends picked up the bill.

My wife had a really special ensalada nueva andina that she loved.  I also had the ceviche mixto which was outstanding.  We look forward to going back to try some of the fusion dishes like the tempura lobster mixed with Peruvian aioli.
