I'm a lifelong fan of the Reuben and have them just about everywhere I go (as a first visit selection) if they have them on the menu.  They have a big selection of hot/cold subs as well as salads and sandwiches.  It was a hard decision because everything sounded so good but I decided to stick with the Reuben and wasn't disappointed.  My daughter and her friend got the A'Capello and the Burton Street and both said they were excellent.  There is not one thing on the menu that doesn't sound yummy.  It's not a matter of IF we will go back but WHEN and WHAT to order next.  As we walked in we were immediately greeted by all the guys working and I observed that everyone after us received the same warm greeting.  Ordering suggestions were offered if we needed them and throughout our lunch we were asked how everything was and if we needed anything else. We were also thanked for stopping in.
