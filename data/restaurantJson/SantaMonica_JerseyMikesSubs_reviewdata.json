As a sandwich it was ok, as a reasonable facsimile of a real philly cheese steak or sub....not so much. For the \"Philly\" the bread was wrong, the cheese was wrong and the meat was skimpy so the imitation didn't quite do it. It was an ok sandwich but not remotely like Geno's or Pat's. The sub was ok but suffered somewhat similar problems. As a side, the tastycakes which they carried were not exactly the most popular but they did have them. As a sandwich shop its fine but don't expect to feel like you were in Philly or Jersey.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-06-08T05:57:26-0400", "location_id": "6542629", "id": "209391551", "user": {"username": "Chingachgook", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}]}
