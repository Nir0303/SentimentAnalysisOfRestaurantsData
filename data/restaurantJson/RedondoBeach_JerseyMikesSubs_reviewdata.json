I've lived in CA 9 years. These subs are like the NY deli type and fresh - they make it in front of you. They're happy. It's a small little place. Take it to go.

My favorite is the Italian sub done \"Mike's way\" and I never get tired of it. But get what you want. Share a bag of chips. A fun, reasonable get-away for 2.
