( Named Reserve because the location, in the Ambassador Hotel, was once a bank's vault.)  Our servers were personable, attentive yet seemingly knew when to offer service without becoming bothersome.  I ordered the coq au vin and my husband got the lamb.  Both selections were excellent! We felt the prices most reasonable for a downtown hotel.  Servers Charles and Mary Kate personified professionalism at our evening meal.  Alex was helpful and provided not only great service but also descriptions of the menu while offering warm, genuine hospitality. Plus, Alex kept our morning coffee filled.  A good thing because it is excellent coffee!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-28T19:02:33-0400", "location_id": "3350746", "id": "304536257", "user": {"username": "67kewpie", "user_location": {"name": "columbia", "id": null}}}]}
