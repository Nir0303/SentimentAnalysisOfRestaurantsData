In terms of the quality of service, when the food was ready, two servers delivered 4 of our 7 orders and then we waited at least 4 minutes before they brought the remaining 3 orders (perhaps this was why my fries were so soggy!). \n\nThe lunch menu is a bit limited (mostly sandwiches and salads) with only 2 entree choices, so I would recommend reviewing the menu before bringing picky eaters. A few people in my group raved about the pastrami, but I am generally not a fan of that type of meat. The shrimp and grits got rave reviews as well. I tried the Shaved Picnic Friend Chicken Club served on fresh herb bread from a local bakery. The sandwich name was a bit misleading as it contained sliced chicken breast that didn't seem to be fried. Not a fan of mayo so I asked for the garlic aioli on the side but I think it would have been a good compliment. I splurged on the \"house cut fries\" as a side dish to accompany the sandwich but was disappointed in how greasy they were.  It was clear that they were fresh and homemade, just way too soggy.

This end of Main Street has just been classed up to a Destination.\n\nEast End is a rustic yet sophisticated urban restaurant. On a Tuesday evening the place was crowded, which tells you something about the fare. The well-lit bar was the sort that decent people go to to engage in lively conversation, rather than to brood. As a vegan, I had the bean soup and a Caesar salad, while hubby had the salmon. Both were attractively presented and perfectly done. Our waitress was cheerful, available, and quick. Afterwards we had the best dessert in a restaurant I've had in a year! The flourless chocolate cake with ganache was absolute perfection-- not overpoweringly sweet, but balances and restrained yet full bodied. Yes, I am a dessert snob!\n\nThe owner came around and introduced himself, which was very cool. I thanked him for the healthy vegan options, and he said more would be introduced in the future.\n\nI think we just found a new favorite restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-20T06:16:43-0400", "location_id": "10351341", "id": "394663601", "user": {"username": "Eleanor G", "user_location": {"name": "West Lafayette, Indiana", "id": "37621"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Loud , missed my value point.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37242-d10351341-r391563521-m11068-East_End_Grill-Lafayette_Indiana.html#review391563521", "text": "I eat often enough downtown.
