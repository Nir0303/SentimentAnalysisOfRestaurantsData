The line was surprisingly short, so I headed over, ordered and paid. Then went on to have my walk. They had my food ready and waiting when I came back - and the hot fingers (chicken fingers drenched in hot sauce) and fried okra were yummy as always. The side of okra is huge, so I ate my fill, and shared with my three office mates - and still had a handful to bring home.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-06-10T18:15:42-0400", "location_id": "4047810", "id": "163628718", "user": {"username": "huggio", "user_location": {"name": "Memphis, Tennessee", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "Try the fried okra!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d4047810-r159932693-m11068-A_Square_Meal_on_Wheels-Memphis_Tennessee.html#review159932693", "text": "So far everything I've tried has been very good.
