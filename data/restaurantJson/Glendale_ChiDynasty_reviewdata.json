We sat at the bar while we waited fro friends to meet the very unique and engaging bartender.  He created the entire martini menu and strongly believes in his craft, this you can tell right off the bat.  you ask him about a drink and he has a \"story\" that involves intense shaking and crystal formation on the top of your drink.  I kid you not when I say he will hand you a magnifying glass to see the crystals!  So bar is truly five stars.  The drinks were in fact amazing, we had three different types of martini's, the best one was the pomegranate passion fruit martini, simple amazing!  He muddles the pomegranate in your glass right in front of you!  So, on to the meal and service, a bit disappointing here, and overall three stars so average to four stars overall.  We were seated and they didn't have enough menu's so we got take-out paper versions... umm--- can I get a real menu please?!?  Sad part is, there were only two other tables that we could see using menus, total of 8 people, really-- you don't have more than 8 menus for a place that seats 40+ (my best guess)? Anyway, we asked for real menus and they trickled in, they were brought to our table one by one as other people finished using theirs!  We ordered soups and all were delicious, the egg flower drop was so light and fresh!  Wonton soup also very light and tasted excellent.  We ordered the sizzling chicken, mongolian beef, garlic shrimp, sliced fish in black bean sauce, buddha feast of veggies, friend rice and lo mein.  All was very good BUT it all tasted the same, like heavy savory Chinese food.  Why would garlic sauce, black bean sauce, mongolian beef--- everything taste the same?!
