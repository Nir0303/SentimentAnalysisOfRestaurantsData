For good tacos, you need to go to a taqueria. As nice as the atmosphere is inside El Jalape\u00f1o, the food falls far short of acceptable Mexican cuisine. In my opinion, when you add a large dollop of guacamole to anything, all you taste is the guacamole. This is what they did to the carnitas tacos that I ordered. It's hard to even comment on the taste of the pork when it was so overshadowed. Unfortunately, even the beans tasted like they were simply warmed up straight out of the can. In comparison, I had just had some wonderful frijoles a la Olla a few nights earlier down the road at Los Vaqueros. Those served at El Jalape\u00f1o suffer in comparison. There are so many good Mexican eateries on and around Florida Ave. that I would be very hard pressed to return here. In fact, just up the way on San Jacinto, Elena's Cafe makes a killer authentic  carnitas taco.
