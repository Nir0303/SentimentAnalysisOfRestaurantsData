Certainly better than another, not to be named celebrity owned restaurant in town\n\nIn addition to our entrees we had two appetizers and guacamole which was a lot of food. (she warned us not to get an appetizer each because they were large portions)  The Duo Empanadas and the Costarican Enyucada - both shared by my sons and husband and they said they were delicious.\n\nFor entrees we had between us the Pollo Relleno (delicious with a cilantro Tequila honey sauce that was amazing) The Caribbean Pollo Saltado (also delicious, rich but complex, Jamaican chicken curry)  The Ropa Vieja (A traditional stewed shredded beef which was very good) and the  Steak Cubano (also very good, my husband ordered rare and it was definitely cooked perfectly)  \n\nWe do eat out often in Stamford and love the variety of options, I happened upon this because it is restaurant week it is always a great opportunity to try new places.  That said we did not eat off to he restaurant week menu and opted for the normal menu and we were glad we did.\n\nLocation is bizarre as it is above street level in Landmark Square, but parking is super easy as there is an entrance to the Landmark garage literally right below the restaurant. (I never knew it was there) They have outdoor seating which would have been nice but there was a party and we opted for inside.  This is why I gave Cilantro 4 stars.  The service was particularly slow.  half an hour to get a drink and another 20 minutes after we finished our meal to get a check even though we had our leftovers already boxed.

It was so bad, we expected someone to jump out and say: surprise, you are on candid camera! \n\nOur friends invited us to the concert at the Palace Theatre on Saturday night.  As a thank you we invited them to have pre-theatre dinner at Cilantro, conveniently located across the street from the theatre.  My husband and I walked in at 6:15.  We told the waitress, there will be 4 of us, and we would like a drink before our friends come.  The waitress took my husband's drink order and walked away without taking mine.  \nWhen finally I located her, I asked if i can order some wine. I had to show her on the menu what I wanted, it looked like she didn't understand a word I said.  \nAt 6:20 our friends arrived and were seated. When we came in, I said that we are going to 8 pm show.  We need to leave restaurant no later then 7:45.  We ordered food at 6:30.  We ordered appetizers and main course.  Again, the waitress smiled and said, ok.   At 6:55 nothing arrived. We called the manager. And suddenly a young men, another waiter, appeared and asked if he can take our order.  We told him, we have ordered half an hour ago. He promised to check on our order.  At 7:05 nothing arrived.  \nI told the manager that we don't want main courses, no time.  Just bring us our appetizers.  At 740 two soups with  empanadas arrived.  And my husband got his saviche.  At the same time the fourth  person received his entree.  We ordered guacamole, never got it.  \nI had ask someone else to get us our wine.  \nMind u, the restaurant was full.  People were coming and going, all promptly seated and served.  Our table and a table next to us had nothing.  The manager apologized and said, so sorry, your drinks are on the house.\nIt was embarrassing and upsetting.   \nWe rushed to eat our food and left.   Don't get me wrong, the food at Cilantro is excellent.  We just got a waitress that was either first day on the job or was the owner's niece or girlfriend.  She could hardly speak English.  And from what  I observed, could hardly understand it.  \n\nIt is a new restaurant. However, opening a downtown location and competing with a lot of restaurants nearby requires a certain level of service and a certain level of personnel.   \n\nMy husband and I felt utterly embarrassed in front of the friends.  \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-17T10:48:56-0500", "location_id": "8795576", "id": "340758837", "user": {"username": "tgw1208", "user_location": {"name": "Stamford, Connecticut", "id": "33936"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Great Latino Fusion", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d8795576-r339403949-m11068-Cilantro-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review339403949", "text": "An outstanding Latin fusion restaurant.

Although there was a mix-up about where we were seated, and ended up outdoors in November, all went well and it was a wonderful lunch. We were a fairly large group with people milling about, yet the wait staff got every order right and found each of us, even if we'd moved to a different spot. Cannot say enough about the professionalism of the staff, and cannot say enough about how delicious everything was. We had chips and salsa, empanadas, guacamole, and calamari as big group appetizers, and each person ordered individually for his/her entree. Every single one was totally, well, delicious. Cuban sandwich, chicken and rice, steak, quesadillas - every person raved about how good the food was. I have never been a sangria fan, but there were pitchers provided and it was excellent. We look forward to returning another time.
