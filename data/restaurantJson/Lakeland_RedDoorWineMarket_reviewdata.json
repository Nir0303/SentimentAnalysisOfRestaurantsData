Neither of these details were shared with me while making the reservation.  We stayed, since we had gone through the trouble of finding parking during MayFaire. We ordered the chicken waffles and it was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary.  My fianc\u00e9 was served before me and my food took an extra 10 minutes to arrive.  \nI then, walked inside to use the restroom, only to find an empty dining room.

Made a point to have lunch at Red Door since we had heard great things about it.  Unfortunately, because of the festival traffic they had a very limited special menu- only a few sandwiches, a couple of salads and hot dog/burgers on the outside grill. My BLT (flavored bacon, lettuce and fried green tomato) on buttery Texas toast was really good.  Served with cheese sprinkled kettle chips and with the blueberry ale I ordered - yum!  The rest of our party ordered burgers from the grill which were all burned and came without the side chips listed on menu.  Staff was pleasant and atmosphere is really adorable.  \nWould I go back-absolutely but not on festival weekend.   A special occasion or weekend trip would be my suggestion to get the real experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-05-09T13:28:18-0400", "location_id": "2712848", "id": "270995127", "user": {"username": "Vicki M", "user_location": {"name": "Cape Coral, Florida", "id": "34118"}}}]}
