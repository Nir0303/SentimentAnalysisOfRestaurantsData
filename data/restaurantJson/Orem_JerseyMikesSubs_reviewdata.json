I love wraps more than I like sandwiches.  My favorite is the chicken Caesar wrap so if I can get one I do.  Well I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap from Jersey Mike's and honestly I wasn't that impressed.  The chicken to lettuce ratio wasn't right and they didn't use the correct lettuce to begin with.  You don't use ice berg lettuce in a Caesar wrap.  It requires romaine.  Sorry.  The Caesar dressing was really gross in my opinion as well.  It had a spoiled taste to me.  The chicken wasn't chunks of chicken but the same chicken used in the sandwiches.  It didn't have the right texture for a Caesar wrap.  To me it seemed like the wraps were an after thought.  My guess is they figured they had stuff to make sandwiches, why not fold it into a tortilla and call it good.  I haven't had a sandwich there so I can't say if they are good.  I haven't gone back because I spent nearly $15 for lunch between the wrap, chips, drink, and brownie.  The brownie was dry by the way.  Like it had been sitting for a while.  At any rate, I hope the sandwiches are better than the wraps and I hope Jersey Mike's stays around for a while.  I may go back and have a sandwich.

I think they've been open for just a week or two.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable, and the employees were friendly and helpful.  However, the sandwich had no flavor.  I ate half and gave up.  The ingredients consisted of provolone cheese, roast beef, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, red wine vinegar, oil, and salt.  There were a few other ingredients available (jalape\u00f1os, pickles, and mayo), but I wasn't offered any of them, so I figure they cost extra.  The cheese was sliced so thin than I could actually see through it.  The roast beef looked great when they made the sandwich, but when I unwrapped it and started to eat, I realized that it was only about 1/8 of an inch thick.  All I could taste as I ate were the onions and the vinegar.  The bread was good, but I'm not buying a tasteless sandwich for good bread.  I got the giant, because I wanted two or three meals from it.  It was slightly longer than the footlong at Subway, and it cost $13!!  I thought that was about twice what it was worth.  I also got a cookie, which I guess had been wrapped in plastic while it was still warm, because it was wet and yucky.  It tasted like raw cake batter, and it ended up in the trashcan.  \n\nThey say their cheesesteak is what they're famous for, and I might give them another chance to impress me with that sandwich.  I won't try another cold sandwich, though, and definitely not a cookie! \n\nOn the bright side, they have Diet Dr. Pepper!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-24T15:51:52-0400", "location_id": "10337473", "id": "376261548", "user": {"username": "Aqua52", "user_location": {"name": "Orem, Utah", "id": "57093"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Newly opened in Orem, Utah", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57093-d10337473-r375159044-m11068-Jersey_Mike_s_Subs-Orem_Utah.html#review375159044", "text": "We wanted to try this newly opened subway shop near our home. They have hot and cold subs, wraps, kids meals, combo meals, and desserts. My wife ordered a cold American Classic with ham and provolone cheese, and I ordered the hot Big Kahuna Cheese Steak sub with grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalapenos, and white American cheese. Then we shared bites. My order took a little longer to put together and cook, so I had a good sample of my wife's cold sub while waiting, and we both liked it. When my hot Big Kahuna arrived it was worth the wait. Since we've most frequently eaten at the Subway Sandwich shop a block away, we naturally compared the two. Jersey Mike's prices are slightly higher, but I think you get more meat and cheese for the difference. With Subway we'd get more salad filler, which is OK and probably healthier. The Big Kahuna was packed with hot beef and cheese, etc. While Subway heats their subs in a toaster oven enough to melt the cheese, then piles on the salad, the Big Kahuna is by far a better value considering the amount of meat and cheese included, and the rich taste that accompanies that.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-21T11:17:24-0400", "location_id": "10337473", "id": "375159044", "user": {"username": "Bob S", "user_location": {"name": "Orem, Utah", "id": "57093"}}}]}
