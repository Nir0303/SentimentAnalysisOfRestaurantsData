Went for a birthday party.  Childs wristband is good all day so paid for adults and stayed. The wristband allows unlimited play. This is a unique and fun place at a great price.  $7 for kids, $10 for adults. You can come and go all day with wristbands.  Love the 80's theme, 80's games, 80's music, etc.  Games are well maintained and in great shape.  Pinball was my personal favorite.  Check this place out!
