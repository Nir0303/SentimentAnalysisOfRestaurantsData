The atmosphere is small and cozy and friendly and decorated with antiques on the ceiling and walls. Also at Brad's I like that I can just drive up to a window to place my order and speak with a real person and not a speaker like at a fast food place. I have been a customer of Brad's Bar-b-q for many years and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never tried it before.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-11-22T20:14:51-0500", "location_id": "489622", "id": "145995178", "user": {"username": "mary g", "user_location": {"name": "Memphis, Tennessee", "id": "55197"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great lunch!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d489622-r141648406-m11068-Brad_s_Bar_B_Q-Memphis_Tennessee.html#review141648406", "text": "Can't beat their lunch.
