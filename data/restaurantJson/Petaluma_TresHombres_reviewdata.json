When I saw the Unlimited Brunch for 4 with Bottomless Champagne Groupon at Tres Hombres, I had to get it as we were visiting for my dad's 79th birthday and thought this would be perfect!  \n\nFirst problem...when you get the address to Tres Hombres and aren't from Petaluma...you will be LOST.  As my poor mom and dad followed we headed to where 151 Petaluma Blvd SHOULD be and were right behind a woman with a Living Social certificate looking for the same restaurant and asking a shop owner where it was.  Turns out there is a Petaluma Blvd. and then a Petaluma Blvd. South where the odd numbers are on the opposite side of the street...and this restaurant is actually inside a cobbled \"paseo\" across from a MOVIE theater, not the Petaluma Theatre that I was expecting.  SO...once we had hoofed it a few blocks we got to the restaurant at 1:30pm on Sunday.  Let me reiterate that we had a Groupon for the unlimited brunch and champagne which did NOT say we needed reservations, plus said was served from 11-2.  \n\nAs soon as we walked up we were told that they were no longer serving brunch AT ALL because they had \"run out of eggs, run out of champagne,\" etc.\n\nI proceeded to say that I was only in town for a couple of days only and that the Groupon would be of no use to me on any other day and I had meant it to be a birthday brunch.  The owner/manager (?) did allow me to use the Groupon for face value toward the lunch menu.  I was actually satisfied with this at the time, but as I have thought about it...I had purchased a certificate that had a value of 4 brunches at $19.99 each and instead they covered the $32 that I paid for the certificate.  I could have gone anywhere...hmmm...\n\nThe food was decent.  Nothing that I would write home about.  I got 2 tropical fish tacos which were very very light on the fish.  Clearly they had also run out of ice in their mad rush of Groupon/Living Social users (what restaurant puts BOTH of these out on the same week!?) as our water and iced tea had no ice.  I had to ask for utensils, straws, napkins, etc.  \n\nIt's a bit hard to blame the servers if they were completely swamped from 11-1, but they were clearly taking their breather after the insanity of the morning...no chip refills, no drink refills, nothing extra at all.\n\nAfter our experience I would probably never return to this restaurant on a future trip.  What I was hoping would be a lovely all-you-can-eat brunch with champagne and dessert ended up being a couple of stingy tacos and warm iced tea.  Bummer.  Sorry dad!
