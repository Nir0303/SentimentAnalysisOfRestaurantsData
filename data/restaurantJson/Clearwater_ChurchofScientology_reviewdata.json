My husband & I own a health care clinic in PA & travel back and forth.  I don\u2019t work for the church; I\u2019m a parishioner & I volunteer @ the Scn Info Ctr. giving tours of this bldg. & our 6 humanitarian programs around the corner.  It\u2019s a beautiful, restored historical bldg. built in 1918 & worth seeing. The Ctr. provides answers to your questions about Scn in a friendly, safe environment. We don\u2019t recruit; we simply answer your questions and, if you\u2019d like, show you videos regarding our church activities. We also have social events, like piano concerts, which many of the local residents enjoy.\n\nTo answer the other reviewer\u2019s question about uniforms, they\u2019re for staff that works for the church. Uniforms help identify staff from parishioners like me and the diff color uniforms relate to the diff jobs each person holds. Uniforms make life easier & identify a team, like those in the service, some schools or restaurants.  So if you\u2019re in CL, we invite you to stop in and say hi.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-11-16T17:04:22-0500", "location_id": "10818818", "id": "437944085", "user": {"username": "gbraadt", "user_location": {"name": "Clearwater, Florida", "id": "34141"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "What Is with the uniforms?", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d10818818-r436262561-m11068-Church_of_Scientology-Clearwater_Florida.html#review436262561", "text": "You can't complain about the Scientologists having any crime in downtown clearwater every thing is neat and in order.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Amber S, Manager at Church of Scientology, responded to this review", "text": "Hello Douglas,\n\nThank you for your remarks and reviews. \n\nTo answer, \"What's with the uniforms\", the uniforms are worn by the staff of the Church of Scientology. Today there are 2,600 staff that work in the Clearwater area. The members of Church coming for Scientology services (classes and spiritual counselling) do not wear uniforms. It makes it easier to know who to go to for the services that way as there are about 4,500 members (parishioners) visiting from around the world at any time as well. \n\nHope that answers your question, if not feel free to e-mail me at amber@cos.flag.org. \n\nAmber S. - Manager, Scientology Information Center \n", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-11-16T12:35:43-0500", "id": "437906918"}, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-10T17:22:55-0500", "location_id": "10818818", "id": "436262561", "user": {"username": "Douglas M.
