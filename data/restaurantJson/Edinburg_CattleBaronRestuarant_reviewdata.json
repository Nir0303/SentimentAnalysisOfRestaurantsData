To be more accurate, the Cattle Industry has actually moved just North of the Four Counties that make up the Rio Grande Valley.  When heading to our part of the World you will notice some cautionary signs \"no gas for next 60 miles\".  When you see those signs you are approaching the famous Ranch land of South Texas>  Though the King Ranch is perhaps the best known, there are some other sizeable and smaller ranches.  But I wander.  This restaurant of course specializes in Steaks.  They are big and good.  The decor is in keeping with it's name.

It draws a moderate crowd on Saturday mornings while the live stock auctions are going on. Been there a few times, the place is filled with cigarrette smoke, the service is bad and the food is a take it as it is kind of deal. The atmosphere is not friendly or inviting. They will provide service with an attitude. The wait staff plops your plate down and they are hard to find after that. It has that 1950's truck stop feel to it. The bar is next door and the noise and buzz filters into the diner. We stopped patronizing the place and can not recommend it.
