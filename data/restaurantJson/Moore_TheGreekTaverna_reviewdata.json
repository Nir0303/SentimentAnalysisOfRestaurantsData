So, when The Greek Taverna came along, it received a warm welcome. \nThe Food - For our first visit, my wife and I got the Chicken Souvlaki and The Gyro Plate and we were very pleased, to say the least. Our entrees were made fresh and their homemade fries were absolutely amazing. The Chicken Souvlaki was seasoned so well and the flavor was incredible. The pita bread with the gyro was soft, warm and easily folded for perfect little spoons for my gyro. \nThe staff was very helpful and friendly. They recommended various items in which they enjoyed and it was overall a great experience. I cannot wait to go back and bring my daughter. \n\nThings To Consider: \n- This place is SMALL. Large parties, probably not your best place. \n- Hours are irregular and they are CLOSED for the remainder of the summer (2015)\n- Try to go at non-peak hours for more personal service. (But definitely go one way or another).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-15T18:03:00-0400", "location_id": "3528835", "id": "289366848", "user": {"username": "MarkQ100", "user_location": {"name": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "id": "51560"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Best Greek food in Moore and beyond", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51524-d3528835-r260445813-m11068-The_Greek_Taverna-Moore_Oklahoma.html#review260445813", "text": "Great food , best around  in the Okc metro area. \nPrices are great and everything tastes good, wish they would stay open longer at night, close at 7 pm and closed on weekends!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-18T17:06:14-0400", "location_id": "3528835", "id": "260445813", "user": {"username": "Germanokigirl", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-01", "title": "Quaint Little Greek Place!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51524-d3528835-r192717355-m11068-The_Greek_Taverna-Moore_Oklahoma.html#review192717355", "text": "Yummy gyros meat as well as chicken and pork!
