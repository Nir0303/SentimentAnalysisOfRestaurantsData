The first time there was for lunch and was a mix up on my food order.  I took what they brought but in the end was a little disappointed. Probably my fault on that one.  Yes, I could have sent it back, but just didn't.  The next time, also lunchtime, the meal was delicious and reasonably priced for a 'nicer' restaurant..  They had us near the window  one both occasions and the view is great.  They also have a Tequila Bar, no one has been in there to serve us on either occasion, including one evening. Yes, we could have asked, but there was an obviously 'open' bar on the other side, so we simple 'settled' for that.  There was nothing wrong with that one but it wasn't \"The Tequila Bar\". They had 'tequila' there as well.  We had more traditional 'adult beverages' on this occasion in any case, but were looking for the 'tequila taste experience', since it is advertised as a 'Tequila Bar'.  Its not a complaint, but if you care, I would ask about the Tequila Bar as it has been undependable on two visits.  We were told you can rent one of the dining rooms if your anticipated total bill exceeds 'x' number of dollars.  I choose not to list it here because you can call them for 'your deal' but let me say with 8-10 people you would probably exceed the 'limit' to have the private room.  We are members of a Dinner Club (4 couples) and collectively we think we could make their 'limit' pretty easily.  So it's an option for a special occasion or event. The Sendera has a wonderful view of the City of Victoria, day or night and, the restaurant is definite 'upscale' but we saw some VERY casually dressed diners as we observed from the bar.  I have not eaten there at night, but my wife has and she says it \"exceeds expectations.\"  So if you want just drinks, that's a good option and you can do that one of several bars (if they are open) at The Sendera.  Any of the meals they serve have been great.  We did not eat dinner here on this most recent occasion but had some appetizers at the bar and one of those included the thickest sliced bacon you have ever seen and it was great!  We also had the \"Pepper Poppers\" and they were great too.  Those are items one and two on the 'Appetizer' menu.  Portion size is modest, but we thought just right for two and VERY tasty.  We would recommend either of those and of course they have other tasty sounding options.  It's a good place.

Great view of the city. Wicker furniture....Although it seems uppity.   Nice bar area. Nice meeting space.  We ordered pulled pork sliders. They were average.  Fried green beans were good. Autostart was great. They were very accommodating!  I would schedule another meeting there...but try different food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-11-12T13:10:33-0500", "location_id": "6018408", "id": "326362427", "user": {"username": "cyn_mgmt1", "user_location": {"name": "Houston, Texas", "id": "56003"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Way too expensive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56823-d6018408-r322156091-m11068-The_Sendera-Victoria_Texas.html#review322156091", "text": "Food is below average and prices are WAY high.

On this occasion neither one of these happened.  We had a party of 10 and were seated in a timely fashion based on our reservation time.  All seemed well, we had gotten cocktails at the bar and our waitress commented to that effect and that she would be back shortly.  We didn't see her for 15 minutes and during that time several needed beverages. \n     We ordered dinner and most of us got steaks since that is the specialty.  When our food arrived the only thing that was still slightly warm were the steaks.  They were cooked perfectly and since you always let the steaks rest before serving they were still warm when served.  All of the sides were just room temperature.  We took a poll at the table and they were all that way.  No way that should happen at this type of restaurant.  My wife spoke to the manager and he was very apologetic and wondered but at this point it was too late.  To top it off our waitress was non-caring to the point of being rude.  Come to find out since we had 10 people at our table they added a 20% gratuity automatically.  I usually tip 20-25% anyway but not for bad service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-09-09T11:45:46-0400", "location_id": "6018408", "id": "308655520", "user": {"username": "BrianEH32766", "user_location": {"name": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "id": "37743"}}}]}
