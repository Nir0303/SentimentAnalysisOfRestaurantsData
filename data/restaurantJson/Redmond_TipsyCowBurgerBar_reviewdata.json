And the add-ons - we couldn't control ourselves...avocado, deep fried bacon (that was a little much...), carmelized onions, pickles...pretty much anything you could dream of. And fries could be substituted with onion rings, sweet potato fries, and the like. The meat was cooked to perfection and juicy, the bibb lettuce was fresh and crisp. The plentiful fries were slightly over-salted for our tastes and were embellished with a few too many herbs. But the onion rings, four thick slabs, were delightful with a very crisp coating of batter.
