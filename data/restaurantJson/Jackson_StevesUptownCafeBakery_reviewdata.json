I had recently had some oral surgery and my choices for eating were rather limited and we needed it to be close to where we were at near the Planetarium. So, we went to Steve's. I had the Roasted Tomato, Black Olives and Pesto quiche. It was AWESOME. My other option was soup and the guy behind the counter let me try it to decide whether or not to order it. It was the organic vegetable soup. I ended up not getting it due to time but it was awesome too!
