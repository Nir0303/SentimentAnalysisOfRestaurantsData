We  used to regularly dine here many years ago when we lived in Simi Valley. However at that time it was Thai buffet, with good quality food & many selections to choose from, plus the cost was minimal. At this visit we first found out that it is no longer a buffet consequently fixed meals are the only choice. Although the food was acceptable I did not find it good enough to want to go back & I left feeling a little disappointed. From past experience I was looking forward to eating here once again, but I have to say I have lost that desire after this visit. If your expectations are not too high you possibly will be satisfied with the meals, but if you have other memorable experiences with Thai cuisine this may not be the place for you to seek out. On the plus side the staff are very courteous & attentive & the prices are reasonable.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-16T13:29:07-0400", "location_id": "4522531", "id": "428533766", "user": {"username": "SheriffGunn", "user_location": {"name": "Grants Pass, Oregon", "id": "51891"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Tasty Thai!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33093-d4522531-r415805611-m11068-Thai_Kitchen-Simi_Valley_California.html#review415805611", "text": "Although not exceptionally clean, the food and service are excellent here.
