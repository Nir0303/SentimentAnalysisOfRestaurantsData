First time eating here.  I had the vegetarian curry, which was around $6.  A vegetable curry, a chickpea curry, and rice, with a spoon of chutney.  It also comes with a chapati bread, like tortilla.  Mine was not buttered which is how I like it, but i bet they can serve it with ghee if you wanted.  Served in a styrofoam to go container, even though I asked for it for here.  The store has some tables (hot) and there are a couple of more outside overlooking the parking lot of the mini-mall this place resides in.  The place is kind of dingy, not a place to take a date or business meeting.  But if you are in the area and want to quick curry, it does the job.  They also have fritters (samosas or pakoras), which I did not try, but will give a taste next time.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-09-30T07:58:59-0400", "location_id": "3525937", "id": "141657657", "user": {"username": "Hitcher84", "user_location": {"name": "Camarillo, California", "id": "32147"}}}]}
