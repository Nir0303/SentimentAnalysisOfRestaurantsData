Nice talking to her while waiting. Speaking of which, I only had to wait about 5 minutes for these wings. But they still tasted fresh and meaty. You get 8 for $4.50, which is pretty standard. \n\nAs usual, I got these to-go. When I got home, I put the wings in the oven at 270 degrees for about 15 minutes. They were hot as new, but to be honest I did have to use a paper towel between the wings and the plate, just to reduce the Grease for Peace factor.\n\nI got the fried noodles, which were 95 cents rather than 75 or 50 like the competitors. But still worth the price, since they were fat ones. Nice and wide...\n\nAs for the Yum Yum sauce, it's a spicy combination of mayo, ketchup, and peppers. Cost is 75 cents per about 4 ounce (?) styo cup; decent portion. Worth the money to give it a try.\n\nI'm giving Top Wok 4 owl eyes, 'cuz it was a pleasurable experience from purchase to the last bite and burp.
