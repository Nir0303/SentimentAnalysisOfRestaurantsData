The burger was as good as ever HOWEVER, we waited over 15 minutes for our meal, at 2 in the afternoon. The first 5 min. we were in line in our car. When we got to the window we paid and waited a couple of min. Then the cashier asked us to pull over and our food would be sent out to us in 3 minutes. after TEN minutes, we finally went to the window, where we got out cooled food.

Unfortunately, this locations service and appearance are severely lacking.  I have been to this location now 3 times over 8 week period, with hopes it would improve each time before reviewing them on Tripadvisor.  Sad to say... my last stop really will be my LAST stop here.  Waited over 20 minutes after placing order and when I mentioned this, the young lady just shook her head.   I have better things to do than wait for 24 minutes on a fast food burger, no matter how good the sandwich may be.  Service has been slow on each of my visits.  Shorthanded every day?  As a manager, I would have called in other employees to cover at the very least lunch hour and most definitely keep a full staff.  The outside of the building is in definite need of paint and repair.  The landscaping is barren with the exception of weeds and cigarette butts.  Saddened because I truly do like Rally's Hamburgers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-08-10T03:32:01-0400", "location_id": "5569418", "id": "220820434", "user": {"username": "Steven N", "user_location": {"name": "Murrayville", "id": null}}}]}
