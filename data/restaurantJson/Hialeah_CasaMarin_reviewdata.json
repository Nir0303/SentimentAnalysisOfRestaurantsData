The menu for breakfast was very good, ranging from Cuban to American.\nThe quality was good, I had a FRITA CUBANA, ( a kind of Cuban hamburger that has Spanish sausage, chorizo, and beef) It was great and it was ready fast. My wife had a Cuban sandwich which was abundant in ham and cheese. She could not eat it all and took the other half home. The restaurant is in heart of the city and is always full.  Last night I drove near the restaurant and it was packed, there were cars everywhere, that is a good sign.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-11-12T07:52:34-0500", "location_id": "2369603", "id": "120502361", "user": {"username": "yoyocu", "user_location": {"name": "usa", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Comida cubana como en casa", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34284-d2369603-r415494319-m11068-Casa_Marin-Hialeah_Florida.html#review415494319", "text": "Exelente lugar para comer comida cubana como en tu propia casa.
