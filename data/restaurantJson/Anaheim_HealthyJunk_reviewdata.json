I got the regular skinny fries, chili cheese fries, AND their sweet potato fries. So yes, this is basically a healthy(healthier) fast food restaurant which happens to be vegan. I was surprised that some of their menu items actually seemed pretty healthy; though, after simply reading their menu online beforehand.\n\nThey had various types of juice offered, the one of which I had was great.\nThe sweet potato fries definitely were the healthiest of the few, they seemed like they had little to no oil, and perhaps they were baked. The ranch sauce that came with the fries definitely made them more outstanding in my opinion. \n\nThe one comment I have is that when I ordered I was not given a number to take when I sat down, though to be honest I'm not sure if that was by error of the employee working or that I simply was not fully paying attention when I paid - BUT there weren't that many people there and all I had to do was explain to the girl when she brought my juice that I did not get a number and she just brought everything to me.\n\nOverall, the food was worth what I paid, and the employees were very nice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-10-01T19:38:56-0400", "location_id": "3368985", "id": "424250832", "user": {"username": "Sarrie C", "user_location": {"name": "Maryland", "id": "28941"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "I had such high hopes", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29092-d3368985-r420869515-m11068-Healthy_Junk-Anaheim_California.html#review420869515", "text": "Average quality, not much of a selection, small portions and not cheap\nThe BLTA had chewy \"Bacn\" and wasn't very warm.
