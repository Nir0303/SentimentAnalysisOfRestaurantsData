When we got there, we were seated in the back of the restaurant...even though there were plenty of seats up front. \n\nWe selected our appetizers, and then the server suggested we get a different one that included the two we had ordered. What he didn't say was that it was more than twice the cost of the two we ordered. Everything was an up sale. We ordered our entree, and were asked \"soup or salad with that?\" The way it was worded made it sound like it came with the meal...it didn't. Again, it was an additional cost. Don't get me wrong, we don't mind paying good money for good food, but I don't like feeling like the server was being sneaky. \n\nThe food was just okay. My husband's pasta was overcooked and my veggie lasagne was huge, but didn't have much going on. I asked our server what was in it before I ordered it and his response was \"vegetables.\" I asked if there was a lot of spinach in it and he said no. Well, I think I found one carrot and a few zuchinis, but the rest of it was nothing but spinach. The chocolate mousse cake was the best thing we ate.\n\nAs for the entertainment that we were looking forward to, we asked when the singer would begin and whether we would be able to hear him in the back where we were. We were told that he moves around and sings at each table, so we would definitely be able to hear him. Well, he never moved...stayed on the stage with a small speaker, so we couldn't hear him.

What she received was chicken on a bed of pasta bereft of Alfredo sauce; no butter, no cream, no cheese, and the garlic was burnt. My Veal Piccata was no better; a strange breaded pasty mess and a watery gruel that was supposed to be mushroom risotto. We couldn't eat either. I had mine boxed to be polite because we like the waiter but dumped it in a garbage can in the downstairs bar.\n\nThe degradation of the place showed in other ways as well. It was seven o'clock on a Saturday evening and it was half full/empty. Not a good sign for any restaurant. All this seems to coincide with the departure of a senior bus person who seemed to hold some sway with the operation of the restaurant, and on occasion sometimes cooked. Mere coincidence?\n\nDespite a sheer fondness for the staff and ambience, it will be awhile before we go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-19T06:28:47-0400", "location_id": "851161", "id": "266594227", "user": {"username": "Frank M", "user_location": {"name": "Sparks, Nevada", "id": "46002"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Pietros not Pedro.

It was upstairs in a funky building surrounded by bars.  The decorations are a little dated and cliche, with a single fake flower in a vase on each table.  We were the only people in there.  The waiter brought out bread that was mediocre at best.  It tasted like that pre-seasoned garlic bread from the supermarket- too salty, and powdered garlic flavor.  Then we got the soup.  Super delicious home-made minestrone.  It wasn't tomato based like some minestrones, but was full of herbs and veggies.  It was exactly what I wanted after a day of skiing.  I would have been happy with just a bowl of soup, it was that good.  I ordered penne puttanesca, and it was perfect.  I could tell the sauce was homemade.  The portion was huge and I took home half of it.  I would have preferred half the portion and fresh pasta (not dried), but for the price, it was good.  The sauce was just awesome, full of whole capers and large chunks of kalamata olives.  My husband had linguine with seafood in a white wine garlic sauce.  I had a bite and it was good,  It was full of huge pieces of various seafood.  We didn't have dessert.
