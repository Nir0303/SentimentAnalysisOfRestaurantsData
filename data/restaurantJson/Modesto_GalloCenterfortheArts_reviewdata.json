We found that these two performers were very good and I would recommend to go see them if they are in your area,  The only thing that keeps me from rating this very good was not the performers, but the visitors in the area right in front of the stage.  These women consistently kept snapping photos, and shooting video of the performers even thought that was against the rules. The constant flashing back light on their Smart Phones were a distraction to those of us that were in the balcony area or even floor level behind them.  We registered a complaint with the Gallo Center Management about this, but they said they are trying to keep patrons for doing these types of acts.\nI suggested that they ask for all cell phones from all of the attendees and their answer was that might not be possible do to the need to have available contact from, family, friends or doctors might cause them a law suit. I pointed out if they placed one of their people up in the balcony they could see who was in violation and then call one of the others to come a escort the violator out of the facility there by solving every ones problem.    \nI do recommend going to the Gallo Center when ever there is an event scheduled that you are interested in going to see, however you might want to ask any representative of the Gallo Center if they have taken care of the people taking pictures and videos of the performers.
