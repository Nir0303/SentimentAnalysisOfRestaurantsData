Our visit was a Friday night. I believe this was all the cooks fault and does not happen all the time. When we arrived at the Terrace Restaurant it was about 7:30 PM. Only two other tables in the whole place was occupied. That brought up red flags to us but we chose to stay.\n\nMy husband ordered a Miller Genuine Draft. The waitress came back and said they did not have that. She said they had Miller Lite so he ordered that. Ten minutes later she came back and said they were out of Miller Lite. He then ordered Miller Lite.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and the Pecan Walleye which we specifically asked for them both to be served together.\n\nWe did not time it but it seemed like at least 30 minutes and the waitress came out with the appetizer and and no Pecan Walleye. The Walleye came about 10 minutes later. It was horribly overcooked and and very hard and barely edible. I was embarrassed that I brought my husband to this establishment. I was raving about this hotel and how I book so many clients here and how impressed I was with the Radisson.  We got the Walleye off our bill. We left hungry and went to another restaurant.

The chef, and staff should be ashamed!  This not only reflects on the restaurant, but the Radisson too.  Upon arriving, we noticed one table with 6 patrons, and one other table with two.  We waited, and waited, and waited.  No restaurant staff in sight.  Finally after several minutes someone walked through and noticed us waiting and had someone come out and seat us.  Our waitress took several minutes to appear.  We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer immediately.  After quite some time, our waitress reappeared, dropped off the mushrooms, and took our order.  We each ordered Steak Oscar, one medium and one medium rare, both with au gratin potatoes along with the vegetable medley and bread that came with the meal.  The mushrooms were terrible!  The crab was fishy tasting and upon pulling the mushroom out of it\u2019s indentation in the plate; a gross brown liquid pooled in the indentation.  A sign of fishy tasting crab meat is a lack of freshness-in other words, it was old.  And the pooling brown liquid comes from the dish being made up ahead of time, like the day before and sitting until some poor shlub comes along and orders it.  Our dinner salads were small plates of some aged/brown-tipped lettuce thrown on the plate with three cherry tomatoes and three baby carrots bunched together on the side.  Truly, I\u2019ve seen better plating skills at fast food restaurants.  After nearly 50 minutes, the Steak Oscar came. Both were over cooked and both filets were so tough you would have sworn the cut of beef was a flank or chuck.  After several minutes of waiting to send them back, with no waitress in sight, we decided to proceed.  The food truly, was inedible!  The fishy tasting crab was so thin and runny, and mixed in with a thin tasteless sauce (which the menu claimed to be Bernaise), both had run off the steak and flooded the plate-it was so thin.  To finish it off, they had taken three asparagus spears about six inches long and just threw them onto the steak.  I have to believe they had a monkey plating back in the kitchen, it was such a poor job.  The mini bread loafs-one came okay, the other came RAW INSIDE!!!  I am not exaggerating here!  The loaf was raw and doughy inside. The au gratin potatoes had tasteless cheese, one would have done better with Cheez Wiz or Velveeta.  The potatoes were so undercooked, they actually crunched when you ate them-it was like eating a potato raw!  And to top off this terrific meal, the vegetable medley, with broccoli, and cauliflower, was over cooked and mushy!  I had one bite of my steak, two of the potatoes, and one piece of mushy broccoli.  And they still had the hubris to charge us for the meal!  Please, in the future, anyone wanting to do a dinner and the symphony-I strongly suggest eating elsewhere.  McDonalds would be a far better choice, and they are only one block away.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-11-27T11:51:33-0500", "location_id": "4567187", "id": "186106861", "user": {"username": "TraveLotsnLots", "user_location": {"name": "Bismarck, North Dakota", "id": "49709"}}}]}
