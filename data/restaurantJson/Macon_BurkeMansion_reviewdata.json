When we returned in the evening after having a nice dinner at Natalia's, we found a wonderful dessert tray waiting for us in our room. We knew then that we were in for a treat in the morning! Breakfast was delicious! Unlike most B&Bs, it was nice to have a selection to choose from. Before leaving, we made reservations to return for a special occasion. We can hardly wait to spend another night in this beautiful home.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-20T19:02:00-0400", "location_id": "10069393", "id": "384464822", "user": {"username": "Suzanne C", "user_location": {"name": "Murrayville, Georgia", "id": "35139"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Fab Night in Macon Georgia", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60920-d10069393-r382569211-m11068-Burke_Mansion-Macon_Georgia.html#review382569211", "text": "The Burke Mansion has been beautifully restored and furnished.

Pictures don't do it justice!  Don is the best!  He is the most friendly, gracious, and warm host!  He is always close by to offer refreshing drinks, wine, and snacks.  His knowledge of antiques, which fill the home, and of the history of the home and area are amazing!  Breakfast was amazing and fit for a cover photo on Southern Living magazine!  Downtown has many very nice restaurants as well.   We have been to many bed and breakfasts over the years and the Burke Mansion is in a class all its own!

It met our expectations and more. Don't be put off by the large wrap around porch that needs some work. The owner, Don, is in the process of meeting all the requirements and regulations that you have to jump through when you're restoring an historic property.\nThe interior is gorgeous, and the furnishings look like they were original to the house. Every time you step back into a room, you see something that you missed the first time. Don and Pino have both collected so many beautiful thing, (Don't miss the clock collection and Don's collection of china.).\nA big plus for us was the antique elevator that helps so much with luggage when you have to deal with stairs.\nDon was the perfect host, friendly, knows the history of Macon so well, and even drove us to and from the restaurant we chose for dinner!\nWe stayed in the Martina and Mae Suite and it was lovely. The bathroom was small and had a pedestal sink, so didn't have much room, but that's to be expected since this was originally a sewing room and was converted into a bedroom. The lighting was very good, I really appreciated that when putting on makeup. (So many (B&B's and hotels have such poor lighting.)\nThe food, breakfast, Hors d'oeuvres in the afternoon and dessert at night (homemade cookies and coffee), was delicious! You are given a choice of the time you want your breakfast and can pick what you want from 3 or 4 items. My husband had Stuffed French toast, so good, and I had the Belgian Waffle, equally as good, with a choice of breakfast meats. Very, very good and the table was so pretty. \nWe enjoyed our stay so much and will definitely will stay there again next time we are in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-30T08:05:40-0400", "location_id": "10069393", "id": "377957733", "user": {"username": "shasmith1", "user_location": {"name": "Andrews, SC", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Luxurious find in Macon...simply the best experience ever!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60920-d10069393-r377714012-m11068-Burke_Mansion-Macon_Georgia.html#review377714012", "text": "Was visiting family in Macon for the weekend and stumbled across this hotel on the internet.  Originally planned on staying at your run of the mill Hilton or equivalent but boy am I glad we chose this place instead.  First allow me to say Don was the most attentive and gracious host who attended to our every need.  He made us feel as though we were old friends visiting from out of town, not just clients.  Everything about the mansion exudes luxury.  The decor was immaculate, meticulously designed.  You immediately feel invited from the minute you pull into the driveway.  We spent most of our time on the large veranda enjoying our complimentary glass of wine and chatting with Don.  We stayed in the \"Mary Burke\" room which is one of the two largest guest rooms in the mansion.  We felt as though we had the entire mansion to ourselves even though there were other guests staying.  We even cut our time short with family to come back and enjoy the evening at the mansion...LOL!  Breakfast was exquisite.  We had the recommended french toast benedict with applewood bacon.  Our only regret is that we stayed for one night.  We will definitely visit again whether we are in Macon or just passing through.  This mansion alone is worth visiting Macon.  I encourage anyone to experience this magnificent place, you will not be disappointed.  Can't wait to go back.\n\nThanks Don & Pinot!\nSincerely\nAnthony & Keisha", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-29T13:03:00-0400", "location_id": "10069393", "id": "377714012", "user": {"username": "Anthony A", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
