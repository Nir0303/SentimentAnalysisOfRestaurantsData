Unfortunately there is a second, I was disappointed to hear about the service you received, absolutely unacceptable.  I feel the need to address this with the appropriate staff to ensure there is not a repeat occurrence.  At your convenience would you be able to tell me the date and time you joined us?  If you should ever encounter a situation like this again please feel free to ask for either Kevin or myself, between the two of us we are here 95% of the time.\n\nThank you,\nHoping you give us another opportuniy.\n\n", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-02-08T15:01:24-0500", "id": "345974856"}, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-06T09:18:03-0500", "location_id": "7289023", "id": "345417337", "user": {"username": "roadtripdeb", "user_location": {"name": "seattle", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Pretty good for a second date.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58702-d7289023-r333797826-m11068-Prime_Steakhouse-Redmond_Washington.html#review333797826", "text": "A little on the pricey side but food was generously portioned and tasted great.
