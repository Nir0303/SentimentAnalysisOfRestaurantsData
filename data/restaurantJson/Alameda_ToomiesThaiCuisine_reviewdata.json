I hope they change ALUMINIUM soup serving bowls to stainless or ceramic as ALUMINIUM IS VERY HARMFUL to our health (Alzheimer disease catalyst). They serve it with flame through the hole in the middle of the bowl.\nI told them about aluminum. Will see...

Pretty standard Thai.  The people were very nice, spoke English well enough, and the food was all you'd expect.  Affordable.  Like many Thai places, they are reluctant to go \"full heat\" on the dishes when asked.  Same goes for this diner, so if you are insatiably seeking spicy heat, make it very clear to them, lest they will hold back!\n\nI also got the \"fresh rolls\" which were typical, but fresh.  I asked for different types of dipping sauces, and they accommodated me. \n\nStreet parking is scarce in this part of Alameda, but there is a public lot just behind the buesiness across the street.  There is a marked, lit crosswalk for crossing, but be careful.  People are not paying attention. \n\nThis place was recommended to me by the girl at the Hampton Inn down the road, which is also a nice place to visit.
