The Steak Pit seemed to be a good choice. It was good for the steak, but unfortunately not so for the fish. I ordered a salmon, which was dry, obviously indicating it had been frozen before and did not taste very good.  The rest of our experience was good. However,  living in mid-America I am used to much better pricing when it comes to steak houses like this. Of course,  we understand that when you stay at a resort you have to pay the price.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-21T16:04:37-0500", "location_id": "448697", "id": "334318331", "user": {"username": "Kalistrat", "user_location": {"name": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "id": "51697"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Fabulous meal!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57128-d448697-r329577862-m11068-The_Steak_Pit-Snowbird_Utah.html#review329577862", "text": "This place is a goldmine!
