My favorite- they have unlimited mussels mid-week- call and ask.  Parking might be a problem- it is limited to street parking but it is more likely to be wide open mid-week.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-25T13:42:59-0400", "location_id": "1151070", "id": "396910392", "user": {"username": "VIAJERO225", "user_location": {"name": "Lynchburg, Virginia", "id": "57919"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Where is the Veal and the Professionalism?", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57919-d1151070-r392709752-m11068-Main_Street-Lynchburg_Virginia.html#review392709752", "text": "I ordered the veal.  The meal came on a very hot plate, so hot that I had to wait some time to begin eating it.  After a few bites of mushroom and potato, (where was the veal?) my tongue and mouth began burning from the amount of pepper in it.  I told the waitress and she returned it to the kitchen.  They adjusted the sauce and returned it to me with my half eaten potatoes.  Ugh, a fine restaurant replaces everything on the plate before returning it to the client.  And by the way, the waitress made a  point of telling me that the chef tasted my meal and did not agree with me that it was too peppery.\n   Very, very, little veal was included in the meal.  It would have been better named as \"Mushroom and onion stew with bits of veal.\"  Our waitress disappeared after that and she never came to our table again.  It seemed as though it was the bartender who came and asked if we were finished. At that time, I said that I objected to paying top price for veal, which was mainly mushrooms and onions.  She very snappishly said \"we will take care of it,\" and proceeded to angrily take our dishes away. They did not charge me for my meal, but I was embarrassed and humiliated.  I couldn't wait to leave.  Where was the manager and where was the chef?  In a quality restaurant they would have both been to my table immediately upon a complaint. \n   On the other hand, my husband ordered the expensive lamb and was very pleased with the quantity and taste.  So order well and don't complain, and you might be happy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-14T17:28:21-0400", "location_id": "1151070", "id": "392709752", "user": {"username": "hghstandards", "user_location": {"name": "Forest, Virginia", "id": "57740"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Excellent service, great atmosphere, good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57919-d1151070-r390544517-m11068-Main_Street-Lynchburg_Virginia.html#review390544517", "text": "We found the Main Street eatery by accident-- we were looking for somewhere special to eat for our anniversary.  We had passed Main Street Eatery, and decided to try it.  As we were ushered to our table, we walked by the dessert cart and decided we would definitely be staying for that!  Sara waited on us, and was pleasant and friendly.  When she found out it was our anniversary, she brought us complimentary sparking cider (they also have a champagne option, and their wine list is extensive).  She answered several questions we had about the food, decor, etc.  Big Band music was playing, and apparently that is a nightly thing.  The newer decor boasts brick interior walls with mirrors hanging everywhere, and updated benches with throw pillows.  The menu changes often, depending on what the chef can get fresh, and the desserts are absolutely fabulous!  We ordered the seafood crepes--rich, savory, and buttery-- and the steak frites-- tender, grass-fed beef with rosemary butter.  The desserts topped it all!  We had a hard time deciding, but finally we split the Chocolate Loving Spoonful-- more than enough for two and absolutely delicious.

A large perfect martini arrived from the bar along with a Rob Roy for my appreciative husband. We ordered the mahi mahi and the duck with pomegranate demi-glace, both of which were extraordinarily delicious. Dessert is not to be missed, as pastries are a specialty of the house, and the arrival of the European style dessert cart is a cause for celebration.
