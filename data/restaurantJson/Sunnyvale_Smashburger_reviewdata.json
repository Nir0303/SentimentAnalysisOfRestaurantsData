This restaurant is located in a very busy location with places such as Trader Joe's and Chipotle.  Chipotle was packed so we decided to try Smashburger which also had a waiting line.  It was lunch time and parking was hard to find.\nFood was very good and seemed very fresh---but probably not very healthy; although there may have been healthier choices on the menu that I didn't notice since things were so busy.  The best part was that 2 of the children ate their burgers.  The third is a picky eater and wouldn't eat his hot dog but we can't hold that against Smashburger!  The veggie burger was delicious and the fries  were excellent.\nI would return to try more of the offerings.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-04T06:20:28-0400", "location_id": "7903559", "id": "295629654", "user": {"username": "Ellen G", "user_location": {"name": "Spring City, Pennsylvania", "id": "53733"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Pricey, big servings, lots of options, delicious fries and shakes", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33146-d7903559-r292821150-m11068-Smashburger-Sunnyvale_California.html#review292821150", "text": "Smashburger is only the latest in a long string of hamburger chains to settle in the booming Silicon Valley.  \n\nIt's in the same shopping center as Chipotle, Starbucks, Pasta Promodoro, Trader Joes, and  PF Changs.  Within a half mile are the new guys on the block: Five Guys hamburgers, Habit Hamburgers, and In and Out hamburgers.  \n\nHundreds of parking spots, but hundreds of cars parked, and dozens circling like vultures, looking for openings  \n\nThe wife and I walk 11 minutes from our house to the shopping center, me in shorts with my smoky white, thin cross strap Birki sandals . \n\nOutdoor seating packed under sun umbrellas, with full size windows floor to ceiling.  \n\nI go in, with the wife, and a birthday coupon for a free milk shake.  Bright colored solid painted walls, with regular and high bar tables.  Place is very clean, not only the tables, but the seats and floors.  Didn't use the bathrooms -I never use restaurant bathrooms for lunch, but prefer my workplace or home bathroom.\n\nMenu on the overheads above the cashier. \n\nThe wife orders the $7 truffle mushroom burger, while I order my $7 make my own hamburger, with a beef patty, lettuce, tomato, raw onions, pickles with ketchup on an egg bun.  \n\nPreviously I had tried the regular smashburger, but didn't care for the mustard based smashburger sauce.  Also rosemary flavored fries were not my favorite.  \n\nWe ordered one fries, and one strawberry milk shake.\n\nThe shake comes first, and is absolutely to die for.  I would have ordered a second, but the wife and I would have required a second set of larger clothes, for a bulging waist line! \n\nThe fries and burgers come within a few minutes of ordering.  The fries are cold, and we get a free second order of fries.  Still too salty, but tasty as narrow thin fries.\n\nThe hamburgers are flattened out from smashing, and taste fine.  Lean burger, with lots of flavor and juicy, not dried out.  Large serving, leaves me smashed over -time for my afternoon nap! \n\nWe get out of there for $17, with the lunch so filling that we didn't need dinner, except for vegetables.\n\nSmashburger is good, but I still prefer In and Out hamburger first, and charcoal grilled Habit Hamburger second.

The employee that took our order was super nice.\n\nThey have a great menu (see pic) with burgers, chicken sammiches and \u201cmake your own\u201d burger/sammich options with a great variety of sides & salads.  I got the Buffalo Burger and my son got the Truffle Burger.  I got fried pickles and he got fries.  \n\nWe both agreed that the food was super tasty and we would totally go again.  The fried pickles were hands down the BEST fried pickles I\u2019ve ever had.  My son did say that his \u201clarge\u201d burger could have been larger but that\u2019s coming from a growing teenager.  The total was $23.00 for both meals including 2 drinks.  Not bad at all for such large portions on the sides.\n\nThe thing I really loved that set the place apart from any other burger joint is that the meals were individually bagged and labeled rather than all shoved in one as is the norm.
