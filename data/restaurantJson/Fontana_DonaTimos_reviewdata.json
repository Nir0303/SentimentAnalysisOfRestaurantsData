The prices are fare, the service is good, the owner now has two sites and I always see the owner/ wife bussing tables, serving food, she is attentive and very polite.

Don't be fooled by the unassuming looks.  The food here is fresh and full of wonderful, unique flavors.  They specialize in seafood dishes and the quality is superb.  The prices are extremely reasonable especially for seafood dishes and the portions are generous without being overbearing.  Everything is properly cooked and the wait staff is friendly and efficient.  They do have a small traditional musical group that comes in on Friday evenings -- they were very good but I must admit to not really caring for live bands while eating.  That being said, the food here is so wonderful that I would not hesitate to go to Dona Timos at any time of day including for breakfast.  With so many Mexican restaurants in Fontana, there are many good choices.  If you want to make sure you get something great, you can't go wrong here.", "helpful_votes": "5", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-09-30T11:28:04-0400", "location_id": "2293135", "id": "118790379", "user": {"username": "KoHoSo", "user_location": {"name": "Crestline, California", "id": "32265"}}}]}
