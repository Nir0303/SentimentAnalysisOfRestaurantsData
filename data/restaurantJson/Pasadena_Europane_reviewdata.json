The pastry is delicious but not very sweet.  Coffee is robust, fresh and blended right.  \n\nThe cafe is popular.  Even on a weekday morning, the cafe was full.  There was a big wood table in the lobby so we all enjoyed a happy coffee break with other coffee lovers.\n\nThe location of the coffee shop is super good.  In the shopping area and on the route of Rose Parade.\n\nThe floor was a little bit messy due to the heavy traffic.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-12-22T17:57:08-0500", "location_id": "4802198", "id": "334522149", "user": {"username": "flora z", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
