Okay...however when she returned she said well it's not in the refrigerator so it will be warm. So obviously I did not want it. I asked about her Tequila since I cannot drink beer/whisky due to gluten-related health issues. She had a very few choices but I found one that was 'okay'. I found it odd that it was served in a plastic cup...Tequila neat in a plastic cup??? Odd? Once my clients got there they started ordering shots and while I took the drink, I sipped mine because that's how I roll...but what struck me as odd is that she would fill theirs about 2/3rd full and mine about 1/3rd full (of the plastic Tequila neat plastic cup) AND weirder than that, she joined them in taking the shots. So apparently it is perfectly fine for bartenders at this establishment to get drunk while working. That does not impress me. There was also not one thing on their menu that I could eat, but that's because of my health issues. Next time, I will use that as an excuse to get out of going there again.
