My husband and I were initially going to IHOP or Dennys but we figured let's try something new.  And we were glad.  They have menudo every day, they are are open 24/7 and their food was really good.\n\nWe came here for breakfast.  I had the menudo and my husband had the Lucky breakfast.\n\nThe only downfall to my plate is they served it with grilled buttered hot dog bread instead of torillas.  It came with the mohogony and pork.  This is odd to find.  Most places give you one or the other. I ordered a small one and got full.  \n\nMy husband had 2 eggs, 3 pancakes, and 3 slices of bacon with an horchata.   The pancakes were not fluffy, but they were not super thin.  They were medium thickness.  He wasn't asked how he wanted his eggs, but he got them over medium.   The bacon was a bit on the crunchy side, but delicious.\n\nThis place is very small and was packed.   It is a bit tricky to find parking, but as ppl were finishing up their meals new customers were sitting.  It was constant movement and all the workers were busy.   There was no standing around waiting to find a seat.
