Multiple restaurants are close by--some within walking distance.  And, given our predicament, I'll add the value that multiple auto dealerships with repair facilities are also nearby.  Laundry facilities with multiple washers and dryers exist on site, all of which were working.  \n\nMy only complaint is that it appeared that water had gotten into the laundry soap sold on site, making the boxes warped and the soap crusty.
