Their breakfast potatoes are awesome......garlic and herb seasoned.......and the omelette was superb.......herb and swiss.  My friend ordered a latte and it was beautifully made and she said it was excellent.  They also have a bakery counter with breads, pastries, and desserts, all beautiful.  So glad to have found this place so close to home!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-29T12:54:33-0400", "location_id": "464110", "id": "398948547", "user": {"username": "RuToo", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Best breakfast of our week long stay in the area", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58537-d464110-r398722503-m11068-Wild_Wheat_Bakery_Cafe_Restaurant-Kent_Washington.html#review398722503", "text": "The crab and asparagus omelet!!

Our visit to Kent WA was brief, but our first meal was at Wild Wheat, and it was delicious. I had Eggs Benedict and my spouse had Eggs Florentine. Both dishes were spectacular. Due to the shortness of our stay, we did not return to WW although there were other dishes I would have loved to try. Our server was delightful. What a joy!
