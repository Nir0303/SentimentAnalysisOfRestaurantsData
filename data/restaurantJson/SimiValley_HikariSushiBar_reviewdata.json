The service was good and the selection of sushi rolls was great. The types of rolls were very creative and FRESH! For dinner, it's $26.99 a person. It's 22.99 at lunch. Once you are seated, you get a menu with pictures of the rolls, complete with descriptions and a check list to place your selections. There's 3 \"ordering slots\" but each slot allows you to place any quantity you want. It's a great way of ensuring that you don't order more than you can eat. And if you do, there's a $30 charge for not finishing your meal. Thank goodness for the different slots because by the second order, I had to throw in the towel. My favorites were the eel, salmon, albacore, shrimp tempura double fried roll, baked green mussels, Simi Valley roll, dynamite...okay, let me just say there wasn't an item that I didn't like.

It was located on the corner of a strip mall with glass all around and a ramp leading to the door.  As we entered we were greeted by the entire staff with one swift \"Hello\" or perhaps it was \"Welcome\" it could have been \"Get Out!\"  I'm really not sure because it was in a foreign language but we were greeted all the same.  We were seated right away at a table in the middle sized, single room, cafe style Sushi bar.  The room was clean and the staff was quick and friendly to help out.  They offered all you can eat but since it was our first time we decided to play it safe and just try a Boston Roll and a Salmon Tempura Roll.  We tend to find that if restaurants can get the \"basics\" right that the more advance plates will be even better!  While waiting for our food we were \"treated\" to the smell of the miso soup that several other people had ordered across the room from us.  Although I have smelled this soup being served before in other Sushi restaurants I was taken aback by this particular rendition.  Smells tend to take us back to our childhood, favorite memories, and sometimes unfortunate disasters.  Have you ever had the unlikely privilege of breathing in the fumes associated with a large aquarium that is several weeks overdue of being cleaned?  You know, the kind where the green algae so coats the inner layer of glass that it is hard to see inside?  That is where this miso soup smell took me back to.  And it lingered for almost our entire lunch.  Once we were served our rolls we happily started in on them.  Overall they were nice but basic in taste.
