I was taken aback as I headed for their 'restroom'. On the way there were things lying around in the narrow passageway. I also had a glimpse of their kitchen and the preparation room. Oh boy! What a sight!! I wondered, wasn't there an authority to check on such restaurants. Such unsightly kitchen, I have never seen in the UK. How would they cover all 80 people if they turned up together?! Work surfaces were cluttered up. How could any one work in such cramped and small kitchen?\n\nAny way. My amazement didn't just end there. I had to use the 'restroom' or toilet in English. I stood there and looked for an electric switch because the toilet was dark. Then I thought, may be it will automatically light up on entering. But, no such luck. I started fumbling for the switch on either side of the door. I soon found it and switched on the light. But, the switch itself was rather precariously fixed to the wall as it was rather loose. I locked the door from the bolt provided and I sat down to do my business. Suddenly, the door swung open and hit my knee. Well, that bolt was of no use.\n\nI returned to my table and waited for our order to arrive. Little did we know that they were in the middle of taking a lot of stuff, utensils, the barbeque etc etc. A lot of workers kept on going in and out marching right through the middle of the restaurant for at least 20 minutes. We were just about to cancel our order and leave. Then some one came over and we explained that we had waited long enough.\n\nWell, the whole experience was rather disappointing. But, I must admire the quality of food. It was reasonable to good. But the serving was not what I would expect. I ordered the semolina onion crepe. It was good but in four folds. The little sambhar bowl and three chutneys bowls were placed directly over the 'onion rava dosa' served with a large spoon not fit for the sambhar bowl. \n\nI had to remove all 4 bowls before I could dive into the crepe, which was quite flattened with weight of the 4 bowls. The next shock was the 'masala' or potato onion sabzi. The potato size was so large that just 2 pieces made up the whole 'masala'! I had to call for knife and fork to cut them into eatable size with the thin crepe. But, the large pieces of potato were rather taseless as the spices hadn't penetrated thoroughly.\n\nWe had also ordered 'chana bhatoora' and multilayered pratha. The plain flour dough was not cooked right through. I think they should try 'chapati' flour or use yeast for the 'bhatoora' to make it more palatable. As 'bhatoora' cools it becomes more rubbery.\n\nI'm sure they could get special serving plates with 3 or 4 bowl positions. And, should also improve on cutlery. \n\nOverall. I'll give 2 out of 5.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-16T09:50:55-0400", "location_id": "2456580", "id": "406220234", "user": {"username": "Sat G", "user_location": {"name": "London, England, United Kingdom", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Good Vegetarian Indian Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d2456580-r405779440-m11068-Navaratna-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review405779440", "text": "Navaratna is the only authentic vegetarian Indian restaurant in Stamford.\n\nPros: They have good selection of both South & North Indian menu and their dishes tastes good.\n\nCons: Sometimes you need wait longer since the dishes are freshly prepared.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-15T10:27:01-0400", "location_id": "2456580", "id": "405779440", "user": {"username": "KKA76", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Dinner and lunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d2456580-r403773790-m11068-Navaratna-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review403773790", "text": "Have been there three times.

So it took some persuasion to get him to go to Navaratna one evening before the concert.   I have  been there twice: for lunch and dinner.   I love that place.  Great food.  Lovely ambiance.  Friendly staff.  You can say, it is a good Indian Reataurant because of the patrons.  Majority of patrons were From India or surrounding countries. It is always a good sign.  Why I know? My husband is very sociable, he loves talking to people, asking about their favorite dishes etc.   long short story short.... My husband loved it.   It is a vegetarian restaurant.  But what a treat!   I didn't  miss meat at all, and neither did he.    I would though recommend the staff smiling more.  Nobody likes grouchy waiter.  \n\nWe will be back ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-19T12:12:20-0500", "location_id": "2456580", "id": "333915076", "user": {"username": "tgw1208", "user_location": {"name": "Stamford, Connecticut", "id": "33936"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Best indian Vegetarian food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d2456580-r328892563-m11068-Navaratna-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review328892563", "text": "Our favorite restaurant in Stamford.Great service, value for money(In Stamford), wide varieties.\n\nFriendly people and best Bisibellabath from Ramesh. ;-)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-11-24T15:07:17-0500", "location_id": "2456580", "id": "328892563", "user": {"username": "Santosh R", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Best Indian Cuisine in Stamford.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d2456580-r322012066-m11068-Navaratna-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review322012066", "text": "1.
