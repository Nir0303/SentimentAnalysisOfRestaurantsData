I always mean to try something new but inevitably order the chicken quesadilla because it is sublime. Light and fluffy yet crispy outside, the tortilla is packed with shredded chicken that has been simmered in mild gravy... the Quesadilla Especial dinner plate I ordered this visit (#38) came with 2 quesadillas and salad (lettuce, tomato, guacamole) and cost just $8.59. My dining partner enjoyed the Burrito Deluxe dinner for $10.89, this included 2 chicken burritos in sauce, with sour cream, salad, rice and beans (#40). Both meals were good plain cooking, made fresh to order. If we came at lunch time the meals would be a few dollars less but the plates would still be piled high. We had nibbled on hot corn chips and cool salsa while we waited for our food, so after one quesadilla each we were too full to get dessert! Pity because the desserts are unusual and tasty. \n\nThis is a casual neighborhood diner, nothing fancy. Eat here for the good plain fresh filling food, do not expect a fashionable romantic venue. I have no clue if the cuisine is authentic Mexican but I like it a lot, and think the food at HOLA is better quality than served in the Mexican establishments mentioned in another HOLA review.
