Deleted first review and wanted to add additional information. Drove up from Saint  Augustine Florida to attend my 50th High School class reunion. Chose the Candlewood Suites because of location and great value. I am and IHG Platinum Elite member and always try to use the IHG group of hotels when I travel. This hotel is centrally located to all areas of downtown Mobile.  It is extremely clean , great pay for parking, very conveniently located outdoor pool with BBQ grills for your use as a guest, good workout room, laundry area and small general store. As a Platinum Elite member I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite on the first floor. Found the room clean and very spacious. This hotel is perfect for families traveling as the Suites are a small one-bedroom apartment with full kitchens completely furnished. This hotel is located just one hour from Gulf Shores Alabama one of the Gulf Coast Premier Beach. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance of this hotel. The staff at the front desk was very nice, and very efficient.

We were in the area for a dance competition. It was close to where we needed to be.\n\nThis place is not fancy but clean, the staff polite and friendly, and we loved the overall size of the room, the full kitchen, some full size appliances we shopped before arrival)  - other then the stove and the coffee pot is small, dishes, a few pots, a little utensils to cook with and enough utensils to eat with, dish soap, a small amount of dish washing soap, one roll of paper towel, etc. is included and you can ask the staff for more, then ample storage space and seating space for us four. You can borrow small appliances from a cabinet in the lobby like a crock pot, waffle iron, etc..  There is a seperate living area from the bedroom which was kind of small but was adequate for us and you could also sit at the ample, long counter in the kitchen. The place was quiet.  The bed and couch was comfortable. The bathroom had ample space for moving around, enough towels though the counter top area was small. \n\nThere is a small and limited parking area behind the building Self parking fee: USD 8.00 per day and they do have additional parking across the street. Ask at the front desk and they will give you a parking ticket. Park in the lighted numbered areas and spots. The parking lot is old, which is fine but looks questionable at night. We were fine but play it safe. \n\nWe did not use the BBQ Grill, the pool, fitness area, the laundry facility or get a free newspaper. We just didn't need them. Pets are allowed and there is a charge. Call ahead for pet requirements.\n\nWe did buy items from the little hotels grocery store inside the lobby. There was bananas, yohurt, cereals, milk, water, other drinks and other stuff. It was kind of expensive but convenient since we shopped at Publix in Daphne first before heading downtown and did not get any breakfast items. For some reason I thought breakfast was included with our hotel. It is not. There is free coffee. But, you can make it in your room if you wish.\n\n We would stay here again and recommend the place. Good value for the money and close to places to see in the downtown area and not far from other areas or even Daphne. It was about a 20 min. drive or so on a week end from Daphne to this hotel.
