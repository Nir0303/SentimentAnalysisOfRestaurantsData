That was for sure I got a Carnitas and carne Taco plate and my husband got a taquito plate. There was a lovely landscaped outdoor eating area with a fountain. I noticed a few B's hiring around it and I'm not allergic so I didn't think anything of it. But as soon as our food came out they started swarming. Not bees, Hornets. They're attracted by the smell of the meat and no matter how many times I tried to swat them away with my hand or napkin or eventually my shoe, they kept coming. We even got up and moved to a table that was farther away from the fountain and they kept following us. It made the dining experience overall unpleasant. We didn't even finish really.
