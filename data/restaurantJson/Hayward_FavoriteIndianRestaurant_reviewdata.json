The lunch buffet is a great value and the dinner buffet is even better.  I go at least 3 times a month.  It is addicting.  There is not one thing that is not to like.  Is it the most authentic Indian food around?  Probably not.  But is it the most delicious with the fastest service and a friendly staff? Yes, yes, and yes.

It's usually got a nice mix of traditional dishes such as aloo gobi, tandoori, channa masala, saag, etc.   They consistently offer at least 3-4 fresh veggie selections in rotation.  If you get a chance to try any of the dishes with roasted peppers or the bhindi masala, don't miss them.\nYou'll also see a selection of traditional south indian chaat items such as idli, upma, etc, on the buffet which is ambitious.\n\nThe waitstaff can be a little bit goofy, so if you're not up for banter, just don't engage....my teenage niece was very embarrassed by our regular waiter.\n\nTop notch value on the buffet.   The evening is off the menu only, but they do a very servicable dosa and south indian thali.\n\nNot the fanciest or most regional Indian food you're going to have, but pretty danged good for Hayward, and a great value!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-31T07:55:42-0500", "location_id": "467758", "id": "336249619", "user": {"username": "chuttipen", "user_location": {"name": "central coast", "id": null}}}]}
