Have stayed in several Kimpton properties so were looking forward to it.  We were checked into a large room on the top floor with 2 beds and a nice seating area.  Small bathroom compared to room.  This room was next to something to do with the hotel's air conditioning and there was a constant noise that never stopped.  Avoid this room if you don't want constant noise - it is 1016.  After 2 nights we asked for a move because of this noise which we were given with no problem.  The second room was also large and with a nice seating area.  The bathroom was also very small compared to the room and the air conditioning did not reach it so it got a little warm.  Bath with shower over bath, shower gel etc in dispensers attached to wall - not our favourite.  Room facilities fine, however the room in general (and the hotel itself) looked a little tired.  Worn carpet, slightly damaged furniture, heavy velvet drapes which had seen better days.  Very large mirror attached to wall and dusty behind, as was under the bed plinth. The hotel advertises tea and coffee in the lobby every morning as no machine in room (you can ask for a coffee machine in room).  We drink tea in the morning and every morning there was either no tea or only limited herbal - no black tea.  Every other Kimpton we have stayed in has had much better selection, so this was very disappointing.  There was no attempt to obtain any other teas for guests, which should be easy enough.  Hotel has no dining room so if you do eat it is in the bar area.  Breakfast is available and a limited evening menu.  We did not eat at the hotel, as a number of restaurants in easy walking distance.  Kimpton hotels have a wine hour every day and this was no exception.  Very welcome after a day's sightseeing.  All staff very helpful and friendly.  Could not fault them.  Also organised us a car to the airport.  Would look at alternative properties if staying in Washington again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-27T12:47:14-0400", "location_id": "84092", "id": "422934529", "user": {"username": "Travelstar51", "user_location": {"name": "Rochdale, United Kingdom", "id": "580426"}}}]}
