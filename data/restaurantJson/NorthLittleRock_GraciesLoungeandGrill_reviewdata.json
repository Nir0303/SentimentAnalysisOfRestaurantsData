(That it was a Sunday is important because you almost can't find a drink on a Sunday in Arkansas.)  Gracie's was all but dead and Tiffany was the only one working.  She and I discussed my preference in whiskey, which happens to be Crown, more specifically Crown Special Reserve.  She mentioned that they also had Crown XR for $12.  Initials aside, Crown XR is extremely rare and usually quite pricey.  (A good deal at the liquor store for a 750 mL bottle is $105.)  Anyway, service was great, food looked delicious, prices were outstanding, and the pours were generous.  I will be back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-12-02T17:32:03-0500", "location_id": "7288982", "id": "242629702", "user": {"username": "DanNowlan", "user_location": {"name": "Arlington, TX", "id": null}}}]}
