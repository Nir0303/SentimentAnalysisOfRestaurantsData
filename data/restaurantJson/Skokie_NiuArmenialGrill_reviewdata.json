Though the menu is varied, I generally only buy the lunch special ($5.50) but this still leaves me many options. There are several components of the special you get to pick between. Choose from rice pilaf, kasha or potato as a base under the chicken, steak, lamb AND falafel that come with the special. Then pick from slaw or salad and from a variety of additional sides and sauces. If you are lucky enough to get the older gentleman preparing your order, you'll be impressed with the time and artistry he puts into even a small side of hummus, or the number of sauces and seasonings he puts into a falafel wrap. (Speaking of wrap, I highly recommend asking them to swap out the default home made bread that comes with each order for a warm piece of wrap. Much tastier in my opinion.) Be prepared to try something new. Better yet, go with a friend, order a variety and sample from each other's plates. Even for the dishes that share a name with middle eastern food, it don't taste quite the same, but just as good. It doesn't help that the food isn't labelled and the preparer's English is not so good. As much as that sort of thing normally bothers me, I've yet to be disappointed by the food. Not as great a value as the lunch specials were before the remodeling, but in the months since re-opening, they've made some adjustments to the prices and returned to the original recipes, making Niu still a great deal for a very tasty and filling lunch. Worth a trip to Skokie, even if you're a jaded Chicago foodie, just to give it a try.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-03-17T19:17:39-0400", "location_id": "7757336", "id": "260237847", "user": {"username": "george s", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Fresh, flavorful, great value", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36707-d7757336-r257521661-m11068-Niu_Armenial_Grill-Skokie_Illinois.html#review257521661", "text": "Rarely do I find a restaurant that serves healthy, great tasting food at a competitive price.
