This is the go to place for pizza for my wife and I.  We also like the lasagna.  It is not a pound of cheese that is 2\" thick.  The lasagna meat is finely ground and mixed with the ricotta, very good.  The eggplant parmesan is one of the best.  It is not all bread crumbs and thin eggplant.  The eggplant parm is what I order the most.  Greek salad was very good. I have also had the Shrimp far Daivlo, which I will order again. They start you out with some garlic buttered bread which disappears quickly. My wife favors the pasta, the spaghetti with meatballs or the tortellini marinara.  The red sauce is basic and very good.  Best part is it is BYOB.  The owner and staff are always very nice and personable.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-23T14:08:59-0400", "location_id": "9807352", "id": "421596291", "user": {"username": "shambhalaa", "user_location": {"name": "Irving, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Very good and reasonably priced", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56032-d9807352-r411191926-m11068-Di_Rosani_s-Irving_Texas.html#review411191926", "text": "Three of us went for lunch today to Di Rosani's and everyone found it to be a hit. Two of us ordered pizza by the slice while the third had the Chicken Marsala. \n\nThe pizza slices are very large and are true New York style pizza - a nice thin but sturdy crust that hold up well against the toppings. My only complaint is that I wish there were a bit more meat and cheese on the slice but the flavored were very good. Plain cheese runs $3.00 and with a topping $3.25\n\nThe Chicken Marsala came with a side salad and bread while the entree was accompanied with pasta. Portion size was quite large. \n\nEveryone enjoyed their lunch and it was added to our list of lunch spots.
