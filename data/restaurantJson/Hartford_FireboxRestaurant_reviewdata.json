Note- the restaurant uses local growers for as much of their menu as they can. Go to the website and check it out. Quite a nice history and they are part of the neighborhood revival effort going on in that part of Hartford. \nWe were seated on the covered patio.\n\nDrinks:I ordered a morning freshener, an O.J./pomegranate/ginger beer Zip. Self-explanatory and quite good since the ginger beer syrup is hand made by the chef. Non-alcoholic and this could be healthy as well. \nJoanie got a latte which she really liked. Sean had a glass of wine, Devon had water...\n\nThree appetizers: 1.) White Bean Hummus/dill dip with CoCo flour bread. 2.) A small plate of veggies for dipping. I'm use to conventional chickpea hummus so this was a nice surprise with, of course, a white bean flavor. Lighter and thinner consistency. The dill spread on top added some texture which helped the hummus. I didn't eat the bread but did try the veggies. Very good!\n\n3.) Also had the sauteed brussel sprouts in a sweet base of, what, I think was either honey or molasses. Probably the latter. Pieces of almond for a crunchy experience.  Really incredible taste so I highly recommend trying this with a few people because it is a large share-plate.\n\nJoanie: Hamburger and fries. Burger tasty and cooked to perfection. I tried one of the fries and this is not the way I like them. These were left soaking in the oil and had a harder consistency so not my thing. She didn't eat them either. The only part of the experience that surprised us both. \"Head-strong chef butts head with normal-fries public taste .\" I don't think these will last long on the menu, hopefully they get a clue.\n\nI had the salmon cakes with a squash pasta garnished with the Bearnaise \"egg-Benedict sauce\" and  tomatoes. I consider this style \"cake\" a fish cake so I'm not going to go into too much detail because it was very good, though I am use to much more texture and flavor. I think this was just a native chef -inspired recipe. Joanie makes fish cakes that have a chunkier texture with lots of flavors so maybe I'm just spoiled. As I said, these were very good and I would have them again.\n\nSean had the mussels in a mystery sauce that he really enjoyed. Devon had the egg-Benedict with veggies since they were already out of the eggs-Benedict with salmon. We were alll so hungry so everything was very, very fresh and delicious.\n\nWe ate outside on the covered patio but I did go inside to check out the rest of the restaurant and it was very upscale. The brick building was rehabbed in that area and they did a great job.\n\nI recommend it and would go back to try out some of the other eclectic local-growers fare. It's also good to support this effort to go beyond the menu and use local businesses. The chef isn't afraid to veer off the standard path into uncharted waters so any criticism here is solely based on my own likes and dislikes in my comfort food zone. Everything was very good and I am sure you would fine a lot to like on the menu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-18T08:11:07-0400", "location_id": "856093", "id": "393955090", "user": {"username": "jessejames4", "user_location": {"name": "New York", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Nice farm to table.

First of all the restaurant is in an old brick building which gives it a really cool vibe and atmosphere. The staff is professional and knowledgeable. The food is fabulous. I had the duck and my boyfriend had the steak. We also shared a cheese plate appetizer. Everything was cooked perfectly, very fresh and delicious. I understand that they use locally sourced meats and vegetables and it certainly does taste it. The best part of the evening was the fact that my boyfriend arranged to have a beautiful bouquet of flowers set on the table for me when we arrived.
