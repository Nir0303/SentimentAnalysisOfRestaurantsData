They serve breakfast and lunch and the menu is huge.  They have salads, sandwiches, burgers, etc as well as a daily hot food special i.e. picadillo with beans and rice.  The daily special is listed on their website.  The portions are large and well priced for the area.  The owner is fun and friendly.  The breakfast is great and they recently added fish and grits to the menu.  Even though they're usually packed, the wait is surprisingly short.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-09T16:01:13-0400", "location_id": "10459524", "id": "381247050", "user": {"username": "Demelza T", "user_location": {"name": "Tampa, Florida", "id": "34678"}}}]}
