The entrance is in the back of the strip mall off of 4th street and it's VERY narrow, like a home driveway, then you will cross a pot-hole filled dirt lot to circle around the back to the front. Then you'll be lucky to find an empty parking spot and the only way to egress is to back up...there's no exit from the front. \n\nOnce inside, there is a lot of selection: ice cream, donuts, sandwiches, teas, bubble teas, bobas, smoothies, coffee, bottle drinks, etc. It's a large snack eatery. I didn't care for the donut that much, and the coffee was not very fresh. The smoothie was very good. Service was polite. BUT. There is a .50 surcharge for all credit transactions regardless of how much you spend...and I wasn't wild about being told that AFTER our food was prepared.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-16T16:50:10-0400", "location_id": "10887858", "id": "419304924", "user": {"username": "Kauai-Biz-Traveler", "user_location": {"name": "Riverside, California", "id": "32978"}}}]}
