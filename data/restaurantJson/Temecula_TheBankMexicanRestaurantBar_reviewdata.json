The ooold west.  Or something.  A nice place to spend a little time.  \n\nWe'd happened into town and just walked around until we found this place for dinner.  It's called The Bank because it once was, by available accounts, once a bank.  That's part of the place's charm.  \n\nI had an enchilada (1 item of the possible 3 item combo) - beef with black beans, and my wife had the Carne Asada, rice and refried beans.  I tend to judge Mexican restaurants on my first visit by the taste of their salsa and their enchalada sauce.\n\nAt first, we were disappointed in the intensity of the salsa - and asked for something with a little more kick.  We were promptly given a large bowl of something with more kick that we mixed with the first, rather bland, style.  We were pleased with the result.\n\nMy wife made some sort of comment to the waiter about the chef's apparent salt-phobia or salt-consciousness that she felt had gone a bit beyond what was cautionary (breaking my rule about never saying anything even remotely negative to someone who has yet to deliver all the food to the table...).   It was a bit bland, but as I pointed out, that, unlike the \"Chopped Kitchen\" the tables at The Bank come replete with salt shakers.  Use them.  That worked.\n\nThe enchalada?  Maybe even 5 stars not the four.  The carne asada?  Same.  Great. Why the four stars instead of 5?   Ummmm...   as someone else on here commented: there's a restroom problem - or maybe it's a general Old Town problem since we noticed a sewage smell when we were walking on the sidestreet beneath \"Luke's\" rooftop bar and grill.
