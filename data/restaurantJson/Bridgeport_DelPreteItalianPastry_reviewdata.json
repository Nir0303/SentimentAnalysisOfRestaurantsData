Located on Main Street in this old industrial city, the storefront is easily accessible off of Route 8.  The shop is non-pretentious and features cookie and pastry cases overflowing with traditional Italian pastries.  Cannolis, Babas, and Sfogliatelle are our favorites and we are never disappointed with the quality, freshness, or taste.\n\nBy far, however, the hallmark of Del Prete's is their Italian Rum Cake.  Available in various sizes (9 inch being the smallest) the white cake is layered with pudding and fruit fillings.  Great rum flavor (subtle without being overpowering) accompanied by a wonderfully light frosting.  To complete the visual and taste appeal, the side of the cake is covered with nuts and or chocolate shots (I like 1/2 and 1/2).  The cake is moist without being soggy.  The flavors subtle but not hidden.  In my opinion, this is the finest rum cake available.\n\nIt is worth a visit to try their signature dessert and you will not be disappointed.  Do not attempt to make your first visit on a holiday weekend unless you are prepared for a very long wait.  A line stretching out the door - down the sidewalk - and around the corner is a testament to the wonderful experience that is Del Prete's.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-04-02T19:57:53-0400", "location_id": "4989442", "id": "361055676", "user": {"username": "Gaelic_Gypsy", "user_location": {"name": "Seymour, Connecticut", "id": "33913"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Del Prete Italian Pastry", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33726-d4989442-r355726421-m11068-Del_Prete_Italian_Pastry-Bridgeport_Connecticut.html#review355726421", "text": "Del Prete is the best Italian bakery around.
