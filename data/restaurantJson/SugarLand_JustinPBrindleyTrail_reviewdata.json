Also the mosquitos were unbearable.\n\nThe only BAD part about this trail before the flooding was that people like to walk on it. This is a MOUNTAIN BIKING trail with lots of obstacles, both natural and man-made, and tight corners and I have almost run over walkers.

There is a .35 mile connector trail that takes you to the .75 mile south meadow loop that is adjacent to the Brindley Trail. This loop has a tower where migrating chimney swifts can spend their summers. The Brindley Trail, which is my favorite is a 1.3 one way hiking and biking trail that meanders through a heavily wooded area along the Brazos river. The are two lookouts where you can relax and watch the river flow. The trail is also a challenge course for road bikes, so you do have to watchful if you are walking or running. The terrain is uneven so you get a good workout - there are even a few mini-hills, but no roots to trip you. If you take time to look and listen you\u2019ll see and hear all sorts of wildlife.\n\nThere is also a great dog park that is very popular. There is ample parking both by the main lake loop and the dog park (which is closer to the south Meadow and Brindley Trails). There are restrooms adjacent to each parking lot.", "helpful_votes": "17", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-12-28T05:30:01-0500", "location_id": "3725961", "id": "148205860", "user": {"username": "realst8ace", "user_location": {"name": "Sugar Land, Texas", "id": "56723"}}}]}
