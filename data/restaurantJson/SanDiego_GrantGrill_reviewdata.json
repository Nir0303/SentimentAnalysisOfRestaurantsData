We visited the grill twice. Our first visit was superb. The exceptional service from both the ma\u00eetre d and bar man made the visit. The bar was full when we arrived due to a pre theatre crowd but we were made welcome and we were quickly made comfortable. The cocktails were superb and we enjoyed chatting with the bar man as he made them. A really great experience. \n\nWe returned a couple of days later (last Friday). There was live jazz on in the bar, which was lovely. We ordered wine (again great.) Unfortunately this visit was somewhat spoiled by poor customer service. We ordered the cheese and meat platter to accompany our drinks. When it arrived it was underwhelming and not as described in the menu. The menu suggested there would be different meats, in fact there was just one ridiculously small piece of ham.   The cheese was a described however the piece of blue cheese was just the rind, the actual cheese was no longer there (it looked eaten, but I am sure it wasn't, I imagine it had dropped off whilst being plated).   It was not a great concern just a little disappointing, we continued to enjoy our evening. The issue came when the waitress came over to enquire if we were enjoying our meal. I didn't intend to complain, but seeing as she asked I explained the issues. She responded in a very abrupt way. She said sometimes the platter comes as described, sometimes it doesn't, it depends what they have in the kitchen (?). She said she would feedback my comment about the strange non-piece of blue cheese. She thanked us for our feedback, apparently it is always useful, and then she abruptly left.  This is not the response I expected in a luxury hotel. The staff from the previous evening were not there that night, I would imagine they would have been a lot more responsive. \n\nWe did order room service during our stay and the food was excellent, so this inconsistent level of service was disappointing. We intended to dine at the Grill the next evening, but following this negative experience we decided to go elsewhere. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-11T22:09:18-0400", "location_id": "481916", "id": "404374058", "user": {"username": "shopkitten", "user_location": {"name": "England", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Best breakfast on our trip", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d481916-r403034368-m11068-Grant_Grill-San_Diego_California.html#review403034368", "text": "I had the egg sandwich with potatoes.
