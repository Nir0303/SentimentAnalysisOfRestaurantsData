Very quaint like the area it is in.  The food portions are smaller then big restaurants but good enough.

It is not on the menu but I had read a good review on the OC weekly about it and asked for it.  It was delicious (green sauce).  The week prior I had the chiliquiles plate so expected the burrito to be just as good.  I have already been back a couple of times for the dirty horchata. Its horchata with expresso.
