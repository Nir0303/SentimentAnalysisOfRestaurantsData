I know there dinners are very good and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Well my anticipation was as good as it was going to get. Upon our arrival we were greeted with a rather rude direction of where to sit. There was a variety of food but it really lacked any type of real home cooking. Since I am a true southern boy I was really looking forward to some awesome home made biscuits and gravy. I had to wait 30 minutes for the biscuits, When they came out they looked like someone just blobbed the dough on the cooking sheet and threw them in the oven. They tasted so chalky and were very hard. If this is Homestead best country breakfast then Y'all don't know country breakfast. The gravy I am almost sure came from a can at Publix and I should know I buy enough of it. In conclusion everyone can have a bad day but ill be hard pressed to bring my family here again after all the bragging I did and to see the disappointment on their face was not a good experience. The help really needs to be a little more friendlier to those she hasn't seen before.
