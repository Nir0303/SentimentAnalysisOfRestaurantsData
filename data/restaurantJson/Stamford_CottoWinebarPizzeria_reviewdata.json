The food arrived in a timely manner, was hot, and was really delicious.  Best of all the prices were not crazy sky high like so many of the upscale eateries in Stamford.  The fried calamari was tender and tasty, and the beet salad was strong as well. We all had pasta for our main dishes which were all terrific.  The homemade Tornnarelli Cacio and Pepe was the best pasta dish we tried.  The restaurant has a good wine list and this coupled with strong service made for a great meal.  On a Saturday night the place was packed and had a great vibe.
