It's a self-service place, which is fine, but after you sit down it takes forever to get your food.  We waited almost 20 minutes for a cheese steak, burger, and chicken tenders.  Nearly everything was wrong on the cheese steak.  It was missing the lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, and it was very average or maybe a below average sub.  The burger was the best thing we had, but the fried onions were actually ice cold.  That only happens if they were not fresh and were pulled out of the fridge.  That's rather pathetic!  I've never experienced that with a burger.  The fries tasted good but they were extremely soggy, so that quality ruined them.\n\nMy daughter's chicken tenders were extremely dry and very generic, and the honey mustard was missing honey.  I mentioned it to to waitress and she said, \"somebody must have forgotten to the put the honey in again.\"  I asked if this happens very often, and she said, \"all the time.  It's either no honey or too much honey.\"\n\nWhere do these places find such useless employees?  Nothing was cooked right, service was slow, and there was absolutely no attention to detail with anything.  Even the napkins container and ketchup bottle were empty at our table.  And to make matters worse, we paid almost $35 for this debacle.\n\nAnd another thing I witnessed was the breakdown in common sense on display when two employees were helping a couple with a baby.  They had the baby in a car carrier and there were no slings or chairs in which to place the carrier.  So the genius employees turned a high chair upside down so the car carrier could fit inside the bottom, now facing up.  This would have been fine but the chair bottom was rather grimy and the chair top, now facing down, was uneven.  And then they walked away leaving the couple of the baby wondering what the freak just happened.  It was both stupidity and carelessness on display.\n\nStay away from this place!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-11-08T03:20:25-0500", "location_id": "7783217", "id": "325218912", "user": {"username": "David S", "user_location": {"name": "Richmond, Virginia", "id": "60893"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Late night dining ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60903-d7783217-r324978985-m11068-Rex_s_Downtown_Grill-Frederick_Maryland.html#review324978985", "text": "Came here after a late night of drinking.

We came out of the parking garage across the street and there was Rex's! We went to look at the menu, not sure what they had or what we wanted, and when we walked up to the store front, there appeared to be quite a few people inside. Not crowded or busy though. The sandwiches sounded great, so we went in. We were immediately greeted from the young lady behind the counter and placed our order. I had a roast beef & cheddar sandwich on sourdough. You got to pick your fixings, which I like, so I don't have to pick off anything I don't like. The sandwich was stuffed with tender, sliced roast beef, but not pile so high that I couldn't get my mouth around it. The bread was soft too. It came with fries, although you could pick another side, and they were hot, crispy boardwalk-style fries. The meal was delicious. And not outrageously priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our food and the ambience, even though they had TV's for the football crowd, it was not noisy. I would definitely recommend and go back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-14T13:14:32-0400", "location_id": "7783217", "id": "318708511", "user": {"username": "Heidi W", "user_location": {"name": "Waldorf, Maryland", "id": "41420"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Gorgeous restoration to historic building", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60903-d7783217-r304646158-m11068-Rex_s_Downtown_Grill-Frederick_Maryland.html#review304646158", "text": "Met a friend for lunch and was delighted with the recent renovations to this grand old building.
