I have known about Jimmy's Pizza for decades but have never eaten there.  I have been saying lately when we come through downtown, that we need to stop and try it out.  I have heard so many good things.  Tonight my wife and I and my 23 year old son ate at Jimmy's.  Very, very good!  First of all, I don't eat any Italian and am very picky,  The have several items on the menu for those kids or picky adults who don't want Italian.  I had a double cheeseburger plain with cheese only.  Since I am picky, I eat them plain.  It tasted very similar to the burger I get a Five Guys, which is excellent.  I also had a generous portion of fries, all for $4.95.  My wife got the lasagna, and it looked authentic and wonderful.  She loves Italian and said this was some of the best she has had.  She ate about half and said, \"I really can't eat any more right now but I really want to.\"  I looked a few minutes later and she had almost finished the rest of it.  My 23 year old ordered Tortelinni, and it looked just as good.  He thought it was wonderful and it was also a large portion.  \nAnother clue that this restaurant serves excellent food?  We were there at 7pm on a dark, cold Friday night in downtown High Point, which is deserted on winter nights.  As we walked in, we had to wait on a table and there was a line of locals waiting almost the whole time we ate.\nThe lasagna and tortellini were both under $8 and I think you can share a plate for 50 cents.  \nThe restaurant is not large and roomy, but cozy and has the feel of a family diner.  There are booths available for 4 people and 2 people, but nothing for larger groups.  There are also about  10 stools at the front if you prefer to sit at the front counter and eat.   We all agreed that we will be coming back on a regular basis.
