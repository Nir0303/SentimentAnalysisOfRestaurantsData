We got lucky and found parking right outside. The place is not big and was pretty full, but we got a table right away. The hostess and the server were very friendly. We ordered Wiener Schnitzel and Jager Schnitzel. Oh, sooooo good!!!! Wish the portions were bigger, but it was lunch after all. The restaurant is covered with Austrian memorabilia, so much fun.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-26T08:13:57-0400", "location_id": "670695", "id": "367840265", "user": {"username": "meintexas67", "user_location": {"name": "San Antonio, Texas", "id": "60956"}}}]}
