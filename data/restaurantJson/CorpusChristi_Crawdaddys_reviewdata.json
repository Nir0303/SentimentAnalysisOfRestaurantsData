We have been to this location a few times, which is more a bar than anything with minimal seating for diners.  This is one of the only places in town that you can get crawfish, and it serves its purpose for that.  I usually come for the all-you-can-eat crawfish, which is expensive at $25, but I love crawfish so it's worth it on occasion.  The crawfish are smaller, but cooked perfectly and the seasoning is just out of this world.  In fact, we buy their seasoning and always keep it on hand at home and use it in almost everything.  You can buy it at the bar.  The sausage that comes with the crawfish is juicy and perfectly cooked.  The go-to, and only choice for the crawfish lover in Corpus Christi.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-11T08:12:32-0400", "location_id": "404645", "id": "228305503", "user": {"username": "Chris E", "user_location": {"name": "Douglasville, Georgia", "id": "34907"}}}]}
