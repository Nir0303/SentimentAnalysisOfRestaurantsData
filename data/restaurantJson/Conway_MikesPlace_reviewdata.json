When we have guests visiting-we take them to Mike's Place.\nThe food is great and the service even better. This is a college town with 3 Universities so please help the staff get through school with generous tips. They do a great job and deserve every dime you leave.\nYou can even spot Mike here most of the time. Look for the physically fit gentleman who never lost his high school physique and has a black patch over his left eye (never asked-he never told)\nLets talk about the dinner rolls. Ok folks this is fine dining in Conway. But the rolls came out of some frozen roll pkg. No, frozen rolls are better. I just don't get it. So don't get your hopes up when the basket of rolls comes.
