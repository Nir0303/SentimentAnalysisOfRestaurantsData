The sales ladies were very friendly and knowledgeable.  They did not pressure you into making a purchase.

The store is one of the last original trading post style stores in Santa Fe and is locally owned. Even though it didn't look like it from outside, The place was huge! It was a whole block long! They have by far the largest Native American jewelry selection in Santa Fe. They were right across from the hotel I was staying at for the weekend (La Fonda) which was convenient for me. I was amazed by the quality, selection and prices of their Zuni and Navajo jewelry. The lady that sells mocassins was quite a character too. I bought a pair of Minnetonka Mocssins and a bracelet from her. She was funny, very helpful and didn't pressure me like some of the salespeople in other stores. This is one of those shops that is a must stop while in Santa Fe. I will definitely be back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-10-17T12:20:30-0400", "location_id": "10404119", "id": "428857446", "user": {"username": "EnchantedTraveler2", "user_location": {"name": "Roswell, New Mexico", "id": "47182"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Good Store", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60958-d10404119-r427735986-m11068-Wind_River_Trading_Co-Santa_Fe_New_Mexico.html#review427735986", "text": "Wind River Trading Co is a comprehensive southwestern store.

But that's not why I stopped at this shop with my Mom last week while visiting Santa Fe. It was the Minnetonka's...so many my head was spinning. They are the most comfortable shoe on the planet and I saw them in the window.  I went inside and then saw they had the old Minnetonka Mocs like I wore in High School...nirvana!!!!!  Then I saw skirts...and beautiful pottery. One of the store clerks said they were having a 50% off sale on clothing, some pottery and jewelry items. We spent 2 hours in there!  I bought several beautiful pieces and the prices were extremely good.  Many of the other shops in SF are very high for comparable works.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-04T10:02:47-0400", "location_id": "10404119", "id": "379694936", "user": {"username": "scotsirishterry", "user_location": {"name": "Highlands Ranch, CO", "id": null}}}]}
