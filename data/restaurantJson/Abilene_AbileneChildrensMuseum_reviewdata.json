My 7 year old was mostly unimpressed, but he liked the magnetic mazes at the front and the giant wooden instrument at the back. My 3 and 5 year olds had a great time. They especially loved the life sized Operation Game and the full sized play ambulance. The climbing tree was a nice touch. That said, they were pretty much done in about 2 hours, so don't plan an entire day around it.
