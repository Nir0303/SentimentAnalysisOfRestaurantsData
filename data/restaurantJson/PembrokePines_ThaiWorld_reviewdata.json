You may have to loosen your belt, though, because the great food is served in generous portions. The restaurant is clean and the staff are attentive and friendly. Even the cook will come to your table to ask how you're enjoying your meal.

The thai donuts were served fresh from the fryer and so hot we had to wait for them to cool off a bit before we could enjoy them.. Well worth the wait.
