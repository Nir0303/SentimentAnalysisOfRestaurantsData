There were husbands and wives, singles and families totaling 19 people.  I checked the breakfast bar before sitting down.  It was small with not many hot items but the fruit bar looked good. I passed on the breakfast bar and ordered from the menu.  I ordered the eggs Benedict with extra hollandaise sauce.    It was very good.  Almost all of us had coffee and it came right away.  Our orders were put in and little by little, they came to the table some much quicker than others.    Everyone had been served except one of our membors and his wife.  They both ordered waffles and sausage but it didn't come with the others. They asked the waitress and she said it will be right up.  More time and she was asked again.  She apologized saying it should be ready soon.  More time, still no food.  The waitress was asked a third time.  Almost everyone was finished with their meal but no waffles or sausage.  Finally, when people were starting to leave, their food was served.  Obviously, their order ticket was lost and absolutely nothing was done to correct the problem.  It was at this time, we learned there was only one cook for a busy Saturday morning.  WHY?  As a my buddy and I were paying for our meal, we were talking about how nice the restaurant was for giving seniors a !0% discount.  My buddy was given the 10%.  My discount was not taken, as I was told, I did not ask for it, even though we were just talking about it right in front of the cashier.   He absolutely refused but since there were many people in line, he finally consented.  I later learned the husband and wife were made to pay full price for their meal, not free nor discounted and no apology.   It should be noted, the waitress did the best she could under these circumstances.  I feel the management needs a customer service realignment.
