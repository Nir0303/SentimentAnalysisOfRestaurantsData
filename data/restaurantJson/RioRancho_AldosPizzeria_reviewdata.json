Calls kept coming in and the front desk person kept deciding to avoid all eye contact or help anyone there and instead answered call after phone call. We waited 20 minutes through this and were forced to leave. I felt bad and wanted to let someone know we were cancelling our order. But I didn't want to call them from home and create more delays for all my fellow line waiters. I tried to go to their website and use their contact us form, but that URL displays as a blank page on my iPad or my laptop in Chrome or Firefox. No way to contact them at all - even face to face.

There is only 1 jar of crushed red pepper in the house, unused on the girls table, I'm given packets for deliveries... The pizza is awful, doughy, undercooked full of unpopped bubbles it was lackluster and disgusting. It was so sad. I loved Venezia!! It was great, ALDOS IS NOT VENEZIA, Needless to say we took a refund and im typing this waiting for a pizza from nypd.\n\nThey announced the business of every nearby delivery, knockouts, yours was expedited quickly, but if you ordered a rectangular pepperoni to be delivered to the el rey theater..... Sorry to say but it sat for 10 min was reheated and brought to you... Dont eat here. Its gross.
