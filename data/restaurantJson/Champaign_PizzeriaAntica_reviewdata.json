Thought pizza would be nice. Disappointed, pizza was soggy, 10 inch. Only one size, $14.  Was not hot. Got cold fast. Bacon pizza had strips of bacon fat not bacon at all. We had Two pizzas for 4 people. Still Hungry when we left. The other pizza we had had Italian sausage, tomatoes, clumps of mozzarella cheese and they said hot olive oil. Thought olive oil meant oil was heated. No, it was spicey hot.

He was right. This is by far the v=best pizza restaurant in the area, and I can say this is one of the best restaurants in Champaign-Urbana.\n\nPizza is made in fire-oven, and the style is Roma I think. Thin crust, and fresh but not heavy (like typical horrible American pizzas) toppings. Of course, if you prefer American (or Chicago) style, this is not for you.\n\nI have a while one with pistachio and I enjoyed a lot. Very crispy, not soggy (as one reviewer wrote) and fresh baked.\n\nThey also offer some appetizers (like cheese plate, ham plate, mix plate, various kinds of salad) We shared a mixed plate and enjoyed as well. Fresh ham and nice selection of cheese.\n\nYou can order beers (bottles) or wine (by the bottle, They did not offer by the glass).\n\nSurprisingly (for Champaign), we needed to wait for maybe 10 minutes. I think they have too few tables considering the size of the place, but probably they'll put more tables as the place gets more popular.\n\nI definitely come back when I go back to Champaign. I wish this place existed when I was there.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-11-11T19:09:14-0500", "location_id": "8381015", "id": "326141451", "user": {"username": "makoto n", "user_location": {"name": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "id": "60795"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "best pizza, best Italian pizza in USA !", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35790-d8381015-r321468280-m11068-Pizzeria_Antica-Champaign_Champaign_Urbana_Illinois.html#review321468280", "text": "the pizza that they serve the same that i ate in Italy, wood fired and the taste i feel myself in italy, basic nice decoration kind people.. best place to eat in USA ", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-10-24T16:17:34-0400", "location_id": "8381015", "id": "321468280", "user": {"username": "serpilik", "user_location": {"name": "Izmir Province, Turkey", "id": "298001"}}}]}
