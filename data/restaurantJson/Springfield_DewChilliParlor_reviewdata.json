Nice selection of hot dogs to accompany a bowl of chilli. On a separate visit I ordered The Torpedo and a vanilla milkshake and it really hit the spot. The Torpedo was a perfect choice for those who can't decide between a chilli with tamale and a hot dog. When you step inside, don't forget to look down!
