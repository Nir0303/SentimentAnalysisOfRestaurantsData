The staff was fantastic and our waitress even made suggestions based on some of our specifications. We ended up ordering everything she suggested and she was dead on. We shared the poutin fries...so so good! The truffle burger...equally delicious and lastly the Brussels sprouts. These were some of the best I have ever had.\n\nThank you state for doing food right and for adding to the experience by having good laid back attitudes :o)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-31T12:20:03-0400", "location_id": "7893335", "id": "360453429", "user": {"username": "Tbirdnorberg", "user_location": {"name": "Redlands, California", "id": "32953"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Fun place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32953-d7893335-r358687930-m11068-The_State-Redlands_California.html#review358687930", "text": "As a local, I have certain places I frequent more often than others. The State is a busy, trendy bar first and foremost, which also serves food. So, if you're up for a hustling and bustling type of atmosphere, this is a good place to go. The service can be kinda slow but I've had good luck with the food. The fish and chips and the BBQ burger are good and the butterscotch dessert was fantastic.
