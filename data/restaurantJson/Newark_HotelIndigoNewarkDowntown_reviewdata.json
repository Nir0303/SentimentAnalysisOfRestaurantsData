The funky, industrial room design works well with the building's original structure, check in was a breeze, and the beds are comfortable.\n\nHowever, since we were tired, we ordered room service. The voice message at room service said to leave a message if no one answered, so we left our room number and order. And then we waited. And waited. Finally, my friend called, only to be told that the kitchen was now closing, so room service wasn't available. He explained that we had followed the voice mail directions more than an hour earlier, and--to their credit--room service came through and delivered our meal rather quickly after that and free of charge. \n\nIf this had been the only snag, I'd be raving about how great this place was, but I came back to the room one day at 3, and the room hadn't been tidied, so I simply called housekeeping for fresh towels and toilet paper that evening. And then, and hour or so later, I called again. Finally, an hour after that, I went down to the front desk to ask, and--of course--just missed housekeeping as they went to my room. \n\nThe next day, I came back at 3, and the housekeeping cart was directly in front of my room. I excused myself, saying I would go down to the bar for a drink, allowing them to tidy the room in peace. I stayed in the bar, drinking an unwanted glass of wine for about 30 minutes. When I returned, the cart was gone, and the room hadn't been cleaned, beds were unmade, towels were still on the floor, and there were no fresh towels. So I gathered the towels, took the elevator into the basement and sought out housekeeping; I didn't want to dump a pile of dirty laundry at the front desk and cause a scene at the hotel, which by now (Saturday) was very busy. I then cleaned the room with lysol wipes, bagged the garbage, and took that to the basement as well.\n\nWhen we checked out on Sunday, the woman on duty at the desk did not ask how our stay was; however, I informed her of the lapses in service. She responded that I should have brought the matter to the attention of the front desk and that I had \"taken the matter to a third party,\" so there was nothing she could do. She spoke very loudly and rudely, dismissing me in front of other customers as if I were some sort of pest.\n\nI am not used to having to clean my own room at a hotel that charges the rates of the Hotel Indigo, and I don't appreciate being spoken to as if I were something unpleasant one might find on one's shoe. Even thinking of this now makes me so upset.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-11-15T00:41:52-0500", "location_id": "4786607", "id": "437340925", "user": {"username": "Ann C", "user_location": {"name": "Watertown, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Great location to everything!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46671-d4786607-r433697907-m11068-Hotel_Indigo_Newark_Downtown-Newark_New_Jersey.html#review433697907", "text": "Parking was available up the block and my room was decent.

At Newark Liberty Airport we called for the shuttle to be told that it does not operate on weekends, so a cold traipse through Newark with cases after getting the NJ Transit to Newark Penn Station. No specific reason for not having a shuttle at weekends given, it was one of the reasons for booking this hotel. Staff on arrival friendly and apologetic, room allocated 807 faced Broad Street, beds comfortable and rooms with nice decor, facilities well appointed and of a good quality including a Keurig coffee maker. Excellent shower too and nice toiletries.\nThe area is indeed sketchy and as we wheeled cases down Broad Street we were asked for money 3/4 times. Didn't feel threatened as there seemed to always be a police presence, just not what we needed after doing our own transfer from the airport in the cold. Maybe the hotel owners need to replicate a guest experience from the airport to fully understand why the no shuttle at weekends is a mistake. And this too could not be used to travel between the hotel and Newark Penn station for trains to New York City. \n\nOn the second day of the two we returned to our room at around midnight to find the door to our room inexplicably open. The room had been \"serviced\" since we left late morning and we reported to reception thankfully nothing appeared to be missing. The receptionist comment that she couldn't do anything having just come on shift. There wasn't in fairness much to \"do\" but we we're surprised by the lack of empathy or recognition of the serious nature of the situation.

My girlfriend and I stayed there one night, that was supposed to be for the drake concert but it was cancelled. Although we were bummed about the show, the hotel made our stay as great as it could be. The staff there are all amazing and go above and beyond what is expected of them. We were allowed to check in early and the room was perfect. The blinds go up and down with a button and the shower was to die for! The bed was really comfortable and everything was clean. We ordered breakfast in the room and it was extremely fast and tasted amazing! When we checked out, the valet drivers were super friendly. Our car battery had died and they went completely out of their way to make sure we were okay. Terell (not sure if the name is correct) stayed with us in the parking lot the whole time and found jumper cables to jump the car.

Housed in a remodeled 1912 bank building, the facility has a great deal of character, while being very comfortable and well-appointed. Smaller hotel, the rooms are fairly small (mine was perhaps 140 square feet, but had floor-to-ceiling windows, and fantastic views).  Staff was very helpful and friendly. Restaurant was well-above average for a hotel restaurant. Workout room in the basement was as expected. Rooftop bar, with great views of the Manhattan skyline, is a great bonus. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but Penn Station is a 5 minute walk. Couple minor quibbles kept it from getting 5 stars (the lights on the bed reading light didn't work, and the TV wasn't properly connected), but these are trivialities.
