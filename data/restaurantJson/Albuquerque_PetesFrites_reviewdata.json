Located in Nob Hill in a small, simply built out store front, you order at a counter, can see the kitchen at the back of the dining space and a runner brings the meal to your table when it's ready.\n\nEverything seemed to work well; I got my order fairly quickly and it was literally hot off the grill.  I had a simple green chile cheese burger (the NM standard measure) and regular fries with aioli.  The burger, a Midwestern grill smashed patty, topped with melted cheddar and NM chile (plus lettuce-tomato-onion) on a specially made potato bun, was exceptional--truly one of the very best I have had in some time; better than the very good one from Santa Fe's Shake Foundation and equal to the Bang Bite food truck burger there.\n\nThe fries, a generous cone full, were soft in the middle and crisp on the outside, hot from the fryer.  Really good overall, will definitely be back when next in town.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-11-15T00:50:39-0500", "location_id": "11620882", "id": "437343576", "user": {"username": "heyU7", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "id": "60958"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "A Pleasant Surprise and Great Burger & Frites", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60933-d11620882-r428914659-m11068-Petes_Frites-Albuquerque_New_Mexico.html#review428914659", "text": "While standing in line at The Guild movie theater, a friend and I noticed Pete's.

The burgers and Frites were delicious and the service and attentive staff were great. We will definitely head back to try other menu items and chill out to the great old skool R&B that was playing in the background.
