I find it interesting that we ordered from the same menu as the evening meal, paid the same price, but did not have a table cloth.   I am sure it is less expensive for them to leave the table cloths off for the lunch bunch.  My companion commented that the meal cooled off very quickly once it was delivered.  We don't really have any suggestions on how to keep it heated.  We have been wanting to visit this restaurant for some time and we will be returning again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-09-30T15:11:00-0400", "location_id": "2706970", "id": "315202962", "user": {"username": "hotrodcadillac", "user_location": {"name": "Hollywood, Florida", "id": "34296"}}}]}
