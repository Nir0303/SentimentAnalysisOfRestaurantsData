We ordered pounds of: brisket, ribs, sausage and roasted chicken.  Our sides included: baked beans, jalape\u00f1o Mac-n-cheese and potato salad.  We heaped the proteins in the center of the dinner table and passed the sides.  Yum and so much fun.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-28T19:38:47-0400", "location_id": "6451579", "id": "398644836", "user": {"username": "Pack D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Hidden Treasure", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56463-d6451579-r398385510-m11068-Lockhart_Smokehouse-Plano_Texas.html#review398385510", "text": "In the quaint \"downtown\" area of Plano, TX, East 15th Street is full of wonderful surprises.  One of them is Lockhart Smokehouse.  My daughter and her husband have been in Plano since 2013, and my husband and I have made several visits.  This was the first time they treated us to that charming area of town.\nWe walked in just after noon on Sunday, and the place was pretty full (but not as bad as other times when our daughter told us that the line to the counter often extends out the front door).  All the meat is sold by the pound with side dishes and drinks on unit prices.  Service is quick as the butcher slices off meat, approximating the weight of your order and folds it up in brown butcher paper (which serves as a plate, too).\nThe ribs were full-flavored and very meaty, the brisket was lean and tasty, the turkey had a little extra zip to it, and the sausage had just the right flavor.  The mac-and-cheese is amazing, and the cole slaw has a unique taste.\nThe four of us, and our 2-year old grandson, ate for $50.15 (based on a scale that the cashier uses to determine your cost) - a GREAT price for the quality and volume.  We had previously eaten at a well-known and highly touted Barbecue place at Legacy (which will go unnamed), but Lockhart was better.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone and plan to return when the opportunity arises.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-28T05:34:36-0400", "location_id": "6451579", "id": "398385510", "user": {"username": "Brenda N", "user_location": {"name": "Shreveport", "id": null}}}]}
