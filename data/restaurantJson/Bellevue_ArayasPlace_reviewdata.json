The ubiquitous tofu tastes as if it had been steamed on it's own and then mixed in with all of the dishes. And it did seem like ALL of the dishes had it. The Phad Thai was overly sweet and utilized too much ketchup, and was rather boring and did not have any of the traditional garnish. The green and red curry's were watery and pretty bland as well. The spring rolls and peanut sauce were good, as was the red/brown rice.\n\nService:\nIt's a buffet, and all of the offerings were routinely replenished and didn't run out of anything. They did take a while to come and remove some dirty plates, but it wasn't horrible.\n\nI deducted a circle from poor to terrible because our work group was a total of 8 people. They couldn't accommodate our group size so we split into two groups, no big deal. The shady thing was they charged us a mandatory gratuity because we had a group larger than 6 but did not tell us. I *might* be okay with this if our tables were in close approximation with each other, but we were literally as far apart from each other as physically possible. I asked to speak with the manager but he was nowhere to be found, so we paid and went on our way. Granted, we would've tipped anyways, but it's the principle involved that irks me. Plus, when a tip is automatically included on a restaurant bill sales taxes are applied to it. \n\nSummary:\nI suppose this would be a good place if one wanted to gorge themselves on mediocre Thai food, but there are MUCH better alternatives nearby which are also friendly to us omnivores.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2013-05-03T14:24:44-0400", "location_id": "3626287", "id": "159574173", "user": {"username": "Aaron K", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "Very good vegiterian Thai Food...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58349-d3626287-r159184557-m11068-Araya_s_Place-Bellevue_Washington.html#review159184557", "text": "I visited this place with friends and family and as we have some vegiterians this was the place for them.
