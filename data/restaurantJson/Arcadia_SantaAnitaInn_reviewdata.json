It is also close to the freeway and a Westfield mall, with a plethora of dining options (from Chipotle and Hot Dog on a Stick to Benihans and Cheesecake Factory), and with the largest Forever 21 my daughter had ever seen.\n\nIn general, this was a budget place, but it had more character than the average budget option.  The grounds were nicer than most budget motels, with a waterfall which could be viewed from the pool, grassy areas, a gazebo, and even a little manicured garden.  Strangely, the \"jacuzzi\" was intentionally cold water. The complimentary breakfast was pretty comprehensive, with cereal, milk, oatmeal (instant, with hot water and a microwave), OJ, toast (yourself) and jam, fresh fruit (cantaloupe and honeydew melon), coffee, tea (with hot water), cocoa mix, etc. in a breakfast room off the lobby. The staff was super friendly and hardworking (particularly the woman working the breakfast area and the housekeeper).  And the room itself very spacious, with high ceilings.\nThat said, there was definitely room for improvement. Safety and security were an issue.  The upstairs balconies are shared with the room next door, so your neighbors can walk out their sliding glass door and peer into your room because the shutters and curtains do not completely block the view.  The room door didn't have a security latch to lock the door from the inside.  In looking for somewhere to plug in my phone, I discovered that one electrical outlet had one of those ancient, cheap multi-plugs with the TV, dorm 'fridge and two lamps all sharing one outlet (looked like a fire hazard waiting to happen). There is a lip between the outdoor hallway and the room, which I tripped over numerous times, and stairs to the parking lot didn't have handrails. The was definitely some deferred maintenance.  The dorm 'fridge in the room had one foot missing, so you had to brace it to open it (or it started to fall out of the cabinet when you pulled the door).  The room itself looked spotless, but the carpet was so dirty that our socks became black while walking across it.  One of the ice machines was broken.\nIt is also important for light sleepers (like me) to know that it's noisy, there really isn't an option for a quiet room.  This property is surrounded on three sides by busy streets, with a hospital located on one of them.  So in addition to traffic noise, there was a steady stream of emergency vehicles with sirens blaring all day and all night.  In addition, there is a building that houses some system that vented to the parking lot and created quite a loud blowing noise. Because the windows in the bathroom were louvered, they didn't block outside noise well.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-30T16:01:31-0400", "location_id": "86375", "id": "315210220", "user": {"username": "TravelTs", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Nice grounds- lousy Hotel.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29105-d86375-r300975842-m11068-Santa_Anita_Inn-Arcadia_California.html#review300975842", "text": "A while ago I pass by this Hotel and the grounds looks so pretty that I wanted to stay here and finally I did.....
