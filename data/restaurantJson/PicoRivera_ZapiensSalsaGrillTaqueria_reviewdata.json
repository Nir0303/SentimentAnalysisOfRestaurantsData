Especially the hand made tortillas when available. I work for a large corporation close by so will bring clients and co workers here. But one evening unfortunately soured all the previous good experiences. Many of my friends and co workers had just left a funeral service for a dear friends mother passing. We had all decided to come to Salsa Grill to have dinner. I had checked their hours earlier and saw they close at 8pm on a Sunday which i thought was unusual so we made it a point to get there before closing. There were about 12 of us and we all drove into parking lot around 730 I saw all the employees sweeping floors so decided to enter and say I had large group. Their sign still indicated open but young women who I guessed was night manager told us they were closed now. I asked politely weren't they open to 8pm and she said yes but this night they were closed. I said I had fellow workers and friends driving up and would be a large receipts. She looked around workers and said let me call owner. She returned and said sorry they turned off everything in kitchen and cook left. I explained these people are regular customers of yours from a large corporation that does visits quite often. She left again to inquire with someone then again said sorry there closed. It was not 8 pm closing time. I told her if she closes early on Sunday evening they should just post on door or put on website that they are subject to early close. So good food or not this place lost some very good loyal clients. The way the economy is these days you would think a business would curry good will instead of turning away loyal customers. So went across street to Chilis and had a decent meal for 15 people and the waiter was very good and we had such good time the place put no pressure on us even though we stayed past their closing time. The waiters were tipped nicely and the manager was kind and had no issue at all that we passed their closing time. That is customer service people.

There are great combination plates with the traditional items: tacos, carnitas and burritos.  Zapien's is one of the few places that offers mole, chicharones, flautas, taquitos and enchiladas suizas.  Everything is very flavorful and combo plates come with beans and rice, but with true homemade flavor.   The enchiladas suizas are really great although they are made with flour tortillas, not the traditional corn tortillas.  The flautas, chicken or beef, are also made with flour tortillas which really allows you to appreciate the meat filling.  Weekday mornings have super $5 specials and there is quite a variety.   They are now offering a brunch menu and they have freshly made tortillas.  The service is always friendly and attentive.  Prices are reasonable and portions are generous.   You are greeted with lightly seasoned tortilla chips (can't figure out their secret seasoning spice!), salsa and, if you are lucky- killer bean dip!   The interior is two rooms with tables or wooden bench booths.  The walls are decorated with art prints and awards.
