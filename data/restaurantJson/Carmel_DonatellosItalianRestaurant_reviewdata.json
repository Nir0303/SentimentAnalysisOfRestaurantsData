The dressing was flavorful but the salad needed just a little more of it.  \n\nMy husband selected the Beef Rossini for his entr\u00e9e.  He enjoyed it but thought the filet was a little too done for the temperature he ordered and the sauce wasn't as flavorful as the last time he enjoyed it.  I had the wild mushroom risotto.

It was great to see it as a choice on Donatello's menu and I highly recommend it.\n\nNot ones to shy away from dessert, coffee and after-dinner drinks we ordered all of them!  The coffee was lukewarm but had good flavor. The chocolate chip cannoli was very flavorful.  After dinner liquors were as expected and decent pours.  \n\nThe servers were attentive and friendly.  We think they should lose the white aprons and just wear black shirt and black pants.  Why?  One of the servers had a stain on her apron.
