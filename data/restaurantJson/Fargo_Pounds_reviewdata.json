We got the app combo with, what I should point out now, are actually lobster egg rolls , well-made chicken strips from scratch and pretzel bites. Totally different than a lobster roll, still very good. The pretzel bites were good, with ample beer cheese soup for dipping. The burgers choices were greatly varied. All 3 burgers (nooge, orange windmill, and the dr pepper bbq sauce one) were cooked perfectly. There's an option to skip the bun and get a bed of lettuce. They come with fries, which we paid an extra buck to have parmesan cheese and truffle oil added to. The fries were a bit soggy,  presumably from the added oil, but tasty. I had a local sour beer, fabulous. The hubs had the Ugly Sweater, and says he'd drink it again, ha. Service was spot on. We were 1 of 3 tables during service.

The outside was done perfectly and not greasy at all, and like I said, the filling was tasty, but more than once I had hot grease squirt out as I bit into it. Not a pretty sight. \nI ordered a burger, and went with the waiters suggestion of the Orange Windmill. I was not a fan. I love all of the ingredients, but this burger, not so much. Others have rivaled them against other local burger places. Not. Even. Close. \nAnd that's pretty much how dinner went. There was an order of poutine, some knoephla soup, and sweet potato fries another burger and two chicken sandwiches. And not one of us ever raved. About any of it. \nNow let's talk about service. Our friends were waiting for us when we got there and almost immediately after we joined them the waiter came over and interrupted our hellos to ask if he could get a drink order. I don't think the menu was even in my hands yet. So, please come back. Which he did, several times. It bordered on pushy. But once we got our order in he was hard to track down. They repeatedly brought food and drink items to the table without clearing the dishes from the previous round. It was messy and annoying. Fries were served with wrong sandwiches. That kind of stuff. \nThe first round of drinks were actually very good. Smokey bloody Mary (ordered it spicy, but not sure it was) and beers everyone enjoyed. After the meal I ordered a caramel apple martini, which was not good. Plus, the waiter spilled some on the table so it was a sticky mess. \nI REALLY wanted to like this place, but downtown has a lot better offerings.
