I attended the September one and had a great time.  They give you a map of the art on display in the city and they also offered a free guided tour, which we took advantage of.  Many people turned it into a kind of art walk/bar crawl as you walk around to see the art.  The picture attached is of the map they gave us.  I suppose if you are not there on a day when they are doing this, you can at least visit the art and/or galleries that are listed on the map!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-07T07:47:30-0500", "location_id": "1880514", "id": "248080426", "user": {"username": "Visa711", "user_location": {"name": "Toledo, Ohio", "id": "51048"}}}]}
