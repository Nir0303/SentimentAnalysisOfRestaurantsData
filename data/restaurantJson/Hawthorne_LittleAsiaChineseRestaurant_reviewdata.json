Small tables for 2 line one wall, booths line the other and larger tables in the middle.  Small place.  We were told where to sit and a waiter brought us tea cups and tea right away.  Lunch prices were very reasonable.  $5.50 lunch special included a \"salad\", wonton, soup and entr\u00e9e.  \"Salad\" was bits of lettuce on a dessert sized plate.  A fairly good sized wonton was sitting on top.  Soup was served in very small bowl, some kind of egg type soup.  It had good flavor but then also had a slimy consistency and I wasn't sure if it had raw egg mixed in.  Probably not, but that's how it felt and I couldn't get over that.  Wonton was good, and then the \"Salad\" actually surprised me because they  had poured a clear lemony dressing over it and that was tasty.  Just not really a salad versus shredded lettuce.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken with steamed rice.  Food was brought out fairly quickly.  Large portions of meat.  But once I started eating it, the ratio of meat to rice that was given was off.  Too much meat, not enough rice.  No veggies in the dish, just chili peppers.  So after a while, it was overwhelming.  Good flavor and spicy, made my nose run.  Then we were brought the check and given a fortune cookie each.  Servers were fast, efficient, but not very engaging.  Not unfriendly, but not friendly either.  Sort of in the middle if that makes sense.  The other thing of note was that a lot of cops frequent this place.  There were 4 or 5 of them eating while we were there and you could hear them \"talking shop\".  All in all, not sure I would go back.  It was a good price for a decent meal, but not much atmosphere.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-09-30T10:14:48-0400", "location_id": "4653584", "id": "179227777", "user": {"username": "Helena C", "user_location": {"name": "Hawthorne, California", "id": "32478"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32478-d4653584-r120216381-m11068-Little_Asia_Chinese_Restaurant-Hawthorne_California.html#review120216381", "text": "Not the best looking spot, yet the food is good.
