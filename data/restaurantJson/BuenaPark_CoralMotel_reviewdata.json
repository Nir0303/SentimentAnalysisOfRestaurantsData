The Coral Motel is older quaint motel the walls are sound proof my room was large had a small refrigerator and tile floor, which was great for my shedding Belgain Shepard.\n\nHotels start at about $70 and go up quick, weekends at the Coral Motel $50 a day.\n\nThe Coral is a friendly family run business, unfortunately I speak only english and there is a language barrier and communication takes time,\n\nI dont know if there is a pool, there is laundry room and no problem getting on the free internet (you dont get that at motel 6).
