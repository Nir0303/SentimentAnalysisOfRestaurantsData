The food is made fresh, to your order, served piping hot and always with a smile.  This is a budget friendly gem for lunch or early dinner.  They close at six.  Also have take out and catering service.  El Nopal serves beer and wine, many Mexican specialty sodas and the usual USA brands, as well as hot or iced tea or coffee.\n\nJose is always ready to customize your order.  I particularly like a small burrito with the works:  sour cream, guacamole and hot peppers.  It's the Super Burrito in mini version.  Give El Nopal a try you're in downtown Vallejo or environs.
