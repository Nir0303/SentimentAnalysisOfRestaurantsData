Had not tried LaFavorita in elk grove yet. Hubby and I were out shopping and when we drove past LaFavorita, we made a quick u turn and here is where we had lunch. I had the nachos with carnitas. Just so so. Carnitas didn't stack up to other caritas that I like. Guacamole was out of a bag, ick. Not good flavor. Hubby had 2 carnitas enchiladas, rice and beans. Sauce on enchiladas was really red. And beans and rice just eh. Just not much favor compared to other Mexican restaurants we really love. Probably won't be rushing back.

Thank you!  I had a stop for lunch that was recommended as great food and this place sure lived up to that! I had the Taco Salad (trying to go light) and it was very good. The burritos, tacos and plate items looked awesome as well.  People were all busy eating - hum wonder why.  The parking is in the back and very tight, but it has a great outdoor seating and the food comes really fast to your table. I loved the iPad at the register to pay.  Staff was very kind and helpful.
