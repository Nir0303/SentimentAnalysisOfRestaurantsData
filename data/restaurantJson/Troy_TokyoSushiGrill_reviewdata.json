The tuna roll was warm and so was the California roll. The tuna was gummy. And the wasabi was mushy. I was totally disappointed in the quality and surprised because it used to be good. Unfortunately I will not be returning here again. The customer service was good. If I had dined in, I definitely would've sent back my food, but it was a to-go order. \n\nThe place is small and simple. Definitely not romantic or fancy.
