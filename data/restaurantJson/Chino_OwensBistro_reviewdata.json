Owen's is in the quint downtown area of Chino and is in the building of a former bank built at the turn of the 20th century.  It was a warm summer night and we were out on the patio where a nice breeze kept us comfortable. \n\n From the moment we entered the restaurant we had excellent service and friendly, attentive interaction with the staff.  Denise, one of the owners, greeted us when we arrived and took our orders promptly since she knew that we were going to the theatre.  The menu was explained with care and the staff was happy for us to share dishes.  \n\nI have to say that the crispy fried Brussel sprouts were an outstanding appetizer.  They came with a lemon aioli sauce and Parmigiana Reggiano.  Most of us ordered the Angus rib eye steak although I had the beef filet. a; was cooked to perfection. Both dishes were served with  arugula, radish, turnip, potato and chiles.  The garnish/accompaniement looked nice but it was rather tasteless.  I am not certain but I think that the white balsamic vinegar might have been forgotten.\n\nThe New Zealand Venison looked delicious and the wild boar with octopus was enjoyed by my partner.  \n\nWe enjoyed meeting James the chef/owner when he came out to see how we were getting along with dinner.  All the servers were good at their jobs and very personable.

Garlic cheese bread was simply bread with cheese and garlic but was very tasty. Brussels sprouts were to die for, I asked for the recipe but she said it was a secret\n\n- Fillet mignon medallions and barbecue short ribs. Both were amazing, both meats were very tender and seasoned and cooked perfectly. \n\nWe shared the warm soft chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert. When making the reservation we told them it was our anniversary, they had little decorations on the table when we arrived and served us a small bottle of split champagne during dessert. It was a nice touch.\n\nService was a tad bit slow, took about 2.5 hours for the whole experience. That was okay with us as we wanted to just sit and relax. They served wine and beer only, no mixed drinks. \n\nEveryone working there was extremely kind, courteous and professional. We would definitely return keeping in mind that it will be a long night. There was plenty more to try on the menu that we didn't have. \n\nThere is a nice gentleman that plays guitar on the patio during dinner, if you want a quieter experience ask to be sat inside or away from him.

I had to inquire about meal. Seemed excess waiters bumping into each other but not really serving customers. Waiters seemed disengaged.  The food was excellent. Over priced for skimpy portions. Husband made a sandwich when he got home. Over priced for skimpy portions. This was our first visit. \nThank you with hopes of improvement.
