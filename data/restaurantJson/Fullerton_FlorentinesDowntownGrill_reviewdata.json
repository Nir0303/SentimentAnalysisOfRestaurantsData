There are plenty of options to choose from.  One reason why we chose Florentine's is because they have their menu posted.  There is a front and rear entrance to Florentine's with a rear connection to the Tuscany Club and a front connection to Palapa Grill, both sister restaurants.  The staff took time to warm up but our server, Syerra, was great.  Florentine's has a full bar, some booths, high tables and normal height tables.  The normal height tables are on an elevated platform from the rest of the establishment.  Plenty of wood decor so it can be a bit dark inside with not a lot of natural exterior light coming in.  There are several flat screens present so I can see this place being busy during local college and pro games.  Being there for a Sunday dinner we noticed that a decent number of the patrons appeared to be regulars, some couples, some families.  The dishes we ordered were the Fried Calamari which was tender but appearance was bland; there was no fried color, the batter was cooked (as was the calamari) but the color remained relatively white.  The calamari consisted of thin rings and some tentacles.  Standard would to have a better fried color and to make this dish stand out more Florentine's needs to vary the length of the rings.  Our son could not pass up the Glazed Doughnut Cheeseburger.  We had heard of this combo before but never encountered it so this was an entree that our son could not pass up.  To be honest the doughnut cannot replace a typical hamburger or brioche bun as the doughnut squishes easily and falls apart way too fast.  However the juxtaposition of the normal hamburger ingredients and the sweetness and texture of the glazed doughnut was interesting in a positive way.  The hamburger was tasty and juicy and didn't fall apart as the bottom half of the doughnut did.  Several side options are included with the burger and onion rings were chosen.  These were large and nicely golden crisp unlike the fried calamari.  So the onion rings were good.  The Braised Short Rib was a large block of tender tasty boneless moo with the right balance of fat.  A good-sized serving of coarse mashed potatoes and a skewer with plenty of veggies was included.  Interesting was the side of salad we ordered and called $2 Side Salad but it costs $2.49!  We felt very relaxed at Florentine's and glad we gave them a try.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-12T16:37:54-0400", "location_id": "818738", "id": "404708594", "user": {"username": "flashncrash", "user_location": {"name": "Berkeley, California", "id": "32066"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Best margarita rocks in town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32416-d818738-r365842445-m11068-Florentine_s_Downtown_Grill-Fullerton_California.html#review365842445", "text": "I love this place.

My wife had the John Dory fish in a delicious sauce with mashed potatoes and vegetables paired with a white wine. Now, I'm not a fish person, but this could have possibly changed my mind if it wasn't for the ribeye steak I enjoyed.

The salad for a buck fifty more was very good size and tasty..green leaf lettuce too. Father in law who is a really picky eater said the chicken pesto was really good.
