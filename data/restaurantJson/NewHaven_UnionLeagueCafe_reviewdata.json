Parking same as theater district is validated. The ambiance felt like a NYC equivalent restaurant with close, lined single tables. (Not super romantic or private but the food outweighs all and makes everyone else disappear!). The feel is Old charm with lower ceilings, narrow aisle, and antique furnishings blended with modern art.  Interestingly dish serving-ware and the cocktail serving-ware was plain -  plastic stirrers, fake table candle, plain white plates, and no copper cup for the mule.  Service was excellent with multiple attendees and great balance of attention and pleasant efficiency. \nThe meal was fabulous - my husband loved the octopus appetizer cooked perfect (but portion-wise would have loved 1 more leg) and my steak app was tasty. Cheese sampler was ok. We asked to be surprised and try new cheeses we may have not experienced. What was brought was not impressive for a French Restaurant - just similar to cheddar and Brie. No wow factor. My main meal changed that tho. The red pepper crusted lamb with veggies was fabulous. Unique flavor and prep is indescribable. Just what you want in trying something new. My husband had the yellow fin tuna. He gave it a thumbs up along with the lava cake and ending espresso.  I had an Argentinian coffee at the end which again was unique and memorable. Paired with Feuillantine Au Chocolat Et Noisettes, a blend of my fave sweet desserts: chocolate, hazelnut, and caramel. Summary: Service 5.  Food 5. Ambiance 4.
