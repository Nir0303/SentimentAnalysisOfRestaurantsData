I have dined here several times and never been disappointed.  Everything on the menu is fresh made each day down to the homemade breads including choices such as sourdough, wheat & white. I especially like Fridays when Chicken Poulet is featured. The sides are always difficult decisions for me to make as I like all of them. I guess I must say my favorite is Cornbread Salad, but Strawberry Pretzel salad and Grape Salad run a close second! I feel like I am eating more healthy when I dine here.  The atmosphere is so pleasant with local artist work displayed on the walls and a book nook offered for reading relaxation. I do want to point out also that the servers are all so kind and caring. I will continue to be a loyal customer.

Well, to simply put it, it is the most inviting and relaxing restaurant in Decatur, Alabama. You walk in, and you see two walls covered in hand painted artwork made by various people in the town. How cool is that? You can tell that the  owner is very passionate about the business because she is always working hard trying to accommodate every customer with any desire they want! You have to try the Poulet when you go! Because it is so good, it sells out quickly so you might want to go early! Also, the various sandwiches they have every day with handmade bread definitely sets it apart from the rest! You also have to try the handmade fruit tea and desserts!!!! Good thing distance limits me to where I cannot go all of the time because I would surely gain too many unwanted pounds. Strawberry pretzel, rocky road brownies, and the white chocolate cookies are just a few of my favorites!!! Can you tell that this is one of my favorite restaurants?? The only thing left I could say is that you must go and try it for yourself. They will make sure you are very well taken care of, and once you take the first bite of your sandwich, Poulet, or chicken salad you'll definitely realize why I rave so much about this place! So if you're anywhere near the Decatur area, I would definitely recommend stopping by Let's Do Lunch and getting a one of a kind experience! Thanks so much Let's Do Lunch for being so welcoming and family friendly! It is surely appreciated!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "decatur2015, Owner at Let&#39;s Do Lunch, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for taking time to post a review of Let's Do Lunch!
