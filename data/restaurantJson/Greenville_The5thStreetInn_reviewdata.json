Chris, innkeeper and owner, was a terrific host and very accommodating of our late arrival and need to leave our car parked there for most of the next day (even after we had checked out).  It felt more like staying with a family friend than a business.  Breakfast was top-notch, and the rooms were charming, in good condition, and very clean.  The complementary WiFi was robust and reliable.   It's also a GREAT VALUE: Since it seems that PRICE info is not directly reported by these owners, I'll go ahead and \"reveal\" that we paid:  We got \"the Chancellor Suite\" [top floor, HUGE, with a large sitting area and two TVs] for $129/night PLUS another room (on 2nd floor) which cost only $50/nt because we had booked more than one room.   In other words, if your traveling party needs more than one room, 5th St. offers a BIG discount on the 2nd (and 3rd ..4th, etc).. ]   So, bottom-line:  1st-Class, convenient accommodations with thoughtful and considerate management for just under $200 (2 rooms)-- that is VERY tough to beat.
