edificio sembra un palazzetto basso affossato tra i grandi e alti grattacieli di Chicago, poi sta pure poco distante dalla Willis Tower (ex Sears Tower) che svetta a quasi mezzo chilometro di altezza. In realt\u00e0 questo palazzo \u00e8 stato costruito nell'Ottocento, interamente in mattoni e con pareti spesse circa un metro e mezzo. Conta solo sedici piani, ma per quel tempo era praticamente un record. In pratica con la costruzione di questo edificio si \u00e8 dato inizio alla storia dei grattacieli. Va quindi visto a mio parere anche con un po' di fantasia e cercando di immaginare cosa fosse Chicago in quegli anni.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-10-22T13:03:45-0400", "location_id": "107445", "id": "182001141", "user": {"username": "odisseo71", "user_location": {"name": "Rome, Italy", "id": "187791"}}}]}
