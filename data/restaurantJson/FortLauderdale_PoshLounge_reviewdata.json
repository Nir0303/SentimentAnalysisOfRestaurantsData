I'll comment on each aspect of this place so reviewers can judge for themselves.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Very chilled and relaxed. The crowd can be younger business people to out of town tourist looking for a relaxing/chill spot to even older folks. On the weekends when the DJ spins, it really gets the crowd going but not in the clubby annoying way. You don't have to scream over the music to hear your friends speak. I have even been there when folks hosts their birthdays or celebration which tells me people love that true LOUNGE atmosphere. \n\nSERVICE: The service is very personable, from the server to the chef who even greeted us and asked if we needed anything else. When the Owners are there, they are very attentive, friendly and makes patrons feel like family.  \n\nFOOD: Other than their hookahs (which I'll review next),THE BEST PART of going to Posh is the amazing sushi. Being a die hard sushi lover, I have had EVERYTHING on their menu. Their signature flaming roll is out of this world and I guarantee you would not find this anywhere. My other favorite rolls are the 4 Seasons & Big Daddy. For the light eaters, I would recommend the sun roll and JJ Roll.  There would be times I don't feel like being out, I would just call them up (  954 763-3553  ), place my order and they would have it ready. Hardy, the chef, is top notch and have my vote for THE best sushi chef ever!\n\nHOOKAH: Where else can you go and enjoy sushi and hookah at the same time?!!. Avid Hookah smokers can tell you there are certain things you look for: The tobacco used in Posh's hookahs not only taste amazing, they have a great variety of flavors, produce huge cloud smokes and it lasts over 2 hours which in other places, I've only gotten 45 mins of good smoking in before I have to pay for another. \n\nNo matter where I travel in the world, when I come back home to Fort Lauderdale, I have to get my sushi fix!. I would recommend Posh to anyone :-)", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-02T11:31:38-0400", "location_id": "3931844", "id": "213331975", "user": {"username": "Vandana1129", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "id": "34227"}}}]}
