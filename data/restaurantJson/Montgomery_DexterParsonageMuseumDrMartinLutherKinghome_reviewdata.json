I am unfamiliar with others who conduct the tours, they may be just as inspirational.

The staff at the museum were all lovely and very welcoming, our guide Victory was an absolute joy who was so knowledgeable and passionate.  Victory explained everything in depth and really went out of her way to tell us about the area in general.  If you are in Montgomery you must visit the museum, highly recommended.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-17T14:41:01-0400", "location_id": "291939", "id": "419601542", "user": {"username": "Chris G", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
