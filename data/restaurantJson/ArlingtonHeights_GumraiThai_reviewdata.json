The first night, we wanted some more exotic food - Thai, Malaysian, Japanese, Indian, Moroccan, Afghani.  We were headed to another Thai place, but passed it accidentally when we saw Gumrai and that they had parking next to the restaurant.  That was the deciding factor.\n\nAlthough we initially concerned that the sign at the counter said \"No sushi\", the waiter assured us that they had some that day and we could order it.  The more conventional members of the group got traditional Chinese food, the more adventurous got green curry.  Most of us indulged in our sushi fetish, and were amply rewarded.\n\nThe food was tasty, hot, and well prepared.  The appetizers followed conventional treatments, but were clearly made fresh.  The fish was outstanding and sweet as candy.  Even the green curry, eaten by a connoisseur, went down very well.  Everyone was happy with the meal, and the prices were not extreme.\n\nThe only criticism we have - the restaurant was hot.  We sweated in our seats despite the weather being mild outside.\n\nBut with food this good, I can ignore that.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-23T18:11:14-0400", "location_id": "1007967", "id": "396016747", "user": {"username": "Lynn E", "user_location": {"name": "Iowa City, Iowa", "id": "38020"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Thai food like homemade.
