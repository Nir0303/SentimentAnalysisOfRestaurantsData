The service is average to good--friendly folks. It isn't the ritz...\nHowever, I come for the food. You cannot get food like this, except perhaps at the Long Branch in Granby Colorado. ( More Austrian food)  From the red cabbage, the breads, the spaetzel, the Saur-Bratten, the Pork dishes, der schnitzels, the sauces, the potatoes, das Bierren, and finally the deserts--that is why I come to Gerda's. Between the Bohemia Cafe and Gerda's, when I come to Omaha,  I stoke my German ancestry, and my love for \" Excellent Peasant Food\".", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-10T16:42:57-0400", "location_id": "3316619", "id": "287754030", "user": {"username": "Robert W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Good food but bad customer service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60885-d3316619-r274280413-m11068-Gerda_s_German_Restaurant_and_Bakery-Omaha_Nebraska.html#review274280413", "text": "My husband and I were visiting Omaha for the weekend and decided to visit Gerdas for some authentic German food.

The decor really sets the tone as a slice of Bavaria right here in America.\n\nGood Sauerbraten (German pot roast) is nearly impossible to find, but Gerda's does not disappoint.  They served me the best Sauerbraten I have had in 25 years!  The Schweinbraten (pork instead of beef) has a different sauce that better complements pork, and it is also outstanding.\n\nGerda's signature dish is Jaeger Schnitzel (pork in a burgundy mushroom sauce), and includes a glass of beer or wine and a slice of Black Forest Cherry Torte for dessert.  Everyone in my group who had the Jaeger Schnitzel raved about it.\n\nGerda's is a fun family restaurant with truly authentic German food that is delicious, well presented, and reasonably priced.
