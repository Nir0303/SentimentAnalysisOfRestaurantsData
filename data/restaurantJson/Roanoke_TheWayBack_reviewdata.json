The kids were participating in a Lego Build and got hungry and we found some great pizza.  Ken (the owner) was absolutely wonderful he made sure we were taken care of and joked around with the kids.  The pizza tasted fantastic (brick oven). I highly suggest anyone come check out their full menu (they don't normally have a buffet).  We will definitely be back on a date night soon!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-09T08:40:03-0400", "location_id": "8726646", "id": "362803336", "user": {"username": "Leslie H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
