Hotel is very clean, rooms are large, and staff is friendly. Added bonus is the hotel is locked later in the evening so it's safe too. \n\nOnly thing that needs a little improving is the breakfast. The food tasted good but we had to re-heat it all up ourselves and the choices were limited. The hotel also doesn't having vending.\n\nWould stay again!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-02T07:56:04-0400", "location_id": "1235576", "id": "388445470", "user": {"username": "Fran J", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Unique Hotel", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60365-d1235576-r387270411-m11068-The_Clarke_Hotel-Waukesha_Wisconsin.html#review387270411", "text": "No chain type hotel here.Very nice,everything from this 20 room hotel is unique,from the continental breakfast in the irish pub with individual quiches to the room set up.The rooms have really comfortable king size beds with high quality bedding and lots of pillows,best sleep ever for all of us we had 2 rooms.1 room had 2 bedrooms each with a king bed nightstands and lamps and a tv and closet.Room had a large dressser,coffemaker and mini fridge and a large bathroom with a huge kohler body jet shower that is awesome.The 2nd room was for 6 people with 1 bedroom with 2 king beds same great beds and bedding with a living room with pullout couch and 2 chairs with tv in bedroom and iving room,same large dresser and coffeemaker and fridge and shower.There is a commons area on 2nd floor with couches,microwave and icemaker and elevator is very unique.The downtown area is very cool lots of  bars and restaurants with free music and original type shops and a farmers market on satuday morning that is very nice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-28T19:49:31-0400", "location_id": "1235576", "id": "387270411", "user": {"username": "christineinwisconsin", "user_location": {"name": "Brillion, Wisconsin", "id": "59729"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Downtown Waukesha gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60365-d1235576-r386624030-m11068-The_Clarke_Hotel-Waukesha_Wisconsin.html#review386624030", "text": "The quaint hotel is located right in downtown along side the bars, restaurants and fun.

It's the little things that will give you a bad review.  1st was all the construction around the hotel..messy, and a pain for parking. The room was large, but very boring! Really could use some art work on all those big brown walls. There was no clock in the room (we do not have smart phones attached to our faces 24/7. We were 2 people...there was only one washcloth..1 bar of soap (so now you have to keep transferring it from the shower to the sink..nice Keurig coffee machine..however only 1 pod of coffee..with no stir sticks to stir the coffee! So I look for a paper and pen to write all this down, and you guessed it..none in the room!  Wrote it all down with stuff from my purse and gave it to the manager in the morning..who assured me it would all be taken care of...oops..almost for forgot the burned out light bulb (the one between the 2 chairs where you would read. Went shopping for the afrernoon..came back, and not one thing was changed!! We got a bartender to find us a light bulb...he said they're switching over to LED ones next week. OK..enough..just know we were very disappointed, and probably won't return.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-25T19:43:52-0400", "location_id": "1235576", "id": "358603323", "user": {"username": "Sue K", "user_location": {"name": "Oshkosh, Wisconsin", "id": "60168"}}}]}
