She finally got up to do her job when a server looked lost trying to figure where to seat me. They dumped the iced tea right before I tried to order one. I order the first round of food then they tell me the kitchen is closing at 9:20. So instead of ordering food and pissing off the kitchen, getting poor quality food, we left and still had to pay. They had already locked the doors, turned off the lights and broken down the sushi bar. The time I dined here before this, I sat at a table for 10 minutes until someone finally came up to greet me and my hibachi food was never delivered to the table.

Nice looking place. We got seated fast but then it was after lunch crush. Sat down and looked at the menu. We decided on the buffet - all you can eat BUT.. they charge you for any food left on your plate! Say what? When I tried to get the waitress to be more specific as to how much can be left with out getting charged - she could not answer. 5 grains of rice, 10? No answer. Everything seems to be as they see it. Due to dietary restrictions there are certain foods I can only eat a small amount of and they bring it out in standard size portions. She said she could not bring just a sampling. I was so angry, I got up and left the table to sit in the lobby and wait for the rest of the family to finish. I had asked for the manager and when she finally presented herself I was really ready to leave. She even had a male server stand with her as she spoke with me. Yeah like this old lady was gonna pop her. Now that is just insulting. I ended up eating two very tiny spring rolls and drinking water just to keep my family happy.  I have NEVER been to an all you can eat buffet that charges you for what is left on your plate or only serves you their size portions and I will never return to this place again. If you go be prepared to lick your plate or you may get charged. By the way the kids said the food was good.
