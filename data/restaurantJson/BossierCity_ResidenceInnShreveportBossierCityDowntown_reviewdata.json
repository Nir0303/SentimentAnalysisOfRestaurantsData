One of the things that we did not like about it was the fact that there was no coffee table in front of the couch.  We thought that was very odd.  There was however a very nice table with chairs but nothing either on the side of the couch or in front.  \n\nThe bed in our room was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in and lounged late every morning that we stayed there.  It was wonderful!  I would go back to this hotel just for the bed.\n\nSince there was no bathtub I would have second thoughts about staying there.  The view from our hotel room was a parking lot of the very large hotel next door so we tended to keep our curtains closed for privacy sake.\n\nOur room was quiet after a certain hour and we actually thought that since we were next door to such a large hotel that it would be very noisy but it was blessedly very peaceful.  \n\nThe room had a very modern feel and was very clean and their staff was wonderful!

At that time, I had a baby that was an infant (February 2016) and the front desk manager helped me and the baby to our room. He went over and above. I knew at that point this was going to be my \"always\" hotel in Shreveport area even though I had been faithfully staying at another boutique hotel. Recently, I stayed once again, and as usual everything was wonderful. Theo, one of the staff members, helped me with directions and we had a nice chat about Louisiana and what a good place it can be to raise a family. He really took the time to care about me as a customer and went over and above to make my day. I was able to work out in the cleanest gym I've ever experienced. Missed swimming, but want to try that some time too, as the hotel lends itself to R & R. A couple of critiques I might add - I love the suite rooms, but wish they weren't SOOO far down the hallway! And also, while the breakfast is just very nice, with clean area and well put together, it seems that the eggs are just not that great.  Would it be possible to crack some eggs in a skillet, rather than use the factory stuff? Not sure, but for we gluten-free protein eaters....this ranks pretty high.  Nevertheless, I will be back again and again. The staff is over and above fantastic.
