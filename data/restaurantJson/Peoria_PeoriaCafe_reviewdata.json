The place was busy, but we were immediately greeted and seated within 5 minutes. The waitress (tall attractive blonde) immediately came to our table and was friendly and had water and coffee to us within moments of being seated. I ask several questions about the daily specials and then inquired about the Mexican style breakfast on the menu. This gal really knew the products and based upon her recommendations I had a bowl of Menudo soup and my wife had Huevos Rancheros. The wait on the food was less than 10 minutes and the presentation was really attractive. WoW! the food was delicious. We are natives to Arizona and have eaten Mexican Breakfast all our lives and this was really good food. Now I understand why this is such a busy restaurant. Upon completion of our meal our waitress recommend we come back on Friday night for their fish fry and I think that will be put on our To Do List. I enjoyed the meal so much that I left a 30% tip for our waitress. I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to a return visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-09-21T14:29:01-0400", "location_id": "514065", "id": "312500412", "user": {"username": "hgrman", "user_location": {"name": "Sun City, AZ", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Old fashioned home cooking", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31308-d514065-r309647099-m11068-Peoria_Cafe-Peoria_Arizona.html#review309647099", "text": "great home cooking type of food.
