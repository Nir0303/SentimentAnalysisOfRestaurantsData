Within five minutes of the 5:00 pm opening, every seat was filled with enthusiastic diners.  The conveyor belt can be charming.  Nearly everything is uramaki or \"sushi rolls\" with rice wrapped around a piece of fish or vegetable.  Most of the offerings, like the California Roll are designed for American palates and usually unknown in Japan.  After an hour of waiting and watching, I never saw any nigiri, the type of sushi that consists of fish wrapped around a ball of rice.  Apparently nigiri style sushi is not as popular as rice rolls with this place's patrons.  I also noticed that unlike every sushi place I have ever patronized--including the ones at Whole Foods markets--the itamae, sushi chefs, were not wearing some kind of uniform, not even a white ccok's coat.  These gentlemen simply wore a black apron and cap over their street clothes.  Iconoclasts?  Maybe  To reiterate, Sushi Somo is popular with locals but it is not a place I can recommend.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-29T11:04:03-0400", "location_id": "1099987", "id": "432720127", "user": {"username": "Tony V", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "love the sushi trolly thing...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32422-d1099987-r423002401-m11068-Sushi_Sumo-Gardena_California.html#review423002401", "text": "Very upbeat, from the moment you enter you notice the movement of servers, the live hands of sushi chefs and the delicious sushi going around...it goes well with a tall Sapporo!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-27T19:53:13-0400", "location_id": "1099987", "id": "423002401", "user": {"username": "Alma A", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Delicious without breaking a bank", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32422-d1099987-r398116117-m11068-Sushi_Sumo-Gardena_California.html#review398116117", "text": "Loved the food!

There are 2 \"Itamae\", sushi chefs, in the middle who turn out yummy sushi the whole time and you pick up whatever plates of sushi you want that come by on the belt. Each colored plate is a different price so you can add them up as you go. It's actually pretty entertaining as well. If your in the mood for sushi & in the area, I suggest going.
