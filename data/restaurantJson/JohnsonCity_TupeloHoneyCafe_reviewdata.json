The architecturally nice railroad station has been beautifully restored to it's original charm as part of the restoration of many of the historic buildings in Johnson City.  The second thing you notice is the unusual selection of items on the menu.  It is a nice selection of their take on southern dishes and I believe they have done a great job.  My favorite was the okra.  Very crunchy with a unique blend of spices and perfectly salted.  Yum.  The chicken BLT was juicy and again with a unique blend of spices that made the taste delightful and unlike what you typically experience at other restaurants.  Served up with great southern style biscuits and of course Tupelo Honey.  Definitely a great place to eat in Johnson City.  Enjoy the building and savor the delicious food.  Thank you Tessa for being a wonderful and attentive waitress.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-10T14:46:26-0400", "location_id": "4820839", "id": "426794669", "user": {"username": "Tennessee50plus", "user_location": {"name": "Springfield, Tennessee", "id": "55357"}}}]}
