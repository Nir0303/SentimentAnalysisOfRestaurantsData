Great place to catch up with friends - nice ambience for talking and intimate get togethers. A bit pricey on the coffees and desserts. Free wifi. Came in on a Friday night; sat in one of the nicely decorated booths. There were only 2 servers that night for a place than can hold 60+ people. It was difficult to grab someone to refill our water or ask for an extra spoon for dessert. Nobody checked on us after food was served. We noticed better service and follow-up were given to Korean customers (young servers spoke Korean). Sweet potato fries was so-so. Mac and cheese had an over-powering bitter taste of truffle. Seafood pasta in white sauce was bland and lacked taste. Enjoyed the huge snow ice- they were generous with fruits and Mochi. \n\nIt doesn't interest me to go back...", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-31T12:57:00-0500", "location_id": "2457112", "id": "251988960", "user": {"username": "OC_M_Lu", "user_location": {"name": "Orange County, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-01", "title": "Pricey", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32122-d2457112-r191167403-m11068-Cafe_7th_Home-Buena_Park_California.html#review191167403", "text": "This restaurant is a converted house that sits in a residential area.
