Yes, it has TVs, but they aren't loud (thank you, managers!). It's comfy. You can talk to everyone at your table and hear what they are saying. There's seating at tables or at the bar, and there is another half of the restaurant for pool tables and games, but you'd probably not realize it if you didn't look for it on entering. The food is definitely good, and sometimes even really creative and interesting. (Try the Katy Flyer burger, the Bayou salad, or the fish tacos.)  And--it has a nice list of craft beers available on tap. Some of the original waitstaff are still there, too.
