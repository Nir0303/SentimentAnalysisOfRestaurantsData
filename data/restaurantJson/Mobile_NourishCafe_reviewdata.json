It's worth searching out, nothing else like it in downtown. The menu is small but changes regularly and offers very unique, healthy choices including vegetarian. Food was absolutely delicious (chef quality), very high quality ingredients (homemade bread & REAL tomatoes from the farmers' market, etc.), portions large, prices very reasonable. I'll be a regular. Easy walk from downtown hotels or park free in the Y lot.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-25T12:29:35-0400", "location_id": "11741152", "id": "431609157", "user": {"username": "SFEMobile", "user_location": {"name": "Mobile", "id": null}}}]}
