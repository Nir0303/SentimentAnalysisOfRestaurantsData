If you've never tried South Indian food you must come try a Dosa.  It's a GF lentil crispy crepe that is often filled with things like potatoes and onions- large but light and made for 1-1.5 people.  Also, the Chicken Biryani is great- similar to a fried rice (but with curry flavors).  The owners are friendly and welcoming.  You might notice the restaurant name has changed recently to Curry's Indian Cafe.
