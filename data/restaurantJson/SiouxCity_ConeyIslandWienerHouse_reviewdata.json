George Margeas opened this store in 1918 and ran it his whole life.  His son Steve Margeas has been running it every since.  He and his wife Virginia can be found in the store every day.  In my mind, they make the difference.  It's their restaurant, their history, and their love.\n\nThe restaurant is located on Nebraska St between 5th and 6th street.  As far as looks go, it's nothing special beyond the history of how long it's been here.  I do like seeing the hot dogs on the grill through the window from the street.  It's a nice touch.\n\nThe coney's are absolutely wonderful.  Steve still makes them while you wait.  He pulls out a soft bun from the steamer and lays a hot dog from the grill in it.  Mustard is applied to the side with a dip stick (love that tradition).  Chili still made the same way as it was in 1918 is spooned over the hot dog.  Freshly diced onions top it off.  Once George is done Virginia will finish off the sides and drinks and ring you up.  Cash only!\n\nWhile the hot dot is being prepared right in front of you, George and his wife are talking up a storm.  They are the sweetest couple.  I cannot decide if I keep visiting when I come back to enjoy them or the awesome coney.  Either way, I get both and that makes this place a rock star.\n\nI am very sad that their son George S. Margeas died unexpectedly in 2009.  He had his own store opened and was running it.  He was the heir apparent to keep this store going.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-26T07:54:34-0400", "location_id": "5002984", "id": "431819519", "user": {"username": "CraftBeers", "user_location": {"name": "Plano, Texas", "id": "56463"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "authentic coney dogs and other great menu items", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38400-d5002984-r428943941-m11068-Coney_Island_Wiener_House-Sioux_City_Iowa.html#review428943941", "text": "Family-owned, authentic recipes, and retro atmosphere----can't go wrong!

They are not open Sunday.\nWhen you come to CI, get the chili dog. It was what they are known for and what they do best. I like mine with ketchup and other locals enjoy adding onions. Service is usually fast but I have not always found it to be the friendliest. That could be because I am not there very often and no one knows me.
