It is dedicated to Alice Sabatini who was a local artist who passed away in the late '90s.  What I like about the Gallery is that it is every changing.  Sometimes the Gallery features oils or watercolors.  I've seen beautiful exhibits of pottery and photographic art.  The Sabatini family does a wonderful job of honoring Alice Sabatini.  Do take some time to visit this lovely Gallery.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-03-20T13:46:52-0400", "location_id": "7827106", "id": "260775474", "user": {"username": "TheBoysGrandma", "user_location": {"name": "Lawrence, Kansas", "id": "38836"}}}]}
