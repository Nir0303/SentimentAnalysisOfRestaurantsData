The chile relleno burrito was large and a good value, but nothing special.  Definitely better than Taco Bell across the street and not much more expensive.  Unfortunately the place had a bad vibe due to the distant attitude of the girl at the register.  This is particularly surprising at a Mexican place where people are generally more than friendly.  And it wasn't a language issue, as I speak fluent Spanish.  The water in the soda mahine had a very unpleasant chemical taste.

Yes, the prices are pretty cheap, but then again so are all the other very good taquerias that are frequented by the hispanic population in the Lakewood area.
