The hostess initially tried to seat us at a table for two set up in the private room which was already occupied by a party of about 20, but we refused.  The service was a little spotty.

The name suggests the speciality is sushi and it was. We were looking for a light dinner and with the menu being very comprehensive, there was lots of choices and a change to reorder if we wished. \nWe also picked this place based on it's proximity to our hotel. Don't you hate it when you are in a new place at night and nothing seems familiar. You just want to get to your hotel rather than tour the city!\nStrangely enough this restaurant was right down town. We expected traffic/ parking issues. Neither was the case as we ended up parking the car three doors down from this restaurant and it took us 10 minutes to get there. You can't beat that!\nWe ordered a draft beer (double IPA) which had great flavor and was cold to suit the warm temps here in Modesto.\nI have difficulty remembering what we  ordered  but one of the orders was rainbow roll. I ordered a roll of something and a soba soup. Everything was excellent and we were full. Good portions and fresh. The soba soup should have lots of fish in it but it was still good with the large noodles that I like. When I left some soup in the dish, I asked the waiter to put it is in doggy bag. Before telling her that I was kidding, she was willing to do so. We all laughed.\nThe only criticism I had was that the waiter was a little too much in a hurry to serve us. This is a personal assessment but it was a feeling.\nThe restaurant had padded seats around the edges of the restaurant with a private venue for the more romantic(?) The other tables had 2 or more seats.  The music was probably ok for the people that were there but as more people arrive the overall noise level could be a factor for some. We usually like a quieter time to be able to talk between us without raising our voices. \nThe evening went well as we left with a full stomach and a happy heart.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-06T09:52:04-0400", "location_id": "4741816", "id": "362074867", "user": {"username": "Brian B", "user_location": {"name": "Nokomis, Florida", "id": "34477"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Impressive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32724-d4741816-r361854530-m11068-Raw_Sushi_Bistro-Modesto_California.html#review361854530", "text": "The sushi was great.

The restaurant gets packed so I suggest reservations.  Everything is amazing!  I especially enjoy the Spicy Sesame Tuna Appetizer, it's seared tuna that is served with chili oil in a ponzu sauce...so delicious!  The specialty rolls are HUGE!  Enough for three people! The presentation is beautiful too!  The Sashimi is of the highest quality, exceptionally fresh and tasty. They have a great drink selection too and a good size bar area.  The ambience, service, food, everything is excellent here...can't wait to go back!  They also have live music most weekends.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-15T09:40:24-0400", "location_id": "4741816", "id": "355694476", "user": {"username": "soulsisters", "user_location": {"name": "Modesto, California", "id": "32724"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Birthday Celebration ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32724-d4741816-r349841493-m11068-Raw_Sushi_Bistro-Modesto_California.html#review349841493", "text": "Awesome place!
