Excellent dessert. Steak cooked perfectly. Every dish we ordered, from the steak to the salmon was poorly seasoned though. Overpriced when you consider we would have enjoyed outback or something similar more for half the price.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "deidre w, Operating Partner at Texas Cattle Company, responded to this review", "text": "I am disappointed to hear you did not enjoy your recent dinner with us, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you.
