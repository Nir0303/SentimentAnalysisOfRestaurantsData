It was good though!) We both had kekas ... a Mexican pastry like an empenada ... mine was Keka de Huitlacoche (a fungus that grows in corn cobs)  .... to be honest,  I couldn't look at it or think about it;  however,  it was delicious!  My wife had Keka de flor de calabaza  (squash blossom) ... also delicious.  We both had platas  (plates) ... hers was cochinita pibil  (a pork stew) and mine was rajas con crema  (poblano pepper strips,  onion,  and kernel corn in a cream sauce). They come with rice and frijoles refritas  (refried beans that had chorizo and seasoning) ... both dinners were delicious!  We had postres  (dessert) ... I had choco flan and she had cheesecake .... also delicious and made here.  Parking could be an issue since the parking lot is a small lot with only 6 or 7 parking spaces.  Driveway is to the left side of the house.  Definitely worth finding though ... some of the absolute best Mexican food I've had!
