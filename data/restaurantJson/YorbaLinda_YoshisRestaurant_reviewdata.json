But this isn't just your average restaurant- Yoshi's, with its delicious sushi and great value, tops my list for Japanese restaurants in the area. I never tried sushi before, but thanks to my experience here, I can tell it's the first of many!\n\nThe restaurant itself is fairly large, with plenty of tables and a full-on sushi bar. It is also well-lit and spacious. Our party was seated immediately and served vinegar-tasting cucumbers and coleslaw as complimentary appetizers, which were pretty good. The service continued to be efficient throughout our meal, although we had to keep asking for drink refills.\n\nI ordered a lunch special with terriyaki chicken and tempura ($5.75), which was a great deal, since it also came with miso soup, rice, salad, orange slices, and potato salad, served on a large plate. Everyone else enjoyed their food, too. But the sushi was what was truly excellent! We had several orders to share, including crunchy rolls (heavenly!) and spicy tuna rolls (which I didn't try because I'm still leery of raw fish), and a sampler. I tried the crunchy rolls and the California rolls, both of which I loved.\n\nSo come to Yoshi's! It's a great place for a first-time sushi experience, and I think tried and true sushi lovers will enjoy it as well.
