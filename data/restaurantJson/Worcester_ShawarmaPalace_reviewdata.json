It lived up to the reviews we had seen. I had the Beef Shawarma Wrap and my companion had the Kibbeh plate - both of which were delightful and well presented.\n\nThis is a small place with just a few tables. It is very warm and cozy and the owner is so attentive to every person that we felt like we had known him for a long time. It is very clean and service is fast and efficient. Shawarma is a storefront counter which seems to do a lot of take out business as well as serving those who are staying to eat there.\n\nAs we were leaving the owner gave us a piece of his special Baklava. It was delicious and we were so pleased with this gesture.\n\nI took two spinach pizzas home. They were awesome. The also offer meat pies pies, spinach pies and other types of pizza.  Will be going back!\n\nThere is street parking or a parking garage is nearby", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-31T06:20:14-0500", "location_id": "8006955", "id": "344014938", "user": {"username": "BCM475", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Best Shawarma Ever!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41952-d8006955-r337819190-m11068-Shawarma_Palace-Worcester_Massachusetts.html#review337819190", "text": "The Best Beef Shawarma we have had ever!
