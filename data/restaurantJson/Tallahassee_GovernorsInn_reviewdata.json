It is the only place I stay when coming to Tallahassee, and I come almost exclusively for business.  The rooms are fine...antique style furniture, comfy beds, in most rooms.  Each is unique.  I have stayed in all courtyard, some interior, and most loft suites.  \n\nI don't think anything has changed in the last 10 years, so it probably about time for some renovation.  Over the years though, it has gone downhill in many other respects.\n\nCleanliness...relatively ok, used to be better. I have had rooms with rings around toilets, hair on floor, etc., especially in the past year or so.  Dust is visible.  Thankfully they have reinforced the courtyard doors with deadbolts, because they used to just open.  They have had AC issues, but always moved me to another room if my original room was subpar.  \n\nBiggest complaint is the service now.  Valet is present, somewhere purportedly.  Never when you seem to need it.  No one greets you anymore, it seems, and you always wait for someone to show up at front desk.  I usually bring my own bags to my room now, otherwise who knows when someone will be available to bring them.  A few years ago they used to have room service through a local eatery.  Not sure what happened but they do not have that anymore, and the continental breakfast seems more sparse with each visit.  They purportedly have a managers happy hour...I usually am not able to make it, but they used to have a good selection of beer and wine available after as well.  Now, the selection is insulting.  Frontera  something for white, and Fronterra Merlot for red.  All 1.5L.  This is a $9 bottle, for 1.5l.  Are you serious?! Is this a college student hotel? I understand we are in Tallahassee, but after happy hour you charge guests and $5 for a glass of this garbage is ridiculous.  I don't care about the price, keep some quality wine on site if you keep wine at all. And beer...bud light, mich ultra? They used to be have a decent selection. Again, we are not college students. I understand they don't have to have anything, but please don't insult your clientele with such horrible selections.  This hotel has the reputation of a higher class hotel in Tallahassee, and it used to be.  Now, not so much.  Please Governor's, step it up.  This hotel used to be the crown jewel of hotels in the area.  Now, it feels like they are trying to get by with the barest of everything.  The towels are even ratty now.  Location is huge, and they have that going, but the quality of stay has continuously decreased in the past 10 years, and drastically in the last 2.  \n\nI really would recommend that Governor's evaluate its quality and reinstate some of the things that used to make this a great place to stay.

Although mostly positive, it seemed there was also a lot of negative.  Truly, there is no negative.  This place is wonderful - from the time you check in until the time you check out.\n\nAs soon as I arrived, I was greeted warmly by both the valet and the front desk reception.  Both of them asked me what they could do to make my stay better.  I felt entirely comfortable asking them all kinds of questions about Tallahassee and they were both very knowledgeable.\n\nI booked a Courtyard room on the first floor loft and it was lovely.  You have to walk a few steps upstairs to get to it but is that really a big deal?  A lot of the reviews talked about the fact that there is no elevator and you have to lug your bags upstairs.  The valet was perfectly happy to grab my bags for me but I am perfectly capable of carrying them myself and climbing stairs.  If you are a person who cannot climb stairs, there are rooms on the first floor - a ton of them.  \n\nIf you stay there, you get 20% off the sushi restaurant a few steps away.  The place is AWESOME!  Best Sushi I have had in a long time.  Jasmine - fantastic.  Soup, salad and two sushi rolls for $10 bucks.  With the 20% off, $8 bucks!  \n\nI had a big interview at the Capitol the next day and I was exhausted.  The bed was truly wonderful and comfy.  It was the first time I have slept past 7 am in months.  And the pillows were fine.  Someone complained that they were lumpy - not the case.  Yes, they are foam pillows but it you want feather pillows, bring your own (I did).  \n\nThe toiletries in the bathroom are wonderful and they are in a lovely little basket with lots of towels.  The display was just adorable and a nice touch.\n\nThey have complimentary wine and you do have to ask for it.  I'm pretty sure they'll let you have as much as you want - although I didn't drink any of it because of the pending interview.  Still, another nice touch.\n\nBreakfast the next day is a continental breakfast.  I also saw a bunch of reviews complaining about breakfast.  I suppose people want them to make omelets or something.  They had cereal, toast, muffins, yogurt and bagels - I had an asiago bagel which was out of this world.  Yummy.  They also have a make your own waffle station - the kids love that!  The coffee, too, which was necessary before heading to the Capital, was really good.\n\nAll in all, I can say that when I go to Tallahassee, I won't stay anywhere else.

What a lovely inn, though. You just can't find this kind of styling and charm in new construction. So, what it lacks in brand new-ness, it makes up for in authenticity. Check in was a breeze. The valet parking was convenient. Our room was on the 2nd floor and close to the front of the hotel. THAT was a small problem, in that it was a Thursday night in a college town, and the hotel is across the street from a popular bar. Someone parked their truck in the road near the hotel and the pounding bass was a major annoyance as we tried to fall asleep. Additionally, the room was over the breakfast area, so we were awakened around 6 a.m. by the clatter of dishes. I requested a move to the back of the hotel, and we were accommodated with not penalty or resistance. (Obviously, it helped that the hotel was not fully booked.) Just ask for a room at the back of the hotel when you book your room.
