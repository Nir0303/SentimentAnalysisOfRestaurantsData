The servers are locals who are always friendly and strive to please.  \nWe often order one of their great omelets for breakfast, filled with avocado, mushrooms and cheese, accompanied by a side of grilled potatoes and your choice of toast (we like the English muffins). They have excellent, freshly brewed coffee and if your appetite will still allow, ask for an order of their delicious Nutella/banana crepes topped with a dollop of whipped cream. So, yummy!  And if this still isn't quite enough for you, they are usually featuring one of those fabulous old movies from the 30's or 40's when the stars were truly Hollywood's finest!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-11T14:38:24-0400", "location_id": "516034", "id": "363472529", "user": {"username": "Georgette K", "user_location": {"name": "San Clemente, California", "id": "33012"}}}]}
