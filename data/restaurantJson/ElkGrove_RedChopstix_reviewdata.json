The food was served lava hot so you know it wasn't being held under a warmer.That was the great part of this restaurant. The food was bland. The House Wonton Soup was loaded with yummy things, but the broth tasted watered down. We ordered the Po Po appetizer. They were out teriyaki beef, but the waitress (again awesome) asked what we would like as a substitute for the beef. The ribs from the Po Po were seasoned the best of anything we ordered but they were extremely fatty making them almost impossible to eat. The beef and pea pods entree had very crisp pea pods and they were a little too plentiful. The dish should have been called pea Pods and Beef. It had a small amount of a brown sauce and a few sesame seeds and no distinct flavor. Just an average dish. The House Fried Rice was also just okay. I wanted to soak it in soy sauce for flavor. The food was not bad, just average. The place is clean, the waitress was great, and prices are good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-07T02:02:50-0500", "location_id": "933116", "id": "353525821", "user": {"username": "Cali-Fla", "user_location": {"name": "Elk Grove, California", "id": "32349"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Decent local place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32349-d933116-r332081133-m11068-Red_Chopstix-Elk_Grove_California.html#review332081133", "text": "The service is very good and the atmosphere is typical for a Chinese restaurant.

The sesame chicken is excellent and they will serve it a la carte even though it is only on the combo menu.
