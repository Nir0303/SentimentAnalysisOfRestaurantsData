It was surprisingly empty when we first arrived, but began to fill up a bit after about 30 minutes.  Friday & Saturday nights are karaoke night, and it seems to bring people in, but it never really got too crowded, where it was uncomfortable.  It really had a welcoming, friendly atmosphere.  If you've never been, you might be surprised to see all of the Elvis memorabilia displayed all over the restaurant, so if you have a problem with Elvis, that might be an issue, otherwise it's pretty quirky-cool.\n\nI guess they are famous for their garlic tacos, with either chicken or beef, they come in crunchy shells, and the garlic dressing is very garlicky; they are really, really, delicious! My husband had the Mexico City Burrito which comes with your choice of meat, the standard is pork, but you can choose another.  He said it was very good, and it looked delicious. Our daughter had the children's Taquitos (minus the sour cream) which also comes with guacamole.  My daughter loves them, and I have tasted them, and they are quite good; loaded with all white meat shredded chicken.  They are also very large, not the typical skinny taquito.  This time, along with the complimentary chips and salsa, we started with an appetizer of chicken wings.  They were some of the best wings I've had in a restaurant.  The skin was actually crispy, and cooked well done, unlike a lot of places that serve soft chewy skin.  The buffalo sauce is a spicy garlic buffalo sauce which is out of this world yummy, yet not as spicy as I would expect.\nAfter we ate, we stayed to watch some of the patrons and employees sing karaoke.  That was a lot of fun, our daughter even had the courage to go up and give it a try (she's very shy and normally would not do anything like that, but this restaurant was so warm and friendly she felt at home).  Everyone was so nice to her, the staff, and the customers, cheering her on, and fussing over her when she was done singing Taylor Swift's \"Shake it Off\".
