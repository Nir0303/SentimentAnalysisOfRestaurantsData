We were made to feel very welcome.  The waiters were very knowledgeable and took great care of us.  One of our party was on a gluten free diet and the waiter was able to work with the chef to suggest many options.   She was thrilled!  The appetizers were amazing and our main course was delicious.  I think everyone was very happy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-09T09:38:55-0500", "location_id": "4035853", "id": "354145554", "user": {"username": "JAWJ459", "user_location": {"name": "Suwanee, Georgia, USA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Friendly, Attentive Service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1966009-d4035853-r353553742-m11068-1001_Nights_Persian_Cuisine-Johns_Creek_Georgia.html#review353553742", "text": "My daughter recommended this restaurant based upon having carry-out with a friend one night.  She enjoyed the kabob\u2019s they ordered out so she wanted to experience sit-down dinner.  The service and food were very good.  Although we have a wide pallet, we have not dined on Persian often so it is difficult for us to compare to other Persian dining experiences.  After dinner at 1001 Nights, we will be dining on Persian more often.   Upon walking in we were asked if this was our first visit; we were welcomed and thanked for giving them a try.  The waiter was extremely helpful and gave us plenty of time to explore the menu.  The eggplant appetizer with Nan was outstanding, my daughter ordered the chicken kabob\u2019s, I had the beef and my wife ordered lamb.  We all agreed the food was very good quality, served hot and very tasty.  About halfway through dinner the owner who greeted us upon arrival came to our table and inquired as to if everything was satisfactory.  We assured him that it was.   We will return to further explore the menu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-07T04:09:54-0500", "location_id": "4035853", "id": "353553742", "user": {"username": "2Here4Fun", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta, Georgia", "id": "60898"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Great first experience with Persian food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1966009-d4035853-r350884537-m11068-1001_Nights_Persian_Cuisine-Johns_Creek_Georgia.html#review350884537", "text": "Wasn't sure what to expect.
