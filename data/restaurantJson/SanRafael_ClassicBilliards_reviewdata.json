It's an all-age, family-oriented spot. Serious players and just-for-fun players go. Moms and Dads take their kids.  There's food available, beer, music..and ping pong!. With two floors of tables it's a pool leaguer's haven.. So if you're visiting and want to entertain friends or family; stage a birthday party  or just play a while, there's no place like it north of the Golden Gate.  We hear that Classic is soon to be a mecca for table and billiard equipment.
