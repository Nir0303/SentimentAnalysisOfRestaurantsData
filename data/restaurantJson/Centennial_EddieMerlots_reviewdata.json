I would put it on par with the last steak I had a the Palm in DC which was just superb.  Service is impeccable and attentive, but not overly so (bothersome) and all of the staff from the hostess to the server to the water glass filler were all very friendly and engaging.  Kudos to Eddie's for a superb meal once again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-20T12:46:36-0400", "location_id": "8015814", "id": "365779299", "user": {"username": "COJeff", "user_location": {"name": "Castle Rock, Colorado", "id": "33345"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Excellent Meal - Great Salmon!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33412-d8015814-r357908187-m11068-Eddie_Merlot_s-Englewood_Colorado.html#review357908187", "text": "Very attentive staff, excellent food and wine selection.

And she did. My wife and I have dined here before and liked the food. Last night was no exception. Our server Darylynn answered our questions about the menu and made helpful suggestions for us.\n\nThere was a spring fixed price menu, but we opted for the regular menu. We dined on sea bass, the prime NY strip (dry-aged, I suspect), with beet and spinach salads. For side dishes, we ordered sweet potato casserole (excellent!), mac & cheese (yummy!), and broccoli. The food was very good. For dessert, we went with key lime pie and carrot cake (can be easily shared by 4 people) a la mode.\n\nOn Sundays, Eddie Merlot's has a wine special. For any wine served by the glass, you can get a full bottle at half price. So, we enjoyed a bottle of Ghost Pines Zinfandel Blend at a substantial savings. It was also a perfect complement to the steak.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-03-21T10:47:43-0400", "location_id": "8015814", "id": "357367962", "user": {"username": "jandc8491", "user_location": {"name": "Denver, Colorado", "id": "33388"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Another great experience at Eddie's", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33412-d8015814-r353582898-m11068-Eddie_Merlot_s-Englewood_Colorado.html#review353582898", "text": "You can't beat the service and food at Eddie's.
