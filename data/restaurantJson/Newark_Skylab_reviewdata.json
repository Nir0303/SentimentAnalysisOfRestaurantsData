From the time of arrival until the time we left, the service was excellent! Thank you Keisha! You were awesome! \nThe space is somewhat accommodating inside with the outdoor terrace being a bit narrow. To move around outside, it was somtimes necessary to step inside to go around. The immediate view was of downtown Newark. The old Prudential building and the Prudential Center. Far away in the distance there is a view of lower manhattan and the Freedom Tower. \nThe drinks were okay, but were served in plastic cups. Didnt like that at all. Everything in plastic cups: wine, sangria, cocktail and shots all in plastic cups. \nHad some finger bar food that was just okay. \nMy overall rating is excellent because of the service and the time had with friends.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-19T12:35:48-0400", "location_id": "7696894", "id": "301232699", "user": {"username": "Gladimobayla", "user_location": {"name": "Summit", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Awesome Views", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46671-d7696894-r271279594-m11068-Skylab-Newark_New_Jersey.html#review271279594", "text": "Visited this rooftop lounge for Mother's Day and had an awesome time.
