They were always warmly greeting me wherever I went. Security there is wonderful as you use your room key to get access to your floor unless you're going to the open floors (meeting rooms are on 5th floor.. etc ).\nI had dinner at their restaurant, sea bass, and it was perfect. I don't particularly like fish unless it DOESN'T taste like fish so I only get that dish at upscale restaurants. Light, flaky and sooo fresh. \nThere is a jazz group that played later Friday night in a small room between the bar and dining area. Perfect. Great music but far enough away that conversations were easy.\nProfessional basketball teams stay here at times,one was leaving as I was arriving, so you may run into a famous face if your timing is good.\nArt work is plentiful everywhere and magnificent.

It's about a 2 & 1/2 hour drive from Jacksonville, FL for us.  Hurricane Matthew made it's presence known to FL earlier in the week hitting Orlando Wednesday night & into Thursday then Jacksonville Thursday night & into Friday.  By Saturday, the sun was shining for us in Jacksonville & we left at lunch time.\n\nThe hotel did not have any damage or lose power.  Valet parking is the only option ($25 daily fee).  We were on the top floor (15th) & room was spacious & comfortable.  There's a mini-fridge that's already stocked w/water, beer, soda & wine.  When I inquired about a mini-fridge for personal use for the items we brought w/us, we were told that none were available & to check in the morning as people checked out.  In the meantime, we were told to empty the fridge of the items that were in there & put in our personal items until another fridge became available.  I questioned this since I knew the items in the fridge were on a time-sensor.  Once removed, you will be billed.  I was assured that the room account would have a note that we were using the fridge for our personal items.\n\nI emptied the stocked mini-fridge & added our personal items.  On Sunday, a fridge became available & was delivered to the room.  We added our personal items & put back the other items in the other fridge.  Upon checkout we noticed that every item that was removed from the stocked mini-fridge had been added to our invoice.  The charges were promptly removed upon explanation.  Of note, the items on top where the TV is (2 Evian Water Bottles & several gourmet cans of nuts) are also on a time-sensor.\n\nThe workout room & pool are on the 6th floor.  Workout room is lavish.  Plenty of free weights, 2 bikes, 4 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, yoga mats, medicine balls, foam rollers, stretch bands (straps), et cetera.\n\nElevator only works w/room key.  Room floors are from 6th thru 15th.  Had one drink in the bar while waiting on our room to be ready.  Bar area also has restaurant.  \n\nHotel does recycle (I found this out when I called).
