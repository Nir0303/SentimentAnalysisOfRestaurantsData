We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess staff and led to a table. This Glendale location is not that big, so it's no wonder there are long wait times when they are busy.\n\nWe ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), cucumber salad, spicy won tons, braised beef noodle soup and shrimp & pork shu mai. The dishes were brought out one at a time in a timely manner. Everything was delicious, especially the sauce that comes with the spicy won tons.\n\nThe service was pleasant and efficient.
