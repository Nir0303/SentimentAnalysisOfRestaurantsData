I was quite excited to get an accommodation (on previous occasions they were booked solid) for a night during Labor Day Weekend.  \n\nA few days before leaving, I received a note from the owner of Adobe that he had accidentally over-booked the room at Adobe, however, as a kind gesture, offered me a room here at Hinds House for two nights, FREE.  Yes, I was disappointed at the cancellation at Adobe (wanted to take the g/f for a special weekend), but since other plans were in place, I took up the offer to stay at Hinds House for one night. \n\nThe Hinds House, I believe is more suited to long term stays (weekly/monthly).  It seems like a place visiting professors would stay.   It is an elegantly appointed Victorian home 3 blocks from downtown Santa Cruz.   It is in a very quiet location.   There are 3 levels, I believe, some rooms with private bathrooms and some without.   We stayed on the 2nd level, and, had to walk up to the third floor to use the bathroom.  I couldn't care  less about this, but often times, women do!   Comfortable robes were included in the room, which allows for a comfortable transition from the shower to the bedroom.  \n\nThere is a kitchen inside the house, beautiful rooms in which to sit and read a book.  An old antique piano adds to the decor. \n\nYes, the beds here are amazing.  Definitely not cheap beds! \n\nIn the rooms, there are small sinks for washing or getting a drink of water.  Also, there is a very well organized binder with a significant amount of tourist information including where to eat, parks, etc.  Very useful.   I used the free wi-fi in the house to get additional information on things to do in Santa Cruz.  There is a computer downstairs for those who are traveling w/o a wi-fi card (complimentary).   Very cool. \n\nIt was a very fun, memorable experience staying in this historical home in Santa Cruz.  \n\nThe gentlemen that runs the Hinds House also runs Adobe.  Although I have yet to stay at Adobe, both places are obviously managed VERY well.  I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend either place as options in Santa Cruz.

Don't forget that this place is for extended stays - not overnite options.  However, the price per week is so fabulous that you'll want to stay the week.\n\nPros:  \n1. We stayed over the Xmas holidays and were very sad to leave.  To quote an earlier Japanese resident, this house has good karma - a really good feel to it.  I've always liked Santa Cruz and this was such a treat.  I've stayed in many places but this is the one place I'd really like to come back to.  \n\n2.  Incredibly and totally unbelievably comfortable beds, Victorian furnishings, multiple full bathrooms scattered throughout the house, well-equipped kitchen for cooking, well marked cabinets and fridges per room, washer/dryer on premises with complimentary washing powder, parking permits for on-stret parking etc., given to you on arrival.  There are three first-come, first serve parking spots behind the house and on-street parking (which we did not have any problems finding).  Think a hostel for grownups - very lovely, comfortable with the ease of coming and going as you like.  Very clean!\n\n3. Great location (4 blocks west of Pacific Avenue that has all sorts of places to eat plus a New Leaf grocery store in the old Bank of Italy building if you prefer to cook).  We recommend Sitar if you like Indian food and for girly hand creams, candles, and makeup, I recommend Farmacy located across the street from Hoffmann's Bakery (which is also yummy).  Everything is within walking distance although West Cliff Drive is further out.  I'd suggest driving out there, parking and then doing the 6 mile round trip walk along the coast.  You can hole up in your room (which is great for writing/research purposes) as they have desks and WiFi or you can mingle downstairs in one of the 2 drawing rooms, dining room or kitchen.\n\nCons: \n1. We booked a large room with private bath not realizing it was  a bathtub/toilet combo with no venting vs the typical shower/toilet combo. Our fault for not reading closely enough.  We never did use the tub although the private toilet was nice.  However, there are 2 full bathrooms with showers on the 3rd floor, a full bathroom with tub on 2nd floor and a full bathroom with tub on 1st floor off the kitchen.  All rooms have their own sink (if not reserving one of the two private bath facilities).  If you book off season, I recommend taking the shared bathroom option as there was no problems in finding access times to it.  Plus, the shared option is considerably cheaper.  \n\n2. Stairs. This is what gives Hinds House the 4 star rating instead of the 5 star rating - at least until some protection is added on.  There are grand stairs here in this house and most of them are wide enough for easy navigation.  However, the problem is the second set of 8-10 stairs leading from the third story on down to the second story level.  Be very careful on them as it is exceptionally easy to slip and fall (which I did).

I wanted to stay somewhere furnished where I could have a kitchen.  I was hoping to find someplace interesting and not too instututional like a standard hotel.  A friend told me about the Hinds House.  My stay was better than I could have ever imagined.  \n\nThis place is a beautifully maintained 1888 Victorian mansion with all the original woodwork and materials intact.  There are 10 guest rooms on two floors, some with shared baths (that's what I chose) and some with private baths.  The whole ground floor is divoted to common rooms where guests can lounge around in the parlor, play the grand piano in the sitting room or eat in the ornate dining room.  The main floor has a full kitchen that is equipped with everything down to baking supplies and salad spinners.  Each guest has designated space in a cupboard for food storage and space in one of three refrigerators.  The management has thought of everything: there is free wireless DSL, computer workstation, free laundry, full basement for bicycle and surfboard storage, private mailboxes and parking.  My room (#5) was beautiful and came with all that I needed including a VCR, CD player and work desk.  \n\nThe folks who own this place also run a B&B a few blocks away called the Adobe on Green Street and their experience at making places comfortable really shows.  My mattress was the most comfortable I have ever slept on.  Two of the best things about staying there were the location and the pricing.  Being on the corner of Church and Chestnut Streets, I was three blocks from the center of downtown.  I didn't have a car and I could walk to everything.  I never felt isolated or cut off from whatever I needed.  The prices are reasonable.  My room was $360 per week.  There are some rooms that are $300 per week.  The catch is there are no overnight stays.  All rates are by the week only.  All in all this was a special and rare place to be for a couple of weeks.  I just wish there were more places like this in other cities.\n", "helpful_votes": "8", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2006-01-19T19:00:00-0500", "location_id": "595032", "id": "4365850", "user": {"username": null, "user_location": {"name": "Santa Barbara", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Buen lugar, a buen precio.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33048-d595032-r360434281-m11068-Hinds_Victorian_Guest_House-Santa_Cruz_California.html#review360434281", "text": "Este hotel es una casa antigua adaptada.

Zu empfehlen ist 'Natural Bridges' - dort ist nicht nur ein toller Strand, sondern man kann dort auch sch\u00f6ne Schmetterlinge (Monarchen) in freier Wildbahn betrachten die dort ca. von Ende Oktober bis Ende Januar hinwandern aus k\u00e4lteren Regionen um dort zu \u00fcberwintern.
