I'll start there. The day I decided to go was a cold(below zero wind chill) day and I got there before the 11 am open time.  I waited and at 11 it wasn't open, called to get answering machine and waited till 1130 and ended up going next door to Coopers. There were at least three parties at Coopers that were there only because Cafe Su wasn't open. Coopers gets a lot of business from Cafe Su because it doesn't open anywhere near its advertised time(also announced on answering machine). So when I left Coopers, I decided to check to see if, after 12noon, it had opened yet. It was open but no customers yet(all were at Coopers). So I ordered takeout for a later dinner.  Apparently the previous nights staff had not bothered to clean up and the only waiter was trying to manage the complete cleanup and deal with the work ahead of him. Very nice waiter, recently back from service to our country. The order took 30 minutes to prepare two meals. I was the only customer at the time.  The hot and sour soup was good, a tad different than I'm used to, with a bit of sweet and cilantro in it, which I liked a lot.  The basil chicken was also very good. I asked the waiter to have the angry chicken made very mild. When I opened the container, it looked like a half cup of dried pepper had been added to it. Very very very spicy. And I saw the waiter write my request. Apparently the cook didn't quite understand. The atmosphere is very artsy. The good news is that Cafe Su has a chance to improve.  And I do understand the situation.  I also am very tolerant which most are not. Maybe I'll check them out again in about 6 months and see how they are doing.
