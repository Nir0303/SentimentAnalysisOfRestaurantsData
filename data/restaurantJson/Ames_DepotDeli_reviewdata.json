The turkey with apricot/rhubarb sandwich (Jive Turkey) was nice but one whole lettuce leaf means the thing just slides out at every opportunity.  The jam should be on the side and the single leaf should in tiny strips be like they do it at Downtown Deli.  So overall above average sandwiches at above average prices for average rating.
