I had a bowl of the chicken and sausage gumbo that comes with rice and a few pieces of buttered bread that was plenty filling and very reasonably priced. My wife had the fried shrimp plate that came with fried shrimp that had a nice cajun flavor, fries that also had a good seasoning, some tartar sauce, a lemon slice and 3 pieces of buttered bread. At first it didn't appear that it would be enough, but she felt full after eating the meal and said it was just right.

Not overcooked, seasonings nicely crafted, strong flavorful drinks (swamp water and hurricane), and friendly wait staff made an enjoyable night out. Seafood platter (deep fried battered oysters, shrimp, catfish), savory seafood gumbo, and cat-touffee were very good! Dessert is limited to beignets. Outdoor patio will be a popular spot when Winter wanes.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-16T18:53:57-0400", "location_id": "9454593", "id": "356207566", "user": {"username": "cellproguy", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Collins", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "New Fave", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33423-d9454593-r355131246-m11068-The_Lost_Cajun-Fort_Collins_Colorado.html#review355131246", "text": "My wife and I decided to try the Lost Cajun for the first time and were not disappointed.
