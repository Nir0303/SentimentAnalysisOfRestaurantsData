The seitan \"wings\" were really very good, but the rest of the food was too rich and over-seasoned, with some weird flavors (that all ran together because of the plating), and generally just nothing too exciting (my husband had a burger and I had the mac n shews).

My daughter who had been before said it wasn't their best night.\n\nI might have given it 4 stars except the waiter had such an attitude. He pretty much ignored us until the restaurant emptied out.

I don't know, but he sure didn't make anyone feel welcomed our party.\n\nIn full disclosure, I'm a carnivore who does try to limit red meat, but I'm married to vegan, my daughter is vegan, and my son is mostly vegetarian. We had family friend who is also a vegetarian. I also cook a lot of vegetarian recipes, so while it is not my daily diet, I'm not inexperienced.\n\nBased on other reviewers and the national reputation, I'd say my experience is due to bad night in the kitchen and a server with a bad attitude.

I was expecting a patty that was firm and not soft. It also was a red color and looked like a raw hamburger. The flavor was very bland and the only thing that tasted some what eatable was the bun, but even it was too hard. It also had lettuce that was not fresh and was wilted. The potato's that came with it where cut to thick and even the root-beer drink we ordered didn't taste right. We had a pitcher of water at our table and there was no ice in it and it tasted like tap water. It is a small place and the seating was very limited and the tables were too close together. I told the lady that served us that the food didn't taste good and she told us she appreciated the feedback and would let the cook know. No apologize at all. I have been vegetarian for 15 yrs and I have ate countless veggie burgers and what was served to us was not a burger. We should have just left after the first bite of our food and not paid almost $50 dollars for the worst meal I have ever had.

We ordered a variety of entrees and passed them around so we could all try . . . and we were all pleased with the results.  The Mac & Shews, Chickpea Vegetable Korma and Potato Gnocchi were all delicious.
