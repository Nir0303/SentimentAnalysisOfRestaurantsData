We had never had Shishito Peppers, or Japanese Sweet Potato, but what a treat!  The Shishito Peppers are flash fried, and so yummy.  Who would have thought peppers on their own could be such a tasty appetizer!  They are not too hot, just flavorful.  The Japanese Sweet potato, was served with butter on it, and was so rich, and delicious.  It has some similarities to the sweet potato taste of a regular sweet potato, but has a bit sweeter taste, to me.  It is also a bit more hardy and less creamy in the center.  I believe it was baked.  I could have eaten one of these all on my own, and I plan on getting some of them to experiment with at home!  The potstickers were eaten by my husband and daughter (I can't have MSG, but the staff went out of its way to find out, and let me know what has MSG in it), and they thought they were the best they had ever had.  For dinner both my husband and daughter had the make your own ramen, and that was a really fun and both agreed, yummy experience!  Our waitress was so helpful in recommending, per each persons' taste preference what they might like, and add ins that they might enjoy as well.  I had the Chicken Katsu Sandwich with fries.  The chicken is fried, but not in the usual way one would think, I can't describe it, but it was not greedy, or heavy, and the breeding stuck to the sandwich to make each bite a delight.   There are seasonings on it, as well as a sauce on the chicken I was not familiar with (But it had no MSG, that they told me), but was delicious.  The fries were the like none I have ever had.  So crunchy and light on the outside, yet full of soft potato on the outside.  I am not sure what type of batter they use either, but it made the fries very flavorful.  My husband had the ramen and whiskey special, and loved it.  He said the Japanese Whiskey was amazing.  My daughter and I had the Lemonade of the day, and it was a treat!  I wish I could remember the flavor, but it was so delicious I paid for another to take with me!  For dessert we had three flavors of Mochi, which to me is like ice cream with a coating similar to a marshmallow on the outside.  All of the flavors were delicious, but I highly recommend the cookies and cream flavor.

Very good food and quiet atmosphere.  This place is hard to find by following google it kept putting us in the wrong direction, we finally asked a police officer and they pointed us in the right direction.

This is a very cool spot in Downtown with a DJ spinning, cool decor, and fantastic food.  Everyone very much enjoyed their food and the service that we received from our waitress, was outstanding.
