No, I'm fairly sure that the reason for comment is the British accent that makes the \"hostess\" think we are just off the boat.  We were new 28 years ago.  Each of the last 5 or 6 visits I have said, in response to questioning from the same hostesses, that we actually live in Toronto, we are not tourists.  \nThe lighting is low, the turnover quick, the service is acceptable but obviously a result of standardized training rather than genuine warmth. The introductions \"my name is Maria and I'll be your server tonight\" and explanations are done at record pace.The menu is shorter than it once was (we have been here for 28 years)and there is a shift away from it being a Jewish-style diner. Ms. Reisman's healthy options are ones I usually avoid; those are are things like a simple stir fry, salmon dishes or low fat and low carb options.I can make those at home.  I like the carbs anywayou! That said, the fruity salad on the summer menu was good.The other salads are not as great as the ones they used to offer; quinoa, kale and so on might be fashionable but they get boring. The sandwiches lack the oomph of the originals, and are much smaller.  If that's what you want I advise a trip to Craplanskys instead. \nThe desserts are creative in that the offering of mini options is neat; maybe that encourages folks to have a dessert when they might not otherwise.  The dessert choices are too heavily leaning toward  chocolate,  and lack the good caramel meringue cake  they used to do. I think greater waffle and pancake choices, and ice cream options would encourage the casual eaters to come here,as well as the after dinner crowd.I don't know what their breakfast consumers want. \nThe menu is sufficiently broad that it can satisfy most people of all ages, but there are many missed opportunities.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-22T22:13:51-0400", "location_id": "394059", "id": "409094089", "user": {"username": "Sue M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Like stepping back in time!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54946-d394059-r408787925-m11068-Pickle_Barrel_Restaurant-Chattanooga_Tennessee.html#review408787925", "text": "Loved this little place.
