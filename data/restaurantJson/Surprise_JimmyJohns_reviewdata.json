They have the big menu on their wall and you choose from a good selection of different meats and fixins on different sandwich combos. The bread is the same on all, not airy and a nice size serving, however the items they put on the subs are different, like sprouts, avocado. Super fresh. Had the number 12 with cuc's,avocado,turkey,lettuce, tomatoes, very fresh nice size and enough fixins and meat. The staff is super fast  and the place is nice and clean with tables and some booths. Great staff all saying hi and when you leave they are all saying bye. They know the locals and the worker people and treat everyone like family. Makes you want to come back.
