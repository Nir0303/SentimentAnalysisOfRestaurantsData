Harvest is not in a strip mall. Harvest does not have a sterile interior. Harvest is not filled solely with IT geeks clacking away on laptops. Harvest is also not filled with \"Jesus freaks\" trying to \"witness\" to you while you are trying to be left in peace. And Harvest does not have crappy coffee. And I pretty much just described almost every other coffee house in BCS, in reverse.\n\nHarvest is in an old building with a beautiful war, brick interior. Indie music played at just the right volume. A vague counter-culture feel here, but this is BCS so you take what you can get.\n\nThe coffee is great, from various Texas roasters and you can get drip, chemex, cold brew, whatever floats your boat. Nice tea selection too. \n\nGreat place to study, think, and people watch. Staff are great too, friendly ad not fawning.
