Closed on holidays, Thursdays, and Sundays.\nLouis and I always enjoy going to the library.\nCD's, videos, paperback books, hard cover books are sold there at different prices.\nMagazines and newspapers quite a selection to choose from.\nCandy bars are $1.50.\nThey also sell lollipops.\nAll libraries have a children's room.\nThank You.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Katy D, Public Relations Manager at Cranston Public Library, Auburn Branch, responded to this review", "text": "Thanks for the kind words, Debra!
