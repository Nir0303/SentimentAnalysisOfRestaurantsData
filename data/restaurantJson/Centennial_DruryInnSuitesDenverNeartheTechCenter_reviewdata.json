I came to help them look.  Needed a suite so they could have their privacy and the room worked exceptionally well.  The layout consist of a king size bed with a TV, telephone, many electrical outlets, separate AC & privacy door.  The main part of the room had a sofa bed which I used, a desk, several lamps, TV, mini fridge, microwave, AC, two sinks with a separate bath/toilet area.\nThe staff was exceptionally helpful on suggesting areas of Denver, directions & providing maps.  \nThe breakfast was delicious & hardy.  The 5:30pm dinner was also very filling with salad, two soup selections, bake potato bar, two different entrees, hot dogs with chili, chips with salsa & cheese.\nAs it turned out, we were too tired to go out to eat each day so the meals provided was a God Send.  Enjoyed the Adult Beverage too.  \nAll in all, great value for the stay in Denver.  I would highly recommend this hotel for it's location & service.

There is construction in the parking area, however at the time we arrived we didn't have trouble finding a spot. Drury is our choice of hotel for their value. Free Parking, Free Wifi, Free Breakfast and Free Happy hour! For happy hour (5-7) they had salad, soup, hot dogs, nachos, pasta, popcorn, soda and 3 alcoholic beverages, all included with your stay!! The area to eat in was smaller in comparison to other Drurys. Service was phenomenal. Staff was constantly checking on us and making sure everything was clean.\nBreakfast was good, eggs, biscuits, sausage, gravy, waffles, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. There was plenty of food.\nMy kids liked the pool/ hot tub area. There was a pool, 1/2 indoor and then you could swim under a partition and be outside in the pool. \nOur room, 501, was a King Over sized suite. Essentially a king bedroom with door, a living area with pull out couch, separate sink area from toilet & shower. The toilet area was small & awkward. There were so many light switches and none of them made sense. Considering our room was facing I-25 and one whole wall was window, the sound was minimal. \nThe bed was really comfortable and the room clean. \nIt was close enough to everything without being in the middle of everything. We went to the Broncos training camp and into Denver.
