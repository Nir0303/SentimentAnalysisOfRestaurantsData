Of the three dishes - soup and wraps were a three, fried calamari was a two, and the chicken wings were dreadful.   The staff could be viewed from the open kitchen and they were slow and seemed unsure of how to prepare the dishes we ordered.  During the cooking process, an unpleasant odor of old and rancid cooking oil was wafting its way from the stove.  After my wife and I concurred that the chicken wings were unfit to be eaten as they were hard, tough and had a weird burnt off flavor, I returned the mostly uneaten dish to the cook.  My complaint was met with indifference and incomprehension. We ate here in September and earlier in the afternoon and had good food and service from a different staff.  Perhaps it was the time of day, or the owner or manager not being present that left us prey to a young and poorly trained staff. Also, we were the only ones eating from there - not a good sign.  This is just one of several eating places in this quaint and visually appealing food court in the Fifth St Public Market which is worth the trip.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-10-06T20:24:22-0400", "location_id": "4815667", "id": "179997385", "user": {"username": "marty o", "user_location": {"name": "Eugene, Oregon", "id": "51862"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "Mouthwatering good!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51862-d4815667-r176228032-m11068-Ocha_Asian_Street_Kitchen-Eugene_Oregon.html#review176228032", "text": "This was our first trip ever to Eugene, and we arrived hungry after a long trip from Bellevue, WA. Our hotel reservation was secure so we elected to drive downtown and find a place to eat. After walking for a bit and not finding something appealing, a lady who thought we looked lost asked us if we needed help. She then suggested this place inside a foodcourt. The place looked clean and the menu offered an interesting variety. We ordered the Thai Papaya Salad w medium spice, Barbecued chicken w/ rice, and Barbecued Babyback Ribs. The counter service was very friendly and courteous. The food that was cooked was even better. The salad was crunchy fresh, thai spicy and EXTRA yummy (I love papaya salad and know a bad one). My wife loved the chicken and said it was very moist inside, steaming hot and tatsy. My ribs were meaty, very substantial in quantity and the taste was a register ringing 10.\nHow we ended up there was purely by chance, but I would come back again in a heartbeat.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-09-07T14:01:03-0400", "location_id": "4815667", "id": "176228032", "user": {"username": "Callbob1", "user_location": {"name": "Brentwood, California", "id": "32108"}}}]}
