I didn't want anything! I wanted to save the next person from this horrible experience & for them just to be more careful in the future. Most of the clientele sitting there were over 50 & I could only imagine what if one of them broke a tooth & had no insurance? Plus it was hurtful in two different ways. No I will not be back.

They had a very limited variety of baked goods at our time of visit (around 11:30 in the morning) including turnovers, cookies, and orange bread to eat in or take out.\n\nThe bakery is located in the \"historic\" section of Marysville.  Upon entering, the decor was very dated and it was dark inside.  The display cases with the baked goods were smudged with fingerprints.  There were crumbs on the floor.\n\nWe entered the bakery and got in line behind a family who was completing a to go order.  The family asked for a bag and a woman with behind the counter, handed them a plastic bag.  The family asked if they could get another bag so the beignets they purchased would not get smashed, but the woman refused to give them more than one bag and insisted they just set the beignets on top.\n\nAs we stepped forward, the woman glared at my daughter who had her cell phone in her hand (she was not on it, just holding it) as we noticed a \"no cell phone\" sign.\n\nWhen we ordered our items (two apple turnovers and a chocolate croissant), my husband pulled out a $50 bill to pay with and the woman said, \"I don't have change for a fifty.\" I looked at the open cash register where another lady behind the counter was making change for a $20 bill and it saw it was overflowing with bills of many denominations. The woman saw me look at the register and she shut the drawer on abruptly on the other woman. The other lady said something about it and the woman said, \"it was poking me in the back.\"\n\nMy husband looked in his wallet for a smaller bill while we asked for a milk or chocolate milk for my daughter. She curtly said, \"I have no milk.\" My husband then asked for a Diet Coke for himself, and the woman walked over to the cooler and pulled out a Diet Coke, then announced to us, \"I have small chocolate milks, do you want one of those?\"  I looked at my daughter to see if she still wanted the milk and the woman impatiently said, \"Do you want one?\"  We replied, \"yes,\" and she grabbed one and set it down hard on the counter.\n\nAt this point, my husband decided enough was enough.  He said, \"Forget it, I'd rather not have to deal with this horrible woman,\" and turned to go out the door.  I added, \"we didn't have a smaller bill anyway,\" while the woman glared as I turned and she began saying something inaudible as we left.\n\nIf you feel that quality customer service is an important part of your dining experience, then do not eat at Oosterwyk's Dutch Bakery.  I am unable to vouch for their baked goods as our family decided not to support the rudeness we endured by purchasing any of their food.\n\nThe woman at Oosterwyk's Dutch Bakery could use some help in people skills and customer service.  I believe eating out should be an enjoyable experience that encompasses not only our taste buds, but our other feelings as well.  Customers do not appreciate being treated as if they are a burden, but want to feel welcome in the restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-07-29T19:59:21-0400", "location_id": "4553199", "id": "169822681", "user": {"username": "Jillian12345", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}]}
