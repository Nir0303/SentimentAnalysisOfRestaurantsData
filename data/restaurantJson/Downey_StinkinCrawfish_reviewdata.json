When we entered the place, I had a feeling this was not what we had in mind for lunch.  The one server (a young man) was sitting at a table busy working, it seemed he was preparing for dinner although we arrived 10 mins after they opened for lunch.  Since we were the only ones there, I assume this is why it took a while to sit us.\n\nIn all fairness, the menu seems to cater to the Mon-Fri lunch crowd while the bulk of it's business seems to be the dinner crowd.  There were flat screen TV's all over and numerous beer ads so I assume at night it can be a lively spot.\n\nWe finally settled on two items plus an app and it was simply \"something to eat.\"  Actually, I am not complaining but this place just did not \"wow\" me.  Maybe it starting with the server covering our table with plastic and my food coming in a bag.  Maybe it ended with the gentlemen next to us who decided to change their order to take out instead of eating off the table.  Whatever did not wow me, the service or lack thereof added to it. Again, it is most likely a whole new ball game in the evening but we won't find out.  The food was cooked fine, it was seasoned good (you get a choice of seasonings), and the portions were fine; the ambience reminded me of being locked in a dark rustic cabin in the valley of mountains.  Maybe the server forgot to turn on some lights.  Incidentally, after he took our order and brought us our drinks, he never returned to our table although we saw him preparing for the next meal....smile\n\nWho, checked on us, brought us the bill, or accepted payment - well, he looked like the cook because because he came out of the kitchen.  \n\nMy suggestion is visit this place on a Friday or Sat night with a thirst to quench.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-31T15:23:37-0400", "location_id": "8424664", "id": "378443369", "user": {"username": "LA-Gluttony", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Great spot for friends to meet and eat in a fun, but relaxed, atmosphere.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32308-d8424664-r376260634-m11068-Stinkin_Crawfish-Downey_California.html#review376260634", "text": "Wonderful little Cajun eatery with fast service, great food, and a friendly atmosphere.
