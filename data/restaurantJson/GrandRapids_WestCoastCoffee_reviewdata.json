We visited during Art Prize event in Grand Rapids.  The cappucino I had was very good, not bitter.  My partner had the Caramel Royale.  She liked it a lot, but it was too sweet for me.  (i generally do not like sweets.)  Price was very reasonable for a handcrafted beverage. The place itself was nice for a coffee house, plenty of seating during regular days; however, being that it was Art Prize time in Grand Rapids, the place was very busy.  The barista kept things moving, and we did not have to wait long for our drinks.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-10-04T15:55:27-0400", "location_id": "4948969", "id": "232607630", "user": {"username": "DDBjen", "user_location": {"name": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "id": "42256"}}}]}
