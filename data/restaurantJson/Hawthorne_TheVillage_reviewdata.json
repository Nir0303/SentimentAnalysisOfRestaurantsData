It's a little place that faces the street with parking in the dark in the rear - there is a rear door; you don't have to go around. When we got there at 7:30pm on a Friday night, no one else was in there....a little worrisome, but online reviews had been pretty good. Because it was empty and just the two of us with a min spend $50 certificate, we decided to order just a few things to try it out and not use the cert this time. Samosas were poor for one of us, average for the other. A bit greasy and not crispy; only came out with a white chutney and we had to ask for tamarind, there was no green chutney. Entrees: 1. saag paneer - also average, paneer a bit too crispy, maybe fried in ghee first. 2. chicken karahi - really very good, tasted homemade, enough for one person, maybe more. 3. chicken biryani - the best we've had in a very long time; also tasted homemade. The naan was too dense and didn't taste very fresh, though it was hot when it came out. We brought something of everything home (except the samosas). So...stick to what they do best, maybe....Pakistani. The place is typical for value Indian/Pakistani food - glass tabletops, bright lights, corelle plates. But we'll go back for the biryani and karahi.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-07T10:04:18-0500", "location_id": "7781394", "id": "258262076", "user": {"username": "a-travelin-foodie", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}]}
