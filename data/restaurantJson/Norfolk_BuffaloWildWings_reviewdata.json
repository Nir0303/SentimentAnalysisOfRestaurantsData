As the waiter gave me a menu, he asked me if there was any game I wanted to watch. Since the Yankees were playing, I asked for the Yankee game; about a minute later, the Yankee game was on several TVs. For my meal, I ordered jalapeno chicken wings for an appetizer, a pulled pork chicken sandwich and strawberry ice cream for dessert. The pulled pork sandwich was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of barbecue sauce and the strawberry ice cream had plenty of strawberries. Ironically, the low light of the meal was the chicken wings. When the chicken wings arrived, the first thing I noticed was how small they are. The size of the chicken wings, combined withnthe sauce, made them difficult to eat; they slipped out of my hand as Intried to eat them, and one of them landed on the floor. A huge disapointment considering that the one menu item that they always hype in their commercials is their chicken wings (\"The official chicken wing of the New York Yankees!).
