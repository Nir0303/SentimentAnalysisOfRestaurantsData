It was cool getting drinks at the historic watering holes of Charleston and getting to be part of a group even though my husband and I were just in town by ourselves. It made for a really fun night out and we continued to bar hop even after the tour was over at 8pm, we saw other members from the group out and about on the town, it was great!

Alan, our guide was informative, fun and a great leader of our group.  I couldn't say one negative thing about this tour EXCEPT our visit into the liquor (ABC) store on the corner of Exchange St and East Bay. Alan was filling us with historical information on that area of the city and telling us the history of the liquor store and said to go inside and take a look if we would like.  My husband and I have been in it a few times and think it's really neat, so I brought the ladies in for them to see for themselves.  Well so much for a warm, southern welcome, the owner was extremely RUDE, told us this was not part of the tour and didn't appreciate it that we were \"browsing\" and he was closing, it was 6:40 pm, the sign said closes at 7pm.  So much for the bottle of wine my cousin was going to buy, we turned around and walked out, but not without him slamming the door on the back of my foot.  I frequent Charleston often, but I will make sure I bring what I am going to drink, this is what I recommend to anyone.  Don't waste your time giving this rude business owner your business, that's right, he is the owner not an employee.  My group felt so bad for Alan, we could see that he was embarrassed.  I'm sure the Charles Towne Pub Stroll guides will never tell their groups to go check out the liquor store anymore......Way to go rude store owner!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "PubStroll, General Manager at The Charles Towne Pub Stroll, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for posting the review.
