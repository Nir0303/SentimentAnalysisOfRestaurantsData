With the show going at 8 PM, all the places recommended to us were booked solid.  We called R.F. O'Sullivan's and asked if we needed reservations - the lady who answered the phone said she was booked but that if we could get there in 30 minutes, she might have a table for us.  We headed out and arrived 45 minutes later, certain that we had lost out - but to our surprise, our table was waiting and we were shown to it immediately - off to a good start.  The staff was friendly, but very very busy, making it hard to place an order.  We eventually ordered drinks and knowing that it takes some time for the food to arrive because each burger is individually prepared, we ordered as soon as we could, mindful of the fact that others were waiting and we needed to be at the auditorium by 7:45.  Although the wait was long, it was well worth it as the burgers were juicy, perfectly cooked, tasty and delicious.  The fries were jewels - crispy, hot and perfectly salted. The restaurant is very small and tables turn over a bit slowly, but the food is just that good to make it a worthwhile stop.
