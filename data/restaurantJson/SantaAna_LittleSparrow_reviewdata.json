It was a Thursday (tonight),the place has a cool atmosphere, had a very nice waitress, a nice bartender, but service was really slow, about 20 minutes to get a water on the table.  There was very little urgency to serve.  Ordered a sea bass and octopus. Both fairly flavorful and unique, well prepared, octopus was tender, neither were very memorable though.  A big problem however, was the dishes were swimming in sauce. No rice or potato or bread to soak up the sauce, just sauce.  As you have read, the portions are made for a little sparrow so that combined with no carb left me and my mom hungry, disappointed and much lighter in the wallet. Also, I love cocktails but there were like 4 drinks with a similar honey lemon ginger theme... So kind of a strangely lopsided drink menu. The drink also, just ok. I had asked for some bread and the waitress said sure but it took so long, we ended up leaving before they brought the bread.  I can only imagine on a weekend how long it might tske to get served.

When I saw a 30% off for LS on Black Board Eats I was surprised, because I don\u2019t think they ever offered a deal in OC before. Still, I was not sure if it was worth a try, but since the options in OC are not that great, finally gave in and tried the Little Sparrow.\nThe setup of the place was the most bizarre of any restaurant I have ever been to. There is a very large coffee house in the front and a much smaller restaurant in the back. That is not the bizarre part though. Their kitchen is in the middle of the coffee house and the restaurant, but their pantries were in two different rooms facing the dining room. As we were sitting waiting for our food to arrive, I saw a parade of kitchen staff going back and forth to these rooms and walking away with all kind of produce. It was just unbelievable. Who came up with this insane setup? Service was OK. Our hostess/waitress was not well informed about the menu and made a mistake with our bill.\nWe had:\nChickpea Masala pomegranate, Yogurt\nIt sounded better than it tasted. The masala spice was there, but a little bit of salt would have done wonders for this dish. If you put yogurt and pomegranate as part of the ingredients, don\u2019t skimp on it specially if you are charging $12 for it.\n\nLamb Merguez Couscous Bowl Harissa, Tzatziki\nI encouraged my husband to try this dish and when we asked our waitress how gamey the lamb was, she responded it is gamey. Guess what? It was not gamey at all. He seemed to enjoy his dish. I took a little bite of the meatball and it was flavorful. The pita crisp looked a little greasy though.\n\nMarinated Hanger Steak Salad Creamy Pepita Dressing, Tortilla Strips\nMy steak was in a desperate need of seasoning which was a shame considering the good quality of the beef. The salty tortilla strips helped to balance the dish. The dressing on the other hand was a little too spicy.\n\nWhen we got the bill we were charged for a hanger steak dinner rather than the salad. I felt the value was not there considering the setup and lack of seasoning and I am glad we didn\u2019t pay the full price. Also after our chickpea starter it took a long time for the rest of the food to arrive considering they were not even busy.\n\nYou can see the pictures at:\ntravel4foodnart", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-10-26T15:09:29-0400", "location_id": "4331470", "id": "322165867", "user": {"username": "lovetobeinparis", "user_location": {"name": "california", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Great Find", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33043-d4331470-r318402046-m11068-Little_Sparrow-Santa_Ana_California.html#review318402046", "text": "Beautiful little Restaurant/CoffeeHouse/Bar\nHeard about it from someone and decided to go for lunch and so happy we did.

Typically, at fine dining restaurants, deep fried dishes are balanced with a light sauce and  some type of micro raw vegetable side for color, contrast, and complexity. The deep fried crab was covered with a heavy batter and served with a cream sauce. When the chicken came to our table, my friend said it looked like chicken nougats from a fast food restaurant. It came to our table with fried nougats piled up, nothing else. I couldn't believe it. The beef was okay. I could have made it better at home. The wine and cocktail was very good.

Which was frisee lettuce, with fresh burrata cheese, roasted squash and pomegranate seeds with a vinaigrette dressing.  Our friends ordered the Escarole Salad and seemed happy with it.\n\nWe ordered our entree's and waited a very reasonable time for them to come out of the kitchen.  The duck breast a top the parsnip risotto was very good, the duck was cooked perfectly.  My Beet, Ricotta Gnocchi was good, but very one note.  The ricotta was a small dollop on top, somewhat disappointing.  The Cod dish was seasoned well, but was lukewarm from the kitchen and the pasta dish was described as good.\n\nI found that some of the problems they had on Best New Restaurant with dishes being inconsistent, still are running a bit true.  \n\nThe service was okay, nothing fantastic for a restaurant wanting to be upscale.  I will tell you that it didn't leave a lasting impression, and doubt we will go back.  The restaurant is very loud, and it is hard to have a conversation when you are with someone special or friends.\n\nWhen I am hearing a lot of buzz about a new restaurant, it is featured on a tv show and the writer for our local restaurant puts it in his top 75 list, I have high expectations.  I really don't feel it is one of the best new restaurants in the OC.\n\nOur salads ran anywhere from $11 to $13 dollars, the least expensive bottle of wine was $45 and the entree's will set you back anywhere from the low $20's to high $30's, which is average for a higher end restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant is located in downtown Santa Ana in a new upcoming area with some great restaurants.  There is paid parking in a parking garage behind the restaurant, street parking will be hard to find.

I went there for Sunday brunch and while the place is quaint with a nice looking bar area, I knew I was in trouble when it took longer than expected to place a drink order. They have bottomless mimosas for a reasonable price which was fine, but I also ordered French press coffee. The waitress made it seem like I didn't know what I was ordering and advised that it was a lot of coffee and I may be better off ordering a cappuccino. I should have listened to her, but instead I asked her to please bring two cups and if needed, I would share my coffee with my guest. Well, she returned with the mimosas, but no coffee. We ordered our meals and waited and waited. The restaurant was not full, so I was not sure why it took so long for French toast that was hard to chew and some cold hash browns. We were half way through the mediocre meal when I finally received my coffee. After pouring it, I brought the cup to my lips and I smelled a peculiar aroma. It smelled like someone had placed vegetable juice in my cup, poured it out, but didn't rinse it out and then poured my coffee in it. I took a sniff from the press and determined the smell was coming from the coffee and not the cup. The coffee tasted terrible. French press should taste strongly of coffee, but this was weak. I would have asked for something else, but no one came to check on us and our cold food and disgusting coffee. The check was also received long after we had finished and was set down without the usual, \"how was everything?\" I suspect it was because she could already tell by our faces. I will give the restaurant one more chance because I heard they have a killer pork chop, but I do not recommend this place to start your beautiful Sunday in So Cal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-03-19T09:34:44-0400", "location_id": "4331470", "id": "260565642", "user": {"username": "Deelite100", "user_location": {"name": "Baldwin Park, California", "id": "32038"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "good food but not a good experience.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33043-d4331470-r260106715-m11068-Little_Sparrow-Santa_Ana_California.html#review260106715", "text": "This place is rated as one of the best new restaurants in Orange County, but a great restaurant experience is more than good food.
