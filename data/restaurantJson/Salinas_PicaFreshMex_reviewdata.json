My friend wanted to check out Pica because she heard/saw good things about it online. Well, let me tell you....we were SOOOO impressed we went back again the next night! The staff is friendly, nice, & welcoming. The chips & salsa are both home-made and DELICIOUS! Our dinners were cooked to perfection & seriously tasted like we were in the heart of Mexico....talk about authenticity! Their prices are VERY reasonable! They even provided a plastic cup w/a lid for my daughter....as a parent, that's HUGE! My only regret....is we weren't staying for a 3rd night!!!  Can't wait to come back to Pica! Enjoy friends!  :)", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-07T20:08:06-0400", "location_id": "2674239", "id": "233207095", "user": {"username": "Stacy D", "user_location": {"name": "Pleasanton, California", "id": "32904"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "My new favorite place EVER!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33002-d2674239-r230020254-m11068-Pica_Fresh_Mex-Salinas_California.html#review230020254", "text": "What can I say, authentic, yummy, great service, great food in downtown area.
