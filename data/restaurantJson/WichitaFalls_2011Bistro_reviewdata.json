While I was glad my son had a place to sit, I can only imagine how upset the table that had the high chair were. When we looked at the table there was absolutely no space for people to actually sit without being on top of each other. We told them we would need to add a table to at least give everyone elbow room, and they acted like it was putting them out to get another one for us and argued for at least 5-10 min before we were accommodated. It took 30 min to get our drinks, they were never refilled, and it took an hr before we ever got our food.

When we did get out food half of it was wrong, but at that point we were just glad to have food, and there's no food a normal kid would want to eat. My daughter, who actually likes normal salads, ordered a side salad but we were not told that it had feta cheese instead of regular cheese that you'd put on a side salad a kid would eat, so she ate nothing.

My choice was fabulous, with thin flatbread toasted with sundried cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, braised lamb, black olives, baby spinach, and tatziki sauce. What a mouthful of sunshine! I'd go back and order this all over again. Try the place. It's only got about 8 tables but the wait staff is friendly and it's full of locals. Don't get in a rush. These items are made to order and perfection takes time.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-16T15:44:17-0400", "location_id": "6956125", "id": "280758112", "user": {"username": "Laurie M", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Worth, Texas", "id": "55857"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "A hole in the wall worth visiting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56891-d6956125-r277972807-m11068-2011_Bistro-Wichita_Falls_Texas.html#review277972807", "text": "My family recently had dinner at 2011 Bistro. This is a typically untypical hole in the wall and worth visiting. Don't expect fancy tables and chairs.  And frankly I'm not sure why they call it a Bistro.  The menu consists mainly of flatbreads, sandwiches, and fries.  Since it was our first time there we all ordered something different and shared.  All the flatbreads were delicious and filling.  The fries were very good and different from other restaurants.  You can expect to pay around $9.00 per person.  There is one odd thing worth mentioning...They charge 50 cents for tap water.  If your looking for some good and different food for lunch take the trip downtown to 2011 Bistro...You won't be disappointed.  Just call before you go for dinner because they are not open every evening.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-04T19:14:52-0400", "location_id": "6956125", "id": "277972807", "user": {"username": "savencash", "user_location": {"name": "Southwest, USA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Tasty Lunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56891-d6956125-r257506513-m11068-2011_Bistro-Wichita_Falls_Texas.html#review257506513", "text": "We all enjoyed our lunch at 2011 Bistro.
