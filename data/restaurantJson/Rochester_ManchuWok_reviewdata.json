The cashier burped loudly after she finished my transaction, she did excuse herself, and I did laugh. Have eaten here many times in the past when I was a meat eater. Chicken is always offered with tasty sauces. However, I only had fried rice crab Rangoon, and egg roll today. The rice is tasty but had some hard chunks and white pieces in it. It makes me wonder if they mix left overs with it or if it the one who prepares it just doesn't care. Egg roll and wontons were crunchy. Mediocre at best without the meat.

I had run to the mall as my ring check-up was overdue and I wanted to just grab some food and spend as little time as possible. \n\nManchu Wok looked like the best option for me (as far as what I was hungry for) so I purchased the 2 item lunch special, and crab rangoons - to go.  \n\nThe crab rangoons were awesome, the food itself was good, but the portions looked much smaller than the people who were ahead of me in line and had chosen to eat there instead of to-go.  \n\nThe cost was around $9.00 so overall it was slightly spendy (and no I did NOT get a drink)...and for the quantity of food given, I thought it was a little expensive. There was plenty of rice - but having diabetes, rice isn't something I'm supposed to eat very much of.  \n\nWill I be back?  Probably.  There really aren't that many choices at the mall anymore, and this seems to be one of the only restaurants that isn't located 20 more times in the city of Rochester.  But it will be awhile - I tend to only visit the food court once or twice per year.  And next time I'll eat there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-03-04T08:11:28-0500", "location_id": "4732705", "id": "257681926", "user": {"username": "newtonianlass", "user_location": {"name": "rochester, minnesota", "id": null}}}]}
