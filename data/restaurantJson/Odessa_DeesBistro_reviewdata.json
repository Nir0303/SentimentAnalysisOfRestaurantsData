They have bread served with tomato, olive mixed with basil for dipping the bread into while you select your meal that is yummy. Randy & Cathy that own the restaurant try to put you at ease right away when you enter their place. This sweet couple serve up wonderful sandwiches for lunch along with very nice salads. They have a different twist on their sandwiches that make them special. Course their Light Creamy Chicken Salad is very good but I also love their Southwest Club that has smoked ham, turkey, avocado & smoked Gouda cheese. They top this with Chipotle sauce like spread. Yummy!!!\n  When I want just veggies for a dish but not a salad I love ordering their Grilled Portabella which is a large mushroom that's been marinated , grilled & then filled with lettuce, tomato, & topped with a cream spread with capers in it! Warning, this dish seems to be a favorite of others cause they do sometimes sell out of them. \n   They serve sweet potato fries with a lot of their lunch plates. These are more like straw than fries because of them being so thin. But they serve them with a sweet sauce & together it is one of the best things they make there. I just love them!!! Very good!!!\n   Something that the Bistro Grill has started doing the last few months is being open on Friday nights. They serve a different fare on evenings with steak & chicken or fish dishes. We love their fried green beans served with dill sauce! My husband & I could make that a meal just on those! They are so very good!! \n  They also serve a wonderful beef medallions with a red wine reduction sauce over it!!! Oh boy is that good! Makes me hungry just talking on this site about their food!! \n   They also have now & then dinner & play nights where there will be a play performed while you eat. In the back part of the restaurant is a small stage for this & for other performers to come & play guitars, keyboards & other instruments. You never know what you'll find there. Many times they have either instructors of music from the near by colleges near by or their students who are pretty good themselves. \n  If you've never tried Dee's Bistro Grill then I suggest you do! You most likely will agree with me it is a very nice place to eat & visit. It's on the corner of Lee & 7th street where the old Presidental Museum use to be. If you go to the Bapitist Church in Down town Odessa, it is right across the street from there, ( to give a reference point). Hope you give this Christian couple's restaurant a try! You'll be glade you did.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-02-24T16:03:00-0500", "location_id": "3893213", "id": "152996417", "user": {"username": "Edna K", "user_location": {"name": "Odessa, Texas", "id": "56385"}}}]}
