The hotel staff were absolutely great, couldn't do enough.  The room was nothing to write home about, just about the same as any hotel in the category...some of the fixtures were a little worn...the bathroom door would not clear the bath mat when swinging...little details that are overlooked.  The breakfast each morning was buffet style, hot was hot and cold cold!  Fruit tray excellent, muffins and breads VG...hot meat sausage and bacon done right and hot...eggs scrambled.  The staff in the morning was attentive and prompt.  The coffee was hot and plentiful, choice of tea and there was OJ and water as well.  Only detail was no place to deposit the empty Hand H cream cup, sugar packet and used stir stick.  The meeting rooms were large and served our purposes well.  We were on our own for dinner so one night we decided to try the in hotel facility on the top floor.  It is not worth the price even with the discount we got for being long term guests.   The server was too diner-ish and not really suitable to the atmosphere portrayed, which wasn't much.   The food was adequate to not acceptable...no bread basket even when asked were told we ran out of bread.  That should have been a clue that my French onion soup would not be right...I was right, it was hot and i was hungry...my pork was OK but my Dad's salmon was under-cooked and raw for about 2/3 of the piece...the veg was soft and not tasty...don't eat there.  Go to the Spag Warehouse a block away.  Each day we were busy and away from the hotle except for Sunday when we used an upper floor small room for a gathering.   It was a good room and set up well.  Then came the finale, the banquet on Sunday evening.  The large room was set up well, standard round 8 top tables and display tables along one wall and speakers stand up front...all normal stuff.  BUT I noticed there were no bread plates or butter dishes yet there was a fork across the top of the place setting...hummm!!!  Things moved along and the festivities finished and it was time for food...out came the entree...no salad, no bread...when asked the server brought two salads for the people that were asking at our table...which I thought it was asked for the entire table...earlier there had been placed a gravy boat with a white looking sauce in it...I figured it was ranch for the salad and I would need to ask for 1000.  So the folks with salads tried to pour the sauce out, it did not move it was like plaster...one of the ladies dipped a fork in and tasted it...horseradish for the prime-rib...gheeezzzz!!!  Still no bread or butter!!!  The servers had no clue it looked like they were brought in for the night had white gloves and shirts plus black pants handed to them and instructed to go...no responses and even had to ask for water refills...there should be a couple of servers for a large group doing just water all the time. After a while we were all laughing at the ridiculous situation and what a disaster it is.  Then I said I bet the dessert is cheesecake with a pink drizzle that is supposed to taste like strawberries...I took the prize and our table burst out in laughter when it showed up...the other tables  wondered what fun we were having.   The food at the banquet was not done well and predictable and unpredictable as you can see.  I was thinking at least breakfast will fill the void from this evenings poor showing.  (A side note:  I may be a bit too fussy, you see I work in the hospitality industry...I am a Captain on tour/dinner vessels in Seattle, our chefs are excellent and they ask for my opinion on new dishes...so I speak with authority..plus my daughter is a chef, they were not winning any points at this banquet!)  This is the worst banquet I have seen or experienced.  \nThe next morning as i expected the breakfast was good and presented well as it had each morning and the again the staff wonderful.   \nThe parking staff/shuttle drivers were fantastic fun and friendly.  I arrived in my 26' truck camper and they provided a spot for me to park the entire long weekend.\n\nOne thing I do have to mention as it is usually a failure at most hotels, the ice machine on my floor WORKED and was abundant...AMAZING!\n\nOver all the hotel is OK the staff very good.  All elevators worked.  On Saturday night the jazz band in the upper lounge was good and the service at the bar good.  Prices are not out of line for refreshment.\n\nIt is sad that the ending really set my impression.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Mark_CPDayton, Manager at Crowne Plaza Dayton, responded to this review", "text": "Dear CaptPJ,\n\nThank you for your big review on the Crowne Plaza Dayton.

She was fantastic and a joy to work with. Based on my experience with her, I expected much higher expectations from that the hotel did not meet. \n\nAs my bridal party arrived, we noticed that the parking was valet only, which is perfectly acceptable. However, the valets were not in uniform on and in fact, were wearing track suits with Cincinnati Reds logos. It is very disconcerting to be expected to hand over your car to a person who seemingly has no affiliation with your hotel. \n\nI did not feel safe handing keys over and ended up parking much farther away and had to carry all of my bridal things. \n\nUpon arriving to the hotel, the elevator did not work and continuously got stuck on floors. We ended up getting out on the fifth floor and taking the stairs to the 9th floor only to find out I could get through the door which meant we had to take the stairs back down to the 8th floor and hope the elevator would get us to our floor. \n\nHaving to carry luggage for 6, along with my photographer, his assistant, and my wedding dress up multiple flights of stairs was ridiculous. \n\nWe then found out that you need to insert a key card into the elevator in order to get to the 9th floor. This would be reasonable  if it was for suites only, but that was not the case as there were standard rooms on the floor as well. It was also not explained to us by the receptionist at check which led to confusion.\n\nThe plan was to get ready with my bridesmaids in our my suite. However, due to the key card issue, one of us had to go down to the lobby to bring people to our room. That with the elevator issues took nearly 15-20 minutes to get people up to my room. I assumed there had to be a solution to this problem. After all, I can't be the only person who\u2019s run into this problem. I called down to the lobby and the following conversation took place. (I will me \"M\", the Lobby will be \"L\")\n\nM: Hello, I'm staying here for my wedding with a bridal party and will have people coming and going for a few hours as we get ready for the event. It appears that it is quite difficult for people to come and go due to needing a key card for the elevator. Do you have a solution for me?\nL: No\nM: (taken aback) There is absolutely nothing you can do for me? \nL: No \nM: How is that possible?\nL: (with an attitude) Well, I guess I can just hand a room key to anyone requesting access to your room?\nM: That would be great, just have them request my name and room number\n\nThe next interaction I had with the front desk was even worse. I will preface this with the fact that .I am an account executive for a large marketing and advertising company. I have years of customer service experience. So I am quite reasonable when working with those in a similar profession. \n\nWe found that the tap water in our hotel was unpalatable. Now, I understand that The Crowne plaza is an older hotel and those things can happen so I figured I could have bottled water brought to my room. \n\nM: Hello, may I please have some bottled water brought to my room?\nL: No \nM: You guys don't have any bottled water available for guests? I find that odd. \nL: (seemingly aggravated) Well, I guess I can try. Let me transfer you. \n\n(transfers the call)\n\nL: Hello (no name, or other greeting) \nM: Hello, may I please have bottled water brought to room 913?\nL: Absolutely not \nM: Excuse me? \nL: (with attitude) This is the sales department, why would you call me and ask me to bring you water?\nM: I was transferred to you.\nL: Why on earth would I bring you water?\nM: Again, I was transferred to you, I didn't call you directly. Perhaps you could transfer me to the appropriate department. \nL: Fine (transfers the call)\n\nAfter another transfer, I was able to get my request to the right person. But it would appear that I was asking for something utterly unusual and ridiculous for the attitude and response I received from every staff member I spoke to. \n\nAlso, it was $5/bottle. But, I can get past that. \n\nI assume your calls are recorded. I must insist you listen to them as I've done some paraphrasing. You will find that my memory is quite accurate. \n\nThe room itself was set up in an odd manner. It seemed to be more of an executive style suite with a large conference table then one suited for a bride and groom. However, that's not much of a big deal.  \n\nAfter returning to the hotel after our wedding and reception. We noticed that there was a filthy luggage trolley riding the elevator on its own. \n\nOther observations include: \n-no coffee shelf in the coffee maker; thus, we couldn't make coffee\n-there were no bedside tables next to our bed \n-no alarm clock in the room\n-curtains in our room were flimsy see-through which made it impossible to sleep in. \n-None of the room key cards worked for our guests when we got back from the wedding reception. We had to be brought up by security. \n-Charged $100 more than what was quoted. I was told I would receive a discount due to reserving a block of rooms.\n-Room was hot and smelled like burning dust when we first got in\n\nI could get past the issues typical with an older hotel i.e., elevators, gross water, and etc. I can see that it would probably be fine if you were staying for business. However, I would not personally recommend the Crowne Plaza Dayton under any circumstances for any special event and especially not a wedding. \n\nThe customer service was utterly reprehensible.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Mark_CPDayton, Manager at Crowne Plaza Dayton, responded to this review", "text": "Dear drdana16,\n\nThank you for your review on the Crowne Plaza Dayton.
