I have lived here a long time and never knew there was a postal museum in this old post office. I had also never been inside the post office. This is like walking back in time from the time you open the main door. All of the boxes are the old style boxes. The postal museum is inside the main lobby and has limited hours of operation. The museum is open 11:30 until 3:30 Monday through Friday. It's free and well worth the visit just to see all of the history. As soon as you walk in the door, you feel like you've stepped back in time. There is an old phone, typewriter and mail box. The old postal window is set up just as it would have been many years ago. The history of the post office box is posted next to a replica of the boxes. The post office still uses these style boxes. There is plenty of interesting reading around the room including the history of the Charleston Post office. You can spend time reading all of them. It's a very cool place to visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-12T11:18:57-0400", "location_id": "4097457", "id": "417577904", "user": {"username": "Terrie J", "user_location": {"name": "Charleston, South Carolina", "id": "54171"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great insight into the importance of Postal Delivery", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54171-d4097457-r404637578-m11068-Postal_Museum-Charleston_South_Carolina.html#review404637578", "text": "This museum was filled with lots of artifacts and reproductions that give you great insight into the importance of a functioning post office.
