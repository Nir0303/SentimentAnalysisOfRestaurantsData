So happened to be in the area a couple of times in the past month and tried lunch on a Saturday and breakfast a couple of weeks later on Sunday,  Both visits were good with great service. They missed my initial request for coffee and when they checked and found out I hadn't got started --it never got down an inch before it was topped off for the rest of the visit.\nSteak sandwich was a little fatty --so I would order more med-well next time.  Home made onion rings were fresh and HOT- be careful.\nBreakfast special omelet --tri-tip --was loaded with onions and peppers --so if you don't like them ( or have an allergy like my partner)  leave that one in the kitchen.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-28T11:02:49-0400", "location_id": "3134822", "id": "262296266", "user": {"username": "Slough B", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Fun and full", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32980-d3134822-r237826171-m11068-Granite_Rock_Grill-Rocklin_California.html#review237826171", "text": "A really fun place to go for breakfast with a large group.
