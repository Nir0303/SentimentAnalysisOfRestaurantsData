Find a better place to stay.We stayed here for my son's wedding because it was at the convention center that was attached to the hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. We park in the ramp because there's a sky walk to the hotel. Starts pretty good. The first two doors have the buttons to push for opening the doors. Get to the next three and the doors need to be held open which isn't easy when you're trying to get a wheelchair through. Get to the room and their idea of a handicap bathroom is to set a shower seat in the tub. My husband can barely pick his feet up much less try to get into a tub to shower. Needs some serious attention. We are trying to relax a bit when we hear a key going in the door, figured maybe it was the maid. It is my daughter, as they have assigned her our room also. They were to have the room next door. Their room also had serious issues. The heat exchanger wouldn't shut off, it was either too hot or too cold. The mattress also sucked in their room.Talked to some of the wedding party and one couple had to get a third room to find one that was acceptable the first two were dirty. Another couple found a used band aid on the floor of the bathroom. The rooms are also very dark in appearance. The TV remote wouldn't change the channels, had to hand input the channels, had to search for a channel directory, which was inside a book, in a drawer. Came back from the wedding and the room hadn't even been cleaned, had to go to the front desk to get coffee for morning and fresh towels  Asked for a comment card at the desk when I checked out and they didn't have any and was told there were some in the room.

When we got there it seem like a normal hotel; a little outdated but no big deal.\n\nWe checked in, went upstairs get in our room and the only ceiling light except the bathroom doesn't work...ok. That's dumb but liveable, so we try to use the phone to call down stairs...phone is dead...alright we need a new room we decide.Back downstairs we go with our belongings. \n\nMy fiance asks if we can get a different room and to see if we could up-grade for no additional charge. The front desk gentleman finds us a new room and gives us a suite and we go back upstairs.\n\nOur new room was bigger it had a living space and bedroom but even with all the lights on it was dark...no big deal at least all the lights turned on...great...After we came back from our concert around 11:30-12 it all went down hill from there.\n\nAs we came back suddenly the hallway lights started to dim and flutter. It was unnerving but...ok. Then back in our room same thing with our lights, but now it was impossible to see in the bathroom without using the flash light on my phone.\n\nWe sit down in the living space, and watch some t.v..I decide to get ice. The hallway is now pitch black except for where the elevators are, so I go back into my room.\n\nI try to call downstairs to let them know...phone is dead. Ok, no big deal...I try to use the restroom again, with the aid of my cell phone...wash my hands and the waters out...great! No one contacted us, or told us what was going on...things just kept getting worse.\n\nMy fiance tries to convince me we should just go to bed, we can talk to them in the morning. I try to get into bed...my side is damp and the floor is wet under my feet. It's so wet you can hear water squwish under your toes. \"I am not sleeping in there\" so, through the pitch black hallway and down the now questionable elevator I go.\n\nWhen the doors open I see a front desk women and some guys she says are from mid America. \"our basement is flooding\" she says...I told her my problems with the phone, the water being turned off and the lights and finished with the water on the floor and bed. \n\nShe's says we are on back up generators and the bed must be wet from the a/c unit getting hot, cold, hot cold. She offers to have us change rooms. I decline because it 1am and this our second room. Tell the front desk tomorrow she says, I am sure they will work something out with you.\n\nBack upstairs I go, up in the now very questionable elevator and through the creepy black hall way to my room. I explain everything to my fiance about my conversation and we decide to sleep on the pull out couch in the living room because atleast it was dry. \n\nAs we crawl into this ragged, small pull out bed, wishing we had just stayed with our first room, with our DRY king size bed the power finally goes out. \n\nThat pull out was more uncomfortable, lumpy, and jagged then my aunts couch at Chistmas...and I stay there for free. Also who knows when those sheets were cleaned, but it was our only option so we tried to sleep.\n\nWe woke up still with no water, power, or phone and we were misrable and shore from our tiny pull out bed. We exited the room the hallway was still black, except for the light coming in through the windows near the elevator.\n\nDown the very questionable elevator to the lobby we go to check out. We are greeted with \"How was your stay?\"...\"how was my Stay!!??\"...really as if this was normal!!??? This was by far one of the worst hotel experience except for a La Quinta in KC that we thought had bedbugs and she asks \"how was my stay\"???!!\n\nI get that basements flood... Its Iowa..it happens. If this happened at my families house I would at least get a good apology but no. \"Sorry to hear that\" after I gave her my list of terrible things that happened to us last night. I told her about the water on the floor and she says \"thanks will take a look at it\"...like this is normal.I tell her we had a horrible nights sleep on our jagged little pull out and I get an \"oh sorry.\"\n\nAnd to top it all off power is out so she can't check me out. She writes down my email and name, says she will send out an email receipt with the bill in a few days and they will look at discounting my rate. Great, I thought atleast we get that.\n\nToday I check my credit card statement because for a week and a half I have seen nothing on my bill. I think great they gave us the night free for our troubles...no!!! they charged me in full for a horrible hotel expierence with the same amenities as summer camp.\n\nI would even except a discount but not full price. What an outrages, horrible place out horror novel. Just the worst...don't waste your time or money ever on this place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-18T15:45:44-0400", "location_id": "92042", "id": "429492852", "user": {"username": "Justine Y", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Bare minimum", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38500-d92042-r429464476-m11068-Ramada_Waterloo_Hotel_and_Convention_Center-Waterloo_Iowa.html#review429464476", "text": "The room was clean and the people were friendly and helpful.

One told me it was because of the flood, another said it was regular scheduled maintenance.\n-One staff (probably a custodian) told me the pool was closed and out of order (not true).  \n-The manager was nowhere to be found the entire weekend. There was a fairly large event occurring throughout the weekend and was surprised at the lack of hotel administration presence.\n-Two of three elevators were broke for at least one whole day/night and one elevator was out of order the entire time. The guests had to put of the signs on the elevators, because apparently the front desk did not understand the impact it would have on the guest.\n-When the two guest elevators down, I asked if we could use another (early in the morning) and I was told that is only for staff!
