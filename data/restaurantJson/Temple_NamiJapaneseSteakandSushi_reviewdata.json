So if you ever visit, ask to meet him and he will give you the 5 star treatment :) We received that that night when he happened to be there. He had the sushi chef prepare a crab salad and it was delicious. Very filling with lots of crabmeat. We ordered an eel rool and a rock and roll roll and they were huge! These could be the meals in itself but I love katsu so I got the pork katsu. It wasn't bad at all. The chicken yakisoba my daughter got was delicious! Way better. I can tell that their hibachi would be great based on this yakisoba! Suffice to say we were stuffed but we had to try their specialty dessert which was the cheesecake roll. Ok have to admit this was too funky for me but my daughter and my husband (when we brought some home) liked it a lot. It was soo filling and very unique. YOu just have to try it yourself. You can tell many local keep coming back here based on the reception. We wish we lived nearer to we can frequent here more but its a cute little place-inside is dark and way bigger than it looks from the outside. Its a little hole in the wall in smack of small Temple downtown but I can tell its well-known. Definitely so glad we go to try this since it was on our way home. I would love to have more noodle and sushi dishes next time aroun definitely. I am still thinking about their veggies-they are so fresh and crunchy.

It's never very crowded in the main (non-hibachi) dining area. At least one day a week they run sushi specials, but it's changed a few times so I would recommend calling to confirm the day(s)/timeof their sushi happy hour. I always get sushi rolls and my husband always gets hibachi - we have been pleased everytime!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-06-18T14:00:41-0400", "location_id": "4947284", "id": "210990292", "user": {"username": "JaneCHD", "user_location": {"name": "Temple, Texas", "id": "56754"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Family Favorite", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56754-d4947284-r207368011-m11068-Nami_Japanese_Steak_and_Sushi-Temple_Texas.html#review207368011", "text": "My family and I love Nami's. The atmosphere is fun and energetic without being loud and chaotic. When we go, we typically take our kids (ages 7 and 10) and have been for years. It is definitely something the whole family can enjoy. We always eat at the Habachi grill and it is usually the reason we love it so much. Most of the Habachi cooks are very animated and are great with kids. We also occasionally go with friends from work. Their dinner portions are very generous. We usually leave with tons of left overs to eat the next day. Lunch portions are just right... enough to leave you stuffed (usually no leftovers) but at a cheaper price.
