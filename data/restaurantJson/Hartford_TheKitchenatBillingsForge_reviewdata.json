The notable thing about Billings Forge is that so many items have a wonderful little twist that take them above the ordinary.  The chicken salad sandwich came on a cranberry walnut bread that added extra wonderful (and harmonious) flavors.  The potato salad had a little horseradish in it that made it really crave-able.  The apricot bar had an intriguing little bit of rosemary.  Though the restaurant is small, there are a couple of communal tables that will fit you in if the regular tables are full.  Parking isn't always available in the lot in front of the caf\u00e9, but there is adequate street parking.
