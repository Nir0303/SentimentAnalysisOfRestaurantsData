Our town is in need of a nice place like this to meet, hang out, or meet for a business lunch or dinner.\n\nI decided to order the Bomb Gin. It was sooooo good! My girlfriend ordered a Manhattan. The bartender told us they were out of Maker's Mark, and they recommended a great alternative: Bulleit Rye. Fantastic!\n\nAs for our food, we shared a green salad, mini-chicken pot pie, and sirloin steak with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus...a.k.a The Paleo Plate. It is all home made and delicious! The steak was cooked to perfection and everything paired well with our tasty drinks.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!

It is a cute, modern, take on traditional comfort food.  My girlfriends and I shared several of the \"Happytizers\".  All of them were delicious, but I strongly recommend the deviled eggs, fried green beans, and brussels sprouts.  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about ordering deviled eggs at a restaurant, but they are incredible!  The perfect texture and  taste!  Normally, I find the mayo in deviled eggs overpowering, but not in Happy  Hour's eggs.  The breading on the green beans was just right.  It was crisp, flavorful and not soggy at all.  As for the brussels sprouts, we were fighting over who got the last one.  \n\nThe cocktails were all delicious!  The bartender clearly knows how to mix a drink.  We each tried several of the cocktails.  I loved the Happy Hibiscus and the Gimlet.  They also have a great selection of Mocktails for your designated driver.  I tried the \"Yup!\" and it was so yummy!  Next time I visit Happy Hour, I'm ordering it with vodka.  \n\nI will definitely be back to Happy Hour!
