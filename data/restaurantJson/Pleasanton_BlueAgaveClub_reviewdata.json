Based on other TripAdvisor reviews, we chose to visit Blue Agave Club, and give it a try. \n\nWe thought that the service was excellent. We received a complementary basket of housemade chips with three salsas, and iced water. Water glasses were filled regularly, and an offer of a chip refill was made before we had run out. When we were both done with lunch, plates were cleared promptly. You felt well taken care of.\n\nThe outdoor patio is a very pleasant place to eat. I can imagine that on a warm evening, with the decorative lights on, that it becomes an even more pleasant place to dine. Table separation is adequate. Music is played at a volume that helps mask the sound of passing cars on Main Street, but does not interfere with conversation at the table. If I were out in Pleasanton on a warm summer or fall night I would definitely check it out. \n\nWe ordered two of the regional plates. My wife opted for the chicken mole, and I had the carnitas plate. Both came with rice, mine came with black beans and various sides (onions, lettuce, sour cream, tomato, and a guacamole puree). You had your choice of corn or flour tortillas, which came warmed in a basket. The portions of pork and chicken were substantial. My wife liked the mole itself; she said it had good flavor. I similarly liked the shredded pork; the fat was fully rendered, and it had good flavor. We both felt that the meats were a bit dried out. For the pork there is the issue of fully rendering the fat, but once the fat is rendered, even a pork shoulder will eventually dry out. What was billed as having been cooked for 24 hours might actually have been a bit better if it had only been cooked a bit less. I did not consider this a terribly serious flaw, but I prefer pork a little moister and more unctuous. The matter of chicken is a bit different. Breast meat tends to be less fatty and thus dries out much more easily. If there had been more mole, than perhaps it would not have been as much of an issue, but just looking at the cut surfaces of the chicken, there was no juice flowing. It even looked dry across the table. So that dish could have been better, but we were not willing to send it back or have the item recooked. Perhaps we got unlucky on that choice. \n\nOverall, I like the restaurant. Again, the service was attentive and professional. The seating area is pleasant, and would have been even more pleasant had we dined on a slightly warmer day. I was happy to see that there were salt and pepper shakers on the tables. I did not need either for the dishes we ordered, but I dislike restaurants that now make you ask for salt and pepper. I worry that soon I will need to bring my own cutlery or ask for a fork. The food was good to very good. There was no dish that I would drive 35 miles each way to sample again, and because of the drive I would be quite restrained in sampling tequilas. I enjoyed the salsa medley, but we are fortunate to have a nearby restaurant with roughly twenty salsas in their salsa bar. I suspect that I can find good mole more locally as well. The value was average to good. Our lunch tab for two with the tip but without any drinks came to around $50. So if you are staying in or near Pleasanton, and want a Mexican meal with excellent service in pleasant surroundings, I will certainly recommend Blue Agave Club. If I could walk to a hotel, I might really enjoy the tequila selection. For us, I don\u2019t think we would drive all the way to Pleasanton just to dine there. That should not be interpreted as a slight, it is just a matter of having many wonderful options substantially closer to home that avoid a 50-minute drive each way even when traffic is light.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-14T07:46:17-0400", "location_id": "377666", "id": "418472973", "user": {"username": "Andreas G", "user_location": {"name": "Berkeley, California", "id": "32066"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Not your regular tacos and nachos mexican restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32904-d377666-r418362930-m11068-Blue_Agave_Club-Pleasanton_California.html#review418362930", "text": "I love Mexican food but this place has more than the regular burritos and tacos.

One happy place we saw was Blue Agave Club right in the heart of downtown Pleasanton. Since the fair was going on at that time, you just cant help but jive with the festive air around. We found this really happy and lively setting that Blue Agave have and we were instantly drawn to the atmosphere. The place was booked. We came and were told that we have to wait for awhile but managed to sit us in less than 10 minute wait. The waiters/ staff were friendly and the chips and salsa were exceptional. They put 3 types of salsa and we loved them all. We were also satisfied with the main dish we ordered. \nBottomline, we will definitely come back to try other dishes", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-22T11:47:40-0400", "location_id": "377666", "id": "395564403", "user": {"username": "Geldelrey07", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, CA", "id": null}}}]}
