Frankly, I hadn't really noticed it when looking for ways to spend a morning - my daughter's boyfriend suggested stopping by because it sounded interesting. Not being from the area, I had no preconceptions about what it might hold. \n\nThe museum is a relatively small place next to the library. Street parking was easy to find if you want to go but it's cheaper to park in the adjacent parking facility.\n\nThe staff is really friendly - although on the day we went the person who greeted us seemed sort of surprised to see us come in. It wasn't very busy but I think that is to be expected for most small historical museums and societies. The space is small but set up nicely. There is plenty of room to move about from gallery to gallery. The permanent exhibits do a very nice job of showcasing early Santa Monica and were interesting to spend some time over. Something that was surprising was a mention of the early segregated beach facilities that existed. Many local museums tend to overlook such things - it was nice to see that this period of time wasn't neglected.\n\nThis month they had an informative exhibit on the history of the Soldier's Home (now the VA facility). There were a lot of old photographs and displays that were really interesting to look at.\n\nI have to admit that one of our favorite exhibits was the one of the Douglas manufacturing plant - specifically a letter written by a young woman working there during the WWII years. For those who don't take the time to read such things you are missing out. It was a pretty funny, open and honest letter that made us laugh at her descriptions of some people she was working with.\n\nFor those doing research, there looks to be a pretty decent library of local history works as well and a bright and open work space.\n\nThis is a small museum, yes, and doesn't take up a lot of your time, but it's a nice way to spend an hour.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-10-23T09:39:49-0400", "location_id": "4293397", "id": "430934010", "user": {"username": "hounddog62", "user_location": {"name": "Monroe, Connecticut", "id": "33840"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "What a find", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33052-d4293397-r420883580-m11068-Santa_Monica_History_Museum-Santa_Monica_California.html#review420883580", "text": "Small tucked behind the Santa Monica Library.
