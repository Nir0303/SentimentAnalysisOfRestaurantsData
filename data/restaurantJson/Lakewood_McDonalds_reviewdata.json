The french fries are the best in the world as long as you eat them in the 10 minute window of french fry magic. This eatery is no different than any other and that's why we like the place. Fries have been cooking at this location as far back as the 60's. It was my go to place in high school and remains so almost 50 years later. The new all day breakfast is the smartest thing McDonald's has done since the french fry hit the oil. Give it a go!!
