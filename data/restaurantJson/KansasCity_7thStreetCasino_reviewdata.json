I collect table chips, so when ever I see a casino while traveling, I stop in. And this one was near the bottom of the list of casino experiences. First, it is in a bad part of town, and we were not comfortable being in the area. And parking was tough. But we went inside anyway. The folks at the door were super nice and inviting. And that is the good parts of the review. We were hoping for tables, but this is a slots only casino. No bar, no food, but there was a free soft drink area (but your not allowed to take the drinks outside).  The rooms were dingy and old, carpet dirty and the clientele appeared local and looked shaky, just like the surrounding neighborhood. There are multiple floors with small rooms of slots machines. It was not clean or comfortable and there are no amenities besides the opportunity to play slots. The 5 of us each decided to play a little. I put a $20 bill in my machine and had ZERO payouts. Not even a cherry... My friends each had similar experiences. Seems the payout rate here is low.

I found it mildly interesting, but not nearly as interesting as a \"real casino.\" All there are here are slot machines of various types, many of which involve card \"playing.\" If you're into that, they do have a nice variety of games. I don't recall drink prices now, but do remember they seemed reasonable. The machines seemed to pay out pretty well, as my friend on that day and other days, actually managed to win sizeable amounts (which he ended up giving back).  Compared to a real casino in Vegas, or even a Missouri River boat one offering table games, this place is a joke.

A different special is offered every day for the same price. The food was very good and a good size portion. Can't beat it.\nParking is in any of the city parking lots and a Casino Shuttle carries you to the entrance and returns you to your car.
