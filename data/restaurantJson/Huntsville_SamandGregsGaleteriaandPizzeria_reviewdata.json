Once at the table you wait for your box to vibrate...often it doesn't and someone finally brings your pizza to the table BUT don't ever put the vibrating box on the can in the middle of the table because they will let you know that's wrong. We would buy more beer IF someone would come around to take the order and bring it to the table...but getting back in line to get more drinks is painful when they are busy...so we don't.
