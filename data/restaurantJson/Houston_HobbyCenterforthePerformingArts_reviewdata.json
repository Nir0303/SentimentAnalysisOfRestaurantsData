The script had the whole audience laughing out loud. The \"Wicked Witch\" had such a droll personality and humor. It reminded me of the old stand up comics that had always had the \"deadpanning\" side kick. Glinda's character was done so well. I grew to loathe her in many scenes reminiscent of stereotypical  popular cheerleaders and the games they played but she redeemed herself before the end. The storyline seamlessly incorporated the beloved characters from the original Oz and I squealed audibly with delight to see how the cast did that. Finally, the singing. Ah! The glorious singing.

The line to get in was not bad at all and there was no wait. There are a large amount of stair in the building and you must climb them to the level to enter the theatre and to go down to the restrooms. The biggest problem that I have with the theater itself is that the seats are not staggered. I had the pleasure of sitting behind a giant man and couldn't see sound his head and shoulders.  If the seats had been staggered this would not happen to anyone. Luckily I was sitting between my younger sister and a great friend so I was able to lean to the side to be able to see the show that I paid $120 for my seat. The other thing is that drinks from the bar are expansive and the lines are LONG! Long, long, long. For a water or soda it is $3, for a cup to enter the theatre with is an additional $3 to any drink. A double alcoholic drink is $20. There is a food station set up that had made to order pasta, salads, sandwiches and chips. And, the food was good but costly. Make sure you get yourself in a seat that you can't get stuck behind a giant and you'll have a great time.
