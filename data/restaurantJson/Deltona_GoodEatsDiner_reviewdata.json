We stopped in one day for breakfast on our way to Disney. The first thing we are greeted by is a sign on the door that they don't accept cards. Great. Hubby walked over to Wells Fargo and got hammered in ATM fees to get cash so we could try this delicious restaurant.\n\nThere were a lot of regulars in the place and our server was talking to all of them. But, short with us. It was \"what would you like to drink\" and \"are you ready to order\" and not even with a smile, guess we were taking her away from her conversations with the people who somehow managed to get to know her. \n\nThe menu was not very big, it's very basic when it comes to offerings. But, we placed an order. It didn't take long for the food to come out, but when she brought it to the table she really just dumped it and left, guess we were interfering with her conversation again by ordering our meal. I had to flag her down to get condiments. And a refill never came. \n\nLater I started wondering if the server may have been the owner, she ended up digging into a pile of cash to make some change. \n\nI hope the regulars don't die or move away because they aren't doing anything to gain new customers.
