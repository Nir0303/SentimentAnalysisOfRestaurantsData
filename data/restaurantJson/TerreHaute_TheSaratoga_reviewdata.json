It is a classic gem in downtown Terre Haute, IN, and it has a wonderful atmosphere and menu. I had been here twice before, once with my wife and her sister\u2019s family, and once following my son\u2019s graduation from Rose-Hulman. The food has always been superb. This time we had two appetizers: their hummus plate and their Asian/wasabi calamari. They were very well prepared and tasty. We also had a wonderfully sweet red wine with our meal. The entr\u00e9e that my wife selected was their evening special for that night, chicken marinara with feta cheese. I had their Mediterranean shrimp, made with rosemary and parsley mixed in with feta cheese and olive oil. It had a wonderful flavor. My only issue with the dish was the small number of shrimp that I received; but as they were large shrimp, it really didn\u2019t matter. My Caesar salad was wonderful, as was my potato dish, which is called lyonnaise potatoes, and is a mixture of fried potatoes and onions. We finished our meal with dessert; my wife had their chocolate cake, and I had their coconut cream pie. Their prices are very reasonable; each of us had an appetizer, entr\u00e9e, dessert, and coffee, and we shared a bottle of wine, all for less than $40 per person. I would recommend any item on the menu; their specialties are their steak and prime menu, along with their Mediterranean dishes. I\u2019ve never had any of their breakfast items, but I am confident that they would be delicious as well.
