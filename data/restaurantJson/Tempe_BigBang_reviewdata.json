Firstly, this is not a restaurant.  We were there on a Friday night and there was no food at all.  Drinks are served in thin plastic cups.  One would think that being so close to ASU that it would be a student hang out.  It doesn't appear to be that.  The night we went, there were very few students and the average age was between 30 and 60.  The entertainers are very talented.  I think it's the luck of the draw as to whether or not the group you get does a nice job or not.  Our entertainers were a bit rowdy and some things were inappropriate.  It wasn't like a normal bar where people hang out, drink and talk.  This appears to be a bar where people drink way too much in order to get up enough nerve to participate in the entertainment.  It's LOUD; even the dual pianos are amplified.
