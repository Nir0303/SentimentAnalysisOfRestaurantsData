It's been cold and not wanting to cook, I decided it was pizza tonight. So tired of Pizza Hut and Domino's and needed something different and came on tripadviser to check places. Looked at menus and decided to give this place a shot. Can't beat the price! $6.99 for a large one topping pizza and we decided on buffalo wings as well. I've never seen $12.99 for 20 wings. I was highly skeptical but figured what the hell? Beats Little Ceaser's ANY day. Pizza was great (I opted for 2 specials which was $9.99 each) and 20 wings, fed my family of 5 and we were all happy. They don't deliver but that's ok, it was worth the pick up. Staff was friendly, even when a not so friendly customer came in, it's not a sit down and eat kind of place, more of an order and go. Parking really kind of stinks, but will be ordering again. I also noticed catering deals which were very nicely priced, which will come in handy for me", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-02-18T18:21:41-0500", "location_id": "7347509", "id": "255131822", "user": {"username": "Christina R", "user_location": {"name": "Morris, Illinois", "id": "36392"}}}]}
