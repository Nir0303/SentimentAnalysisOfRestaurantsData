We saw a great production of \"Hedda Gabler\" - some really fine acting and the staff was so incredibly warm and inviting. I really liked that there were \"free\" refreshments working with a donation vs. charging $10 for a candy bar, at some places! The production budget was small but really it was a worthwhile performance and I highly recommend a visit!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-04T16:43:02-0500", "location_id": "8390906", "id": "352980034", "user": {"username": "Wendy S", "user_location": {"name": "Rockaway, New Jersey", "id": "46783"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Young Frankstein the musical", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49136-d8390906-r316427520-m11068-Gilbert_Theater-Fayetteville_North_Carolina.html#review316427520", "text": "This was our second visit to the Gilbert and we had the best time.

The restrooms are in the childrens play area. Being new to plays we are amazed at all they could do with a few simple pieces of furniture  The backdrops were very cool and set the mood.
