Place is kinda dirty.

He was looking at the kid, in a totally different direction than where I was, and in mid sentence to the kid he says, can I help you?\nI hear him but can't imagine why he wouldn't look at the person he is addressing.  After a four or five second pause, while he is still looking at the kid, I said, are you talking to me?\nHe says no, I'm talking to the guy who came in behind you!  There was nobody behind me.\nI said that in this country, people who speak English normally look at the person they are speaking to unless they are ignorant or rude.   This didn't get a response.   Nobody said anything for a few seconds.\nSo I order a ham, salami and provolone sub.  He says, I don't have any bologna, I said I didn't order any bologna.  This went on two more times until the kid told him I didn't order bologna, but a number one sub.\nI got the sub and left.\nSubs are good, guy is a complete wacko!   Just nuts!
