After eating one of their incredible omelettes, complete with gluten free toast (!) and homemade strawberry jam, I am a fan!! Their food tasted amazing and felt very nourishing. This is totally a find in downtown Kalamazoo and we'll be back there to try out their burgers on another day, given how good breakfast was! Friendly staff made us feel like we were in our hometown instead of just passing through.
