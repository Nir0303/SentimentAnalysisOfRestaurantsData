I do not know if we will attempt this again.\n\nToday's experience...got there when it was super slow and was sat in a room alone and she said the waiter would be right with and we were in good hands. A waiter shows up ten minutes later and said he didn't even know we were there! The person seating people forgot about us in a span of one minute. We told him how we had just driven 6 hours and had just gotten back into town. We were exhausted. We wanted a quick meal and then go home to rest. \n\n He got back to us with our drinks and chips and salsa and we gave him our order. By now another table came in and then a huge party of maybe 12 people. 40 minutes passed and although we did get our guacamole and chips and salads we still didn't have our entrees. He kept saying I promise it will be out in a minute. We told him after the entrees finally came out to just bring us to go boxes because we had to leave. He said he would ask about taking 20% off the bill. It wasn't even the 20%, we just wanted to eat and go home. \n\nHe brings the boxes back and we have probably been waiting at this point an hour or more after getting seated and he brings the bill. No 20% off, no complimentary nothing. If he was not going to do it he should not have said anything.\n\n The kicker was when he left the bill there was no pen to sign it!!!!  My husband had already gone to the car. I had to dig and dig in my purse and come up with a pen. The last few experiences we have had with this La Mesa El Torito are similar with the exception of when we have an older Mexican gentleman as our waiter. He serves with class and seems to go out of his way as in above and beyond to make sure things are right.\n\n I cannot imagine it was this waiter's fault our food was so late. He kept checking on us and the restaurant was not full at all when we ordered so it was poor management. No one knowing about us when we were seated, waiting forever for the food, saying he would take 20% off the bill and didn't....I think we are done with this restaurant.\n\n It takes a lot for me to write a negative review but something is really wrong with this restaurant.

Our seating was in a quieter area perfect for 3 friends.  Our server was courteous and quick to get our drinks.  Our lunch portions were generous and filling.  I also ordered the flan.  i rate a place by their chips & salsa and the flan.  Both were very good at this place.  I will return even if it is just to sit down for dessert.

It was an wonderful experience -- far more than we expected from a restaurant chain.  We started with delicious Cadillac Margaritas, made from 1800 Tequila, and served with a shot of Grand Marnier on the side. The salsa served with our chips was fresh and very tasty, and the side of guacamole we asked for was also excellent.  I chose the Steak Fajita salad, which is served tableside so that you can put the fajita meat and vegetables on the salad yourself. The fajita steak was as tender, flavorful and juicy as sirloin, and in addition to the fajita onions and peppers, the salad included romaine lettuce, cotija cheese, half an avocado sliced in lengths, roasted pepitas, and fresh pico de gallo.  A vinaigrette dressing is provided on the side, but I didn't use it because the oils and juices from the fajita meat and vegetables made a perfect dressing. My daughter ordered the Grilled halibut fajitas, which looked wonderful, but the fish apparently became overcooked on the fajita pan, because it was a little tough and without flavor.  The service at this El Torito was very good, the decor was attractive and interesting, and the booths and tables offer privacy for conversation.  I'd recommend this restaurant for anyone desiring good Mexican food in the La Mesa/San Diego area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-08-31T12:37:21-0400", "location_id": "842590", "id": "139012443", "user": {"username": "Lemurcatta", "user_location": {"name": "Pine Mountain, Georgia", "id": "35187"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Sunday Brunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32579-d842590-r135713871-m11068-El_Torito_Mexican_Grill-La_Mesa_California.html#review135713871", "text": "We had a some family (18-20) down for a wedding and had placed a reservation for Sunday brunch.
