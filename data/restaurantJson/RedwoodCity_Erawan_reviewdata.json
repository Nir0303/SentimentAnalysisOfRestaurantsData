Redwood City has a few.  They all have pretty much the same menus, and entrees cost 11-14 dollars.  So Thai food is never budget in America.  And it rarely seems to be worth the cost.  The food looked great, on the plates of those eating in the restaurant.  We ordered take-away.  Green curry was yummy.  Portions pretty small.  None of our other dishes were exceptional: green papaya salad, wok tofu.
