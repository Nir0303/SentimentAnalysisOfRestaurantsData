Most of the complaints are about the service and not the food itself. Granted, the service may be slower during peak times, but stop and think why. Any restaurant that serves food like this is bound to be busy. The food here is excellent and I will share my experiences with this establishment. I went one night for take-out and the place was packed. There were people standing outside waiting to get in. The food was excellent and I had to experience other dishes while eating at the restaurant. I decided to go at 1130 am for an early lunch and there were only two other patrons at this time. This gave me a perfect opportunity to experience the menu and offer a fair and accurate review. The menu has several options and the recipes are from the Southern region of Italy. Cal Bruno and his wife were both at the restaurant during my visit. Being a native New Yorker, I had the pleasure of speaking with them and learning about their history. Mr. Bruno cooked my meal after the prep work was initiated by one of his line cooks. From start to finish, the owners interacted with me and shared a lot about themselves. The food is absolutely phenomenal! Everything was hot and fresh when it was served. The ingredients as well as the preparation of the meal were within view the entire time. This couple really takes the time to ensure that you have a good experience as well as an excellent meal. I understand that everyone is entitled to their opinion when it comes to a review, but take some of them at face value. Try this place earlier in the day and eat the food before you read or write a review. If you truly value a great meal, you will have the patience to deal with minor issues as some have previously complained about. Leaving one or two stars because you had to wait and didn't even eat the food creates an injustice for this restaurant. You have to give this restaurant a try and see it for yourself firsthand. Please note that this a fair and unbiased review and was written without any influence or coercion. I will eat here as often as I can and every time I visit the Lee County area. Hands down, and in my opinion, the absolute best location for Italian cuisine in Southern Florida.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-11-10T08:39:58-0500", "location_id": "7130701", "id": "436180320", "user": {"username": "FDNYTruckie", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Great food and service!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34230-d7130701-r435625486-m11068-Bruno_s_of_Brooklyn_Italian_Eatery-Fort_Myers_Florida.html#review435625486", "text": "Last week my daughter and I went to Bruno's for a late Saturday night dinner.

It is what you would imagine if you were asked to think of a small Italian restaurant in the middle of Brooklyn. My wife and I, accompanied by our son and his girlfriend, went there last night for dinner. When we walked in it was the delicious smell that hit me, along with the bustle and energy of the place. I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nOur hostess/waitress, Genevieve, is in fact the wife of the chef, Cal Bruno - yes this place is run and worked by a husband and wife team. Genevieve is a lovely lady who never stopped moving. When she described the wine to us it was with a passion from a lady who loves wine, her recommendations were delicious. When she described the food it was with serious pride, and she had a lot to be proud of - the food was fantastic. She also had visible pride in her husband, who was cooking furiously in the kitchen - but he took the time to smile and wave at us.\n\nWe started off with Calamari, which was cooked to perfection, and I really mean perfect! This was paired very well with a nice bottle of Chianti. We ordered our entrees and everybody ordered something different; my wife ordered the Sausage and Peppers, my son the Lasagne and Meatballs, his girlfriend the Ravioli and Meatballs and I asked Genevieve to pick something out for me. She smiled, asked me if I liked veal (I answered yes), and she nodded her head. We ordered more wine. The food arrived, hot and fresh off the stove. It was very, very good Italian food; it was all delicious. I had the Veal Chop, which was, like the rest of the food, delicious. I admit that I really love Sausage and Peppers and Bruno's version of this dish was possibly the best I ever had.\n\nThe Espressos after dinner were very well made, and I like a good espresso. Genevieve brought over a sample of some Cannoli Cake her husband had made fresh... all I can say is WOW! \n\nThe whole meal was great. We were all very impressed. Cal and Genevieve were friendly and gracious hosts. We will be back.

They had one osso bucco special left. Glad I snared it. It was absolutely delicious, served with house made pappardelle pasta. My husband had the penne pasta with vodka sauce with shrimp. Also delicious. The place is teeny tiny, but we enjoyed sitting at the counter watching the chefs do their thing. The pappardelle with broccoli rabe and Italian sausage looked great--I'll be having that the next time we go. Limoncello mascarpone with sponge cake for dessert. Mighty yummy, but I was craving Torta della Nonna. They didn't have it as they were getting ready to close for 3 weeks vacation. Not to worry, we'll be back to sample it. Very nice, professional service. Friendly people.
