It has no ambiance, but the food was great and the staff very nice.  My mom and I stumbled into this small place.  The cook offered us a free appetizer to try.  The lamb kabob, beef/lamb gyro and rice was good.  We took baklava to go and it was delicious.  They only have a few tables and it is noisy with the street traffic.  I think most people get it to go.  Worth a stop if you crave a gyro or kabob.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-25T14:01:11-0400", "location_id": "9793646", "id": "358549001", "user": {"username": "Denice M", "user_location": {"name": "Roseville, California, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Freshest Middle Eastern fare in Berkeley", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32066-d9793646-r358120198-m11068-Kobani_Mediterranean_Grill-Berkeley_California.html#review358120198", "text": "Eating here is like eating with family.  Each dish is freshly prepared (so there's a bit of a wait, so worth it) and everything is so good: the mezze platter (hummus, baba ganouj, feta, dolmathes, olives, pita), the veggie moussaka (eggplant dish), fresh garden salads, lamb kebabs, gyros. My favorite is the yogurt: thick, rich yogurt with cucumber and dill. Again, freshly made.
