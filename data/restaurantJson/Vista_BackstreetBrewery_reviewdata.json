The bartenders are friendly and efficient.  We ordered off the Happy Hour menu and were not disappointed.  The wings were very good (be sure to order them twice baked for best results).  The chicken quesadillas were done well and tasty.  We had the four-beer sampler and it was well worth the price.  Overall it's a nice place and they have a decent size dining room for those who desire it.  It's one of those places that's not easy to find, but worth it once you do.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-27T06:21:48-0400", "location_id": "10643540", "id": "397931883", "user": {"username": "Gordon C", "user_location": {"name": "Carlsbad, California", "id": "32171"}}}]}
