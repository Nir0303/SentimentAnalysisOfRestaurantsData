Corey knew what I could and couldn't eat and only had to check on one item to be certain.  He has an excellent beer knowledge, too, and let us take our time and ask many questions about drinks and dinner.  We will tell others about Nuevo and definitely be back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-19T11:58:59-0400", "location_id": "5108080", "id": "407602081", "user": {"username": "Dawn G", "user_location": {"name": "Akron, Ohio", "id": "29912"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Modern Spin as Advertised", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29912-d5108080-r405424734-m11068-Nuevo_Modern_Mexican_Tequila_Bar-Akron_Ohio.html#review405424734", "text": "As advertised, Nuevo puts a modern spin on classic Mexican dishes.   Located in downtown Akron, this renovated historical site has an inside bar, rooftop bar and several dining spaces.  Appetizers and meals seemed reasonably priced.  Drink prices varied based on what was ordered, and, their drink specialties are tequila and margaritas.  \n\nOur party of six shared the salsa and guacamole appetizers.  Each item came with 3 unique guacamoles and salsas which were absolutely delicious.  Our party had the chicken quesadillas, flank steak, skilpack vegetarian burrito, scallops, and trout..  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Each item had an unusual twist on the flavors holding true to the restaurant\u2019s mission.  Portions were large enough to share since everyone took home about half of their entree.\n\nThis is a local restaurant which adds to an exciting restored vibe in downtown Akron. Nuevo is a busy place, so reservations are a must.  Valet parking is available or park on the street or in the public parking deck behind the restaurant. The public parking deck is free after 9pm. The restaurant is close to the channel lock and baseball stadium.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-14T13:46:05-0400", "location_id": "5108080", "id": "405424734", "user": {"username": "1TravelMonkey", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Not your average Mexican restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29912-d5108080-r403881378-m11068-Nuevo_Modern_Mexican_Tequila_Bar-Akron_Ohio.html#review403881378", "text": "They were very gracious when we were late because of a downpour.
