We passed by this restaurant and I dropped off my family as I sought to find some parking.  It took me about 15 minutes to find any parking, which happened to be in a lot on an adjacent street.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly.  The food was plentiful and tasted good.  The margaritas we ordered tasted quite odd so we sent them back for other selections.\n\nIf there was better parking, I could see going back there again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-17T14:20:02-0400", "location_id": "371482", "id": "393686416", "user": {"username": "Ericgator", "user_location": {"name": "Mooresville, NC", "id": null}}}]}
