Erected in 1888, after four years of construction, you can clearly see the Indiana Limestone in French Neo Baroque style.  The decorated stone and ornate columns give you a sense of longevity, this building is not going away soon.  The bell in the clock tower still tolls on the hour.  Go inside and have a look around.  As you enter, Security will ask for your keys, cell phones, the usual for the x-ray screening as it is, after all, a government building. A couple steps beyond Security, you'll find yourself in the rotunda surrounded by four beautiful, well lit murals depicting positive aspects of Wabash Valley culture.  The murals were donated by Saint Mary of the Woods, the local bar association and two other local organizations.  Look up and gasp at the interior view of the dome.  The  county courts and other offices populate the four floors.  The doors, moldings, railings are solid wood and in pristine condition.  Know that you are seeing evidence of your tax dollars at work.  Enjoy, it's your courthouse.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-13T07:44:34-0400", "location_id": "11675040", "id": "427624119", "user": {"username": "beetcanner", "user_location": {"name": "Southern Nevada", "id": null}}}]}
