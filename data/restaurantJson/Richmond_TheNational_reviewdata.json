The National is standing room only on the bottom floor with stadium seating upstairs. Depending on the show you may or may not have access to the balcony area. This is often the VIP section for larger acts, not always. That said, if the balcony is open to the General Public you will definitely want to get to the venue early enough to get a table right on the edge of the balcony. That is the best view in the house unless you can score one of the four boxes on either side of the stage. They truly did an amazing job ensuring that this venue would be completely acoustically sound with a floating stage and all kinds of fancy high-tech adaptations. They even reinforced the ceiling to be able to hold the heavy equipment that bands may be using in larger cities. The employees at the national are generally all very nice but the drinks are incredibly overpriced so do your drinking before you go in! You will be paying $12 for a PBR if you do not take this into consideration before whatever show you are seeing. Of course some shows are all ages but generally they have bars set up on both floors, the VIP section and the lobby, as well as the smoking patio area. Getting a drink is not hard, it's just expensive. Of course be careful of getting too intoxicated because they will put you out in a heartbeat if you create any sort of issue in the club. I personally appreciate that in a venue. So, the national is an affordable place to see shows but not an affordable place to drink. It sounds great inside and overall the staff is friendly. What else could you ask for? Like many things in Richmond it is a historic building and that adds extra character. If you can get upstairs into the VIP area there is cool room with old paintings on the wall of children and their toys. It's a little creepy but really cool.\n1 tip for out-of-towners is to go ahead and pay to park in the parking deck. Some of the blocks surrounding the National can be a little sketchy at night.
