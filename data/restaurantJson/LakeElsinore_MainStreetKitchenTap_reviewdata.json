Though we got there at only 5 minutes to six and ordered well after, I was still given the \"happy hour\" prices to my surprise. I had a Pineapple Sculpin to start and it was too \"hoppy\" for my taste and passed it to my friend then ordered Orange Hefe, yeah I'm a wuss when it comes to the hops. I ordered the prime rib sliders and onion rings which were surprisingly made from red onions...and it was all tasty. The sliders were really a sandwich or dip that is cut into 4 and came with some of their homemade chips...again surprised because I didn't notice the menu saying that. Their homemade chips aren't like any other I have had, super thin and seasoned rather than thick and oily with just salt. My friends had pizzas and I was too into my meal to try theirs but they assure me it was delicious. When I asked if it would be too much trouble for separate checks, our server didn't bat a lash and said no problem at all.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-08T16:27:55-0400", "location_id": "10546782", "id": "416293079", "user": {"username": "Onecrazykitty", "user_location": {"name": "Fallbrook, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great Hidden Gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32595-d10546782-r408930404-m11068-Main_Street_Kitchen_Tap-Lake_Elsinore_California.html#review408930404", "text": "This place is just what we needed on Main Street!
