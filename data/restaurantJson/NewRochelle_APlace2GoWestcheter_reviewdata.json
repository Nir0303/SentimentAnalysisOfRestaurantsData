I thoroughly enjoyed the music. Very nice!\nHowever, it took an exceptionally long time  for our waiter to show up, and when he did, it was not a pleasant \"hello\",but more like we were another bother. I was shocked by his attitude and remained unimpressed throughout the night. When he finally got our food to us, he literally put the food on the table and pushed it across to whomever, and I mean whomever it landed in front of. That in itself was just inappropriate. My mouth dropped open throughout the night by his behavior, including the fact that there was another table across from us with a few young ladies whom he seemed to have taken a liking to, and I think at that time everyone else just became an imposition, because that's where he wanted to be and spent his entire time there. I think his shift should have ended then. It took us a very long time to get his attention, our check, to get his attention to order our last round of drinks. The entire dining experience was like pulling teeth, and unlike anything I had experienced in any other dining establishment. The food was also average, in my opinion and the waiter never bothered to give us water, and it was impossible to get his attention.\nWhen I ordered the last round of drinks. He took the order, went back to the ladies, then after a while he took the order to the bar, went back to the ladies and we had to remind him to get our drinks. After he finally did . He left the check on the table and I just took it to the bar to take care of it myself, instead of bothering him. \nI have to commend the hostesses who did an amazing job every time we encountered with them.

Several tables were put together in the middle of the restaurant to accommodate our large group.  It was a bit tight because the place was filled with patrons, and we were bumped into here and there, but we were still able to sit comfortably.  Booth seating was also available.\n\nThe food and service were a hit despite the heavy crowd.  Our waiter was very pleasant and he checked in on us often.  We ordered mixed drinks, appetizers and entrees which all appeared in a decent amount of time.  My favorites were the coconut shrimp appetizer and the jerk chicken.  The shrimp was succulent and crunchy, while the jerk chicken was subtly sweet and aromatic.  It was the best jerk chicken I've ever had and I eat a lot of jerk chicken!  I chose to have rice and peas with my chicken, but white rice was also an option.  The portions were very generous although I wished I could eat more.  The rest of my table seemed to enjoy their meals - all cleared plates!  Our table mostly ordered oxtail which was very tasty.  Kid friendly items were on the menu like chicken fingers and mac and cheese.  \n\nA very friendly gentleman walked around taking pictures possibly for their website.  He gladly offered to email photos to patrons who wanted copies.  \n\nThis is a restaurant worth visiting again.  The food was very good and the atmosphere was quite festive.  There was a bar near the front of the restaurant which doled out tasty drinks.  In general, the staff was way above par and accommodating.  I would recommend this place for any occasion.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-12-28T20:26:28-0500", "location_id": "4085620", "id": "246278572", "user": {"username": "AkosiaNYC", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}]}
