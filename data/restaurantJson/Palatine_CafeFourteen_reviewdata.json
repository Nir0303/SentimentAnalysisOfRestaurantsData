The other person with me on this trip had a turkey burger and it was slightly over done but had good flavor. The bread basket had sliced French bread with good taste but a little dry. I hope all restaurants will eventually wrap bread in the bread basket to keep it fresh and not handled a lot. I would say over all a good rating especially because of the soup.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-07-20T10:37:35-0400", "location_id": "429829", "id": "168316662", "user": {"username": "25Bud", "user_location": {"name": "Lombard", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-01", "title": "A Noon Time coffee shop", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36511-d429829-r129817289-m11068-Cafe_Fourteen-Palatine_Illinois.html#review129817289", "text": "Food is ok, service is friendly.

The manager is so nice and was walking around talking to everyone and joking with customers. Our server was fantastic and very friendly. It is open for breakfast and lunch and we would definitely go back there.
