We went to Bistro 258 regularly, and were happy when we read about the new owners of the location were going to keep some of the Bistro's recipes along with the their own Craft Burgers. When we were seated and asked about what we would like to drink, we inquired about the beer. The person told us about what was on tap. We could see a whole cooler with what looked like a pretty good selection in it, but were never offered a beer or wine menu. That was fine, since we chose what was on tap. Good lunch menu...craft burgers, sandwiches and salads. We all chose a different burger, and they were all okay. Asking about the menu, we were told the other sandwiches and wraps were lunch only, and they have dinner entrees (where the Bistro recipes come in....) and the burgers at night. Not sure why they would drop the sandwiches/wraps for the evening. If I go out and don't feel like a full up dinner, or a burger, a sandwich/wrap option would be plus. Service was ok. Not horrible, but not great either. Hope these things are all happening because of the recent move and opening. We will give Craft Burger a try again and hopefully have a better experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-07T06:49:23-0500", "location_id": "6509888", "id": "353596079", "user": {"username": "rsjj", "user_location": {"name": "Utah", "id": null}}}]}
