We were in the area early on a Saturday evening.  Small and inviting place, obviously family run. Pizza supposedly the feature but a lot of patrons eating other dishes. \n\nWe had two different pizzas and a spaghetti & meatballs.  Regina pizza with added sausage was fine, although needed salt and was also pretty wet.  Tasty though. Wifey had a Bianca with added Gaeta olives...which turned out to NOT be Gaeta variety.  Having owned a fine dining Italian restaurant, I know my olives...and Gaetas are NOT green.  The server insisted they were but I let it slide as I wasn't in the mood to argue. \n\nKids spaghetti was very flavorful, and al dente.  The meatball to rather meat patty (it was flat) was fried, then had sauce dribbled on it, not cooked in the sauce.  Flavor was good but a bit chewy.  \n\nService was OK.  I suspect the regulars get more attention, but that's not a surprise.\n\nAll in all, good if you're in the area but I wouldn't go far out of my way. \n\nGB", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-06T14:03:21-0500", "location_id": "1013151", "id": "435186333", "user": {"username": "GianniB", "user_location": {"name": "Gilbert, Arizona", "id": "31230"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Perfect", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31231-d1013151-r430744145-m11068-La_Piazza_al_Forno-Glendale_Arizona.html#review430744145", "text": "Dulce diavolo is the best pizza topping I have ever had.

We had the Rigatoni Al Forno pasta and the Italian Stallion pizza. Both were delicious! Sandi was a wonderful waitress. This place can get busy on weekends so be prepared for a possible wait, but its definitely worth it.
