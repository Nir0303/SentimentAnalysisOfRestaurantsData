Lots of vintage and antiques mixed with repurposed items.  The shop owner was very nice and kind and even offered to make me a deal on a few items.  Definitely worth the trip when I go and I always try to go back.  If you are into interior decorating and want to do it for a steel this is the place to go.  If you just love looking at old and things from days gone by then this is the place too.  I have never seen the same thing twice.  She says she brings new items in daily and I believe it.  I don't think you will leave empty handed when you go here, I never do.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-07-16T09:44:54-0400", "location_id": "8442229", "id": "289561804", "user": {"username": "ozarks_7", "user_location": {"name": "ozarks", "id": null}}}]}
