Yang's was busy, with front mostly full, and large party of 20 in the back room.  I cleared a table for us in the corner, and retrieved 2 menus and we sat.  After 5 minutes we had decided on Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries, and the Reuben with Potato Salad. After 10 minutes, a waitress came by, got 2 waters and service, and took our order.  She added we were not in her section, but our waitress had the big party by herself. There was a help wanted sign in the window.  The place was busy, and it really needs a steam cleaning from ceiling to floor.  We hoped for good food and we waited some more.\n\nThe food was wonderful!  The corned beef was cooked and thick sliced by Sang's.  Corned beef was tender, juicy, and ample.  The rye was grilled just right, the sauerkraut was right on, and the mustard was spicy.  It was awesome.  The potato salad was very good, and I tasted to me like there was bacon in it.  The Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich looked huge, with slices of tender steak.  A different take on Sweet Potato Fries - cubed, roasted (I think), and then into fryer only when ordered.  Tasty, but not like traditional long thin french fry cut.\n\nI commented to the waitress how good the corned beef was, and added, \"You cook and slice the corned beef here, don't you?\"  She looked surprised, and stated that it was cooked and sliced in the kitchen, \n\nOverall, the restaurant serves a lot of diners, and it has a look that says that.  A little worn, a little grime, and in need of a serious cleaning.

The food is superb, serving\u2019s huge, great value, excellent service. Steinbeck ate here! The people watching is great and the regulars are always hanging on the stools at the counter. The breakfast menu is like reading a novel. The corned beef hash is homemade and to die for, the biscuits and gravy too! The lamb shanks for lunch are one of my favorites and with at least 12 daily specials to pick from, who needs that book sized menu! The salsa at every table is a bonus used on any meal. All the food comes out of the quintessential greasy spoon kitchen, manned by a family of Chinese cooks all wearing colorful chef\u2019s caps in all kinds of Hawaiian patterns. The foods so damn good you don\u2019t want to look to close at the kitchen. Why the good bye? I\u2019m a nurse and after years of loving this place I got turned off by the cook/cashier, who has some kind of skin disorder on all his fingers. I\u2019m sorry he does and if it\u2019s not contagious, well, it looks bad and grossed me out. Great food, but the cook should be wearing gloves.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-04-27T09:00:32-0400", "location_id": "450202", "id": "202988786", "user": {"username": "vdoolittle", "user_location": {"name": "Salinas, California", "id": "33002"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Sunday Breakfast", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33002-d450202-r201996359-m11068-Sangs_Cafe-Salinas_California.html#review201996359", "text": "Lot of food, decent price.\nHas lots of seating.\nWell lit\nDifferent size tables.\nLike having Sunday breakfast there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-04-20T19:27:31-0400", "location_id": "450202", "id": "201996359", "user": {"username": "LuigiCalifornia", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}]}
