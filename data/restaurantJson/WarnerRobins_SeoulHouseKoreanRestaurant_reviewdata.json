I was so excited to find Korean food within a 30 mile radius. I have been craving dumplings and kimchi for two weeks, since visiting a Korean restaurant in Duluth. \n\nThe owner is friendly and the food is excellent! (The restaurant ambiance is far from swanky, but the food is worth the 30 min. drive.)\n\nMy son and I shared the beef dumplings appetizer. I had the pan fried kimchi with boiled tofu, and my son had the spicy seafood noodle soup. We were both stuffed. I told him that I'd gladly sacrifice my figure for this food! I'm still in the restaurant... Can't move.... Food coma... And I love it!\n\nI think we will add this to our rotation monthly.

My wife and I have been eating there for about 7 years. I've lived in Korea, so I can attest to the authenticity of the food. The owner is a sweet Korean lady who does most of the cooking and food prep herself.\n\nThe traditional fresh kimchi, cucumber kimchi and other appetizers are always tasty and come in traditional small bowls before the meal. The dwaeji bulgoki (spicy pork) and beef bulgoki are excellent. My children, ages 7 and 4, like the japchae (noodles and vegetables).\n\nThe service can be a little slow at times, but relax, you're basically getting a meal cooked by your surrogate Korean grandmother! The food is worth the wait if you want good Korean. I like this restaurant much better than Korean restaurants I've eaten at in The Atlanta area.
