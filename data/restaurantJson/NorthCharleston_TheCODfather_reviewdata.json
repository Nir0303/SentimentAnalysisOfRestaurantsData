I added a side of mushy peas.  The portion is huge.  The next time, we might order one full basket with an extra side of chips.  \n\nThe fish came out steaming hot with a perfect thin layer of crispy heaven.  The fish was moist and flaky.    \n\nThe mushy peas, heavily seasoned with pepper, were good and unlike anything I had before.\n\nIt is hard to believe you can eat this good, this cheaply in the Charleston area", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-24T18:10:13-0400", "location_id": "9759159", "id": "385689049", "user": {"username": "Mountaineer_Steve", "user_location": {"name": "Columbia, SC", "id": null}}}]}
