You can stop in and pick up a few bottles to take home or to a friends party, or you can opt to pay the \"corkage fee\" and drink the beer at the bar itself, or you can cozy up to the bar or sit at a table or booth and enjoy what's on tap.  Lots of options. Local snacks available, gourmet popcorn, taro chips and pot pies, but the management is also open to you popping over to Hank's Haute Dogs or any other SALT complex vendor and carrying food in with you. Please no food from outside SALT or home.  Village is a great destination all on its own, but smack in the middle of the developing SALT complex, it will be a great before or after spot.  Only drawback of Village (and SALT itself) is the parking.  Street parking is tough to get, and the cost of the parking deck or the lot (which are the same price) gets pricey after a few hours.  Best bet if you can't get street parking is to talk to a Village staffer about the way to making the validation work for you but also not break the bank.  After all, you want those dollars to go for great beers, not parking time.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-07T18:40:58-0400", "location_id": "10816195", "id": "415956916", "user": {"username": "kalamakid", "user_location": {"name": "Kailua, Hawaii", "id": "60652"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great Spot for Unusual Beers in Honolulu", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d10816195-r414632937-m11068-Village_Bottle_Shop_Tasting_Room-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html#review414632937", "text": "Tim and Daryn have come up with a unique concept.  Part bottle shop where you can choose from over 450 varieties of bottle beer, and not the ones you can always find in Whole foods, some really unusual selections, which you can pop in and purchase to take out or you can pay a small fee to drink on the premises.  Seating available at the bar, booth and table, room holds about 40 people. Not big but it feel airy and comfortable with a really good noise level compared to most places to drink in this town.  Rotating beers on tap are excellent, about 20, and a rotating wine selection as well.  Although not a food establishment, management does encourage patrons to buy from the other SALT complex fooderies and bring in to eat (Hank's Haute Dogs being a favorite) however not food from outside SALT or home, please. Also available gourmet snacks from local companies, popcorn and taro chips and pot pies, all locally made.  We love the atmosphere, the staff and management. Only issue is parking. There is some street parking but hard to come by and the \"validated\" parking is still quite pricey.  You can park in the SALT lot or parking structure, but be sure and talk to the Village staff about the best way to not go about paying a fortune to get your car out. They have good strategies to employ. Wonderful and much needed addition to the Hawaii bar scene.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-04T10:12:23-0400", "location_id": "10816195", "id": "414632937", "user": {"username": "kalamakid", "user_location": {"name": "Kailua, Hawaii", "id": "60652"}}}]}
