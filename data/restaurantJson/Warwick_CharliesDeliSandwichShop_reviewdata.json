I especially like Charlie's Special which is an Italian grinder, and their little meat pies.

I love the pre packaged salads. I know, that sounds very unlikely, but they really are good. The dressings are excellent. I wish they would have the Mediterranean salad more often, that is my favorite. I get the chicken Caesar if the Mediterranean salad isn't there. Be sure to check the date...but, these salads go quickly, so it usually isn't an issue. Unfortunately, I have found most of the sandwiches and soups to be just average and not very flavorful. The cook does not know where the spices are. The soups are made with good ingredients, but I have to season them on the stove when I get home. It is too bad, because it would be nice to get some hot soup to eat there instead of having to take it home and fix it up. Overall, this place is one of the better places to eat lunch in this neighborhood.
