This beautiful park is 55 acres and offers paved paths for walking or exercising and Rainbow Trout can be found in several of the ponds. Most of the paths are bicycle free and pets must be on a leash. The ponds remain pretty much ice free in the winter because they are spring fed.  There are rest rooms and ample parking.
