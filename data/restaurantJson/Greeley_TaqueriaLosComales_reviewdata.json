This restaurant is NOT affiliated with the Taqueria Los Comales in LOVELAND, CO. Located in the same building as a grocery market - called Jerry's.  At first was a little apprehensive with the outside area and location, but once you went inside it was a cute little mexican cafe.  Obviously locals go here, as well as Newbie's, like ourselves.  Their Salsa Bar is amazing - tons to choose from to doctor up your dish.  Staff was very friendly.  Service was quick.  Food was tasty.  More of a \"Mexico\" flare, than a typical mexican restaurant. I ordered the Burrito Al Pastor (marinated pork) with green chili.  The beans were good - flavorful but a tad on the bland side.  Rice was tasty, fluffy.  The Burrito itself was flavorful.  The marinated pork looked a lot like Chorizo, and I had to clarify if I had the right burrito. From what I could tell, they did not have shredded pork or ground beef as an option for the burrito filling.  I've never had green chili made like this before, but it was more of a dark green stew with green chili's and looked to be green peppers.  My friend ordered the Chilaquiles and she too said her meal was delicious - beans very flavorful.\n\nThey also serve breakfast all day.  On the kitchen's counter there were large jars filled with Agua de Horchata (rice drink), Agua de Melon (cantaloupe water), and some sort of lemonade drink.\n\nPRICE:  Cheap Eats - very reasonable.\nSTAFF:  Very nice, quick and efficient service.\nFOOD:  Very Good and tasty!  THEY DO NOT SERVE BEER or ALCOHOL.\n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised and glad we tried this place out.  If you're in the mood for a little something different - GO TO TAQUERIA LOS COMALES.
