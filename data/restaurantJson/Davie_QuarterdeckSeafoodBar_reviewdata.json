We just ate there. Nothing was right.  The crabcakes didn't hit the mark.  The entrees were served cold.  I couldn't eat my dinner after just one bite.  My wife and Mother in Law ate their dinners but didn't care for it at all. We ate here years ago and it was not good, but since the beach location was so good, we thought we would try this location.  Big mistake.  The waiter was very nice and the Manager came by and took my uneaten dinner off the check. He offered me something else but I respectively declined and went home and made something to eat.  I told the manager very nicely that we really liked the beach location but this location didn't have it.We will never go back.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Frank Z, Owner at Quarterdeck Seafood Bar, responded to this review", "text": "I would like to apologize for the recent experience you had while dining at Quarterdeck Restaurant.
