The chef was able to accommodate several requests for meals outside of the standard catering menu, and it was all delicious.\nThe guest rooms were also very comfortable.  Reasonably spacious, current and clean...even the tv was easy to operate!\nSeveral of our guests offered compliments on my choice of location.

My co-workers and I had a dinner there (mine was excellent), and I had four breakfasts there (also excellent). I have dietary restrictions, and the kitchen accommodated my requests fully each time. I also would like to say thanks to the breakfast server team, whose members were always smiling and friendly and attentive.\n\nHere are three minor quirks: \n- There seems to be no direct walking line from the parking garage. I often parked on the first garage level (easy to do when the hotel isn't busy), and I had to walk over the gate median to get to the front walkway. When I parked on a garage upper level, the elevators took me down to a lobby in the garage ground floor, and then you have to walk around to the right. But the exit door is not well marked, so it was a little bit confusing (for me and one other stranger guest).\n\n- I use Apple Maps on my iPhone. I noticed sometimes the directions had me travel to the hotel via the main road out front, but sometimes the directions had me travel through the neighborhood behind the hotel. The neighborhood does not look anything like a hotel area, so it's a bit confusing. A co-worker had warned me of this, so when I drove through the neighborhood I wasn't overly concerned about being lost, but new visitors should make sure to first access the hotel via the main road.\n\n- My room had a glass wall separating the toilet from the sink. In the middle of the night, at low light, the glass wall is barely visible. I didn't have the misfortune of walking into it, but I had to continually remind myself to look for it. I actually thought about sticking a piece of reflective tape on it to increase its visibility, but of course I didn't have any reflective tape.\n\nOverall a great experience, and I would be very happy to stay here again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Stephan M, General Manager at Hyatt Regency Aurora - Denver Conference Center, responded to this review", "text": "Dear Craig W,\n\nThank you so much for your review and five star rating!

I was very pleasantly surprised by the high level of finishes there, both in the common areas and my hotel room. The staff were all very friendly -- Anelia at the front desk was very gracious and provided a great Diamond Upgrade that was very comfortable and spacious (my daughter joined me to watch the Broncos game). Michael at the bar was very pleasant and helpful with a a late \"to go\" lunch. The location appears to be well-placed to serve the nearby local Anshutz Medical Center and, while on the eastern edge of Denver, is likely popular with meeting planners due to the proximity to the light rail system which provides good access to both downtown and DIA.

I arrived early (11am) and was hoping for an early check-in but was told that there were no rooms available, which is completely understandable. I asked when they thought that a room might be available and they said around 12:30 and that I would have to check back with them at that time. I decided to sit and wait in the hotel lobby until that time and I noticed that, a bit before 12:30, one of the employees approached a customer sitting nearby me and offered for him to check into a room/informed him that a room was now available. I did not appreciate this arbitrary approach to assigning newly-cleaned rooms (in fact, upon arrival, one of the front desk staff told me that early check-in was \"first-come, first-served). What would make a lot more sense to me would be if they would take down your phone number in the order of arrival and text each person, in order, as rooms became available. This strikes me as a far more fair process.\n\nThe room itself was clean and spacious. My major qualms were the following: 1. The shower was extremely poorly designed...It is an open shower with a glass panel that extends for half the length of the shower, with the other half open/walk-in. This would ordinarily pose no problem except for the fact that the non-adjustable shower head sprayed water so far, such that the water was spraying beyond the covered portion of the glass onto the bathroom floor. Each time I showered, I had a HUGE puddle to clean up which required me to use multiple towels. 2. The hairdryer was so loud that it was deafening. I legitimately felt like it was a hazard to my ears. I understand that hotels cannot afford to get fancy hairdryers but I would strongly suggest seeking out a more quiet hairdryer. \n\nFinally, my biggest complaint is that my room was never cleaned (other than upon arrival, of course). I stayed for 2 nights and when I arrived back on the second evening I found that my room had not been cleaned. I double-checked that I did not have the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, which I did not. I went down to the front desk to ask why my room was never cleaned and the response I received was less-than-satisfactory. The woman at the front desk said \"I'm sorry, that's weird, we have you down for two nights so your room definitely should have been cleaned...\" She asked if I would like my room cleaned at the time (it was 4pm) and I told her that I had just had a stressful day on business and that I wanted to spend the rest of my day resting in my room. I therefore made it clear that I did not wish to have my room cleaned that late in the day and I was disappointed that it had not been done earlier. She said she \"would definitely mention it to somebody\" but was not apologetic. I do not think this is acceptable. To add insult to injury, 5 minutes later a member of the housekeeping staff knocked loudly on my door (multiple times) while I was on an important business call. Keep in mind this is after I explicitly requested to be left alone for the remainder of the evening. When I tried to tell her that my room had not been cleaned earlier in the day but that I did not wish for it to be cleaned now, we had a long, drawn out conversation that was going in circles because she did not speak English. I obviously don't blame the housekeeping staff member because she was trying her best but I think there is a breakdown in communication between the hotel staff as I really did not wish to have my room cleaned so late in the evening. \n\nIf the hotel were to fix the aforementioned issues I think it would be a nice place to stay.

The Hyatt is VERY conveniently located literally across the street from the convention center.  I was EXTREMELY surprised to see how well kept up and run this hotel was given the massive amounts of people that run in an out - literally.  \n\nThe drive in was very large and accommodated drivers, taxis, peditaxis, and ubers easily.  Check in was extremely quick.  On check in I had slightly mixed results.  Jessica was very professional and thorough covering everything from directions, points, etc.  My initial check in person was sweet but not thorough.  \n\nThe Altitude restaurant was well run.  The restaurant manager, Chris, used to work at Disney and his attention to making everything beyond wonderful showed.  The only thing he didn't do was to tell me to have a magical day --- lol.  At the restaurant, Anisette got us coffee instantly, Dani was our waitress and pleasant.  The $18.00 buffet was as good at what was being charge by the Four Seasons where I stayed just a few weeks earlier, but at 2.5 times less!  Casey chatted with me very politely as she made a great Omlette.\n\nThe Regency Club, the concierge's club, was excellent.  Well kept up and staffed.  \n\nThe room was very updated, clean and in great condition.  Electrical sockets were everywhere from the desk to each side bed table.  Cleaning ladies were in and out quick and thorough.\n\nThis hotel is wonderfully managed and well kept.  This was a pleasant surprise being a convention center hotel!
