I don't know what has happened,  Rao's used to be the bakery to visit.  I order cakes usually for special occasions.  The last three times,  the order has been taken and paid for.  All three times,  they tried to charge me again after I paid over the phone.  This last order,  the person argued with me that I didn't give him enough numbers over the phone...  I said,  I did.  He said no...  This went on for 10 mins after he kept trying.  Finally puts me on hold and voila someone else manages to do what he couldn't.  Plain rude this person was.  So,  I get there to the drive through,  someone comes on and asks can I help you...  I said,  picking up a cake,  they mumbled something which I couldn't understand,  I ask to repeat please and wait....  Nothing,  so I pull up to the window,  the guy sees me pull up while walking away from the window....  I sat for about eight minutes and nothing.  So...  I drive around and walk in and tell the inside person the story....  She says \"you can't pick up cakes at the window\".  I said,  get someone who speaks clearly to tell people that.  So,  off she goes,  and behold,  for the third time,  they can't find the cake.  I wait and wait and manager comes to tell me that someone else picked it up.  I said no,  Raos, and me are the only people who knew I ordered it.  So more time passes and here comes the cake.  Then she rings it up and I tell her I paid.  She said no,  I said yes.  The manager says \"just give it to him\" like I'm a common thief running a scam.  I said,  let me show you my phone where it has been billed...  No he said,  it's fine...  Then the cake was garbage.
