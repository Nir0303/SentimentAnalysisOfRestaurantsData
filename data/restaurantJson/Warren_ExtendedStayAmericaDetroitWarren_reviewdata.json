There are lots of nearby restaurants.  Some are even within walking distance.\n\nThe Warren Civic Center is about a block away.  City hall and the library are located there.  This ten year old building (the Civic Center) is an architectural centerpiece of this community (as was the nearby GM Tech Center in the 1950s).\n\nIf you are lucky enough to book an overnight stay on a Saturday night, be sure to visit the local farmer's market on Sunday morning (in front of the Civic Center).  \n\nOkay, turn on Google maps and look at the local neighborhood.  You will see just to the South is a Wal-mart.  Fill your room fridge cheaply if you want.  Look to the North.  Buddy's Pizza is on the corner of Old 13 mile Rd.  Buddy's is one of the Detroit metro area's best pizza places (check out the reviews...Buddy's is always in the top 10 Tripadvisor list for Warren restaurants).  National Coney Island is just across the parking lot to the West (a three minute walk), and they are also in TA's Warren top 10 restaurants list.\n\nThe room-suite at this Extended Stay hotel is better than most Extended Stay layouts.  The suite feels more like a hotel suite and a lot less like a cheapo college one room dorm apartment.  The kitchen (not kitchenette) has a lot more counter space and cabinets than most Extended Stays and it comes complete with a real stove, real oven, real dishwasher as well as the usual full size fridge and microwave oven.  If you need pots and pans, toaster, plates, silverware you will have to arrange with the front desk to have those items delivered to your room.\n\nThe bed was average... not too hard and not too soft.  It is certainly not plush like any 3 or 4 star hotel bed.  Expect a 2 star hotel quality bed.  \n\nAs with most Extended Stay hotels, this room (#218) did have some problems but most were minor.  The toilet didn't flush well.  We had to get a plunger from the front desk and do it ourselves because the maintenance staff had gone home for the day.  The faucet in the bathtub dripped constantly, but since we weren't paying the water bill I didn't care.  The ceiling above the TV area squeaked every time the person (or elephant) in the room above us got up to walk around.  The trim at the top of the refrigerator door was missing and a dangerous sharp edge was exposed.\n\nI would definitely recommend bidding low on Priceline or selecting a 2-1/2 star Hotwire, pet-friendly hotel with on-site laundry.  You will likely end up staying here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Manager_11525, Manager at Extended Stay America - Detroit - Warren, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to write a thorough review of your stay at our hotel.

IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS HOTEL, DON'T!!! I don't know where to begin except that this hotel is filthy, unsafe, and uninhabitable. The management interior photos are NOT the actual photos of this hotel. I made the mistake of booking this hotel for a family stay based on the reviews and photos. To my horror, after checking into our room, it was something out of a horror film... the hallways were dark, run-down, and dirty. The elevator lights were half out and looked like someone was murdered in the elevator. The room itself was absolutely disgusting - please see the photos I took. I wasn't able to take more photos because I almost threw up from how disturbingly disgusting the room was. I can't believe this hotel is open for business. False advertising anyone?? The walls were falling apart, the stove has never been cleaned with food and other unknown substances baked into the bottom of the stove and the burners, the sink and counter were being held up by one leaning piece of wood, the refrigerator had caked grime and mold, the carpet looked like someone rubbed feces everywhere, the towels in the bathroom were gray... I was in the room for about 90 seconds total and managed to snap a few photos before I left as fast as I could to talk to management about the room. To my dismay after telling the front desk person (who was very pleasant), their solution was to a) put us into another Extended Stay miles away, or b) possibly get someone to clean it in the morning. NO FRIGGIN WAY were we going to stay in that disgusting, unsafe hotel. I have yet to contact corporate directly regarding the experience. I can go on and on about how awful this hotel is.

Having stayed at this hotel in the past (and becoming unenchanted with the service & guests this hotel attracted), I was pleasantly surprised at how well they have improved. The new manager, Stella is far and above one of the nicest, most sincere people in the hotel industry that I have ever met. When I initially walked into the lobby upon check in, I was greeted by a young lady in the hallway who said \"Hi Christine\". When was the last time you went to check into a hotel and was called by your first name the minute you walked in? After we received our keys and came back downstairs to go get groceries, she asked how the room was? I had called the day before to confirm a deluxe room with 2 beds, and she reserved it specifically for us. She also advised us to let them know if we needed anything else during our stay. After our first night, we came downstairs to head out for the day and Stella asked how the night sleep was? Was it quiet enough, no noise after 10pm, no babies crying in the hallways? This hotel was surprisingly very quiet. It seems they have a no noise policy between 10pm - 8 am, which is greatly appreciated for those of us who wanted to sleep in a little. It also helps to alleviate extra noise since they don't have a housekeeper going from room to room knocking on doors like a traditional hotel. You can pay extra for daily housekeeping, but we like not having to worry about someone coming into our room every day. We were able to get extra sheets and towels form the front desk upon request. We felt right at home here and the room was large and comfy. The furniture was new and comfortable. Carpet was new & clean.It's really nice to have the full size kitchen. The kitchen is outdated, and I understand that they might not want to renovate it. It might be nice is they at least painted the outside of the cupboards or at minimal the inside shelves of cupboards and drawers. A fresh coat of paint would really refresh these areas because the insides of the cupboards and drawers were really kind of gross and dirty. We didn't use any utensils of dishes because of this. We bought paper plates and plastic utensils. The other suggestions that I would make is to tell the housekeeping staff to clean a little more diligently. The areas between bed/nightstand and the areas between dresser/wall had visible dirt and debris. These are areas that get overlooked in most  hotels, and they can really pay closer attention to these areas.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Manager_11525, General Manager at Extended Stay America - Detroit - Warren, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your stay.
