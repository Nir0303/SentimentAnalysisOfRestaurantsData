I hadn't been to one for years, so I popped in.  The lady serving reminded me of someone serving school dinners.  Despite my sunny mood, she didn't crack a smile.\nThe guacamole was an extra charge and really didn't look that appetizing, the chicken was precooked and she put it in the microwave - honestly I'd rather have had it cold, as it was with salad items.  I think I'll give it a miss next time, it's just not even close to some of the other sandwich style places.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-09-01T15:59:35-0400", "location_id": "4638174", "id": "306108722", "user": {"username": "Mercedes1185", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, Florida", "id": "34515"}}}]}
