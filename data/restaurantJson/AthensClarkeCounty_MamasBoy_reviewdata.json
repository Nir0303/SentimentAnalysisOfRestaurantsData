Two of us ordered the bacon-cheese egg scramble plate, one had the standard country breakfast plate and the last had a half order of the peach French toast and a fried chicken biscuit.  The biscuits are true \"cathead\" country biscuits.  One would be enough for breakfast.  Slightly crusty buttered outside and tender slightly salty fluffy interior.  Just like grandma in Mississippi would make.  My cheese grits were some of the best I have had.  Creamy and flavorful, the cheese was sprinkled on top.  They could have had a little more cheese or incorporated the cheese when cooking, but that is only a minor issue.  Egg scramble was just ok, mostly because I could not taste the cheese.  The peach French toast and fried chicken biscuit disappeared quickly by someone who rarely eats a cracker for breakfast, so both of those would be rated \"scrumptious\".

The cinnamon roll was HUGE and delicious. The chicken biscuit was 1,000x better than Chick-fil-A. We arrived around 9:30 am on a Saturday (non-game-day) morning and only had to wait 10 minutes (after being told 20-25 min.). What a wonderful experience!

We waited about 40 minutes on a Sunday and I would wait again! The tofu dish was so good. The scrambles were great. Biscuits were huge and so fluffy. Loved the idea of chocolate cake for breakfast. One of my favorites but have to go back to try it. Highly recommend this place. Was a local place too. Everyone knew each other. And was friendly.
