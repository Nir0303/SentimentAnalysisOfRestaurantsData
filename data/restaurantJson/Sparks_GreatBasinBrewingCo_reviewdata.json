Service was very lacking.  Finally able to order a bite to eat and a drink for each of us.  The food arrived well before the drinks and the drinks came out separately and slowly.  I ordered a Bloody Mary - nothing extraordinary - at least you wouldn't think.  When it finally showed up, I attempted to stir it with the \"celery\" but when I picked up that celery item, it literally drooped over my hand and formed a U shape - nice and fresh.  Also decorating the drink was other stale old pickles and peppers - they were gross.  That's when I noticed my Bloody Mary was dark brown....I thought, okay, I'll try it anyway.  Not sure what that was, but nasty.  So contact with the server was not an option since she was nowhere to be found.  Spoke to bartender who became insulted and stated that all the Bloody Mary drinks have stout in them.  Realizing this is a beer bar, I stated that I did not actually want a beer drink and he ultimately replaced it - again after quite some time and fulfilling everyone else's drink requests he could possibly have fulfilled first.  The beer ordered in the beginning was at least cold but was the very last thing we ended up getting and the food was mediocre at best.

When we arrived the short street had a variety of places to eat with an open air concert in session next to the restaurant.  We opted to bypass the nice patio for the quieter inside dining space. \n\nThe menu and beer selection were ample for a brewpub. I selected the Shepherd's Pie. They didn't skimp on the chunks of lamb meat. The Steak Fajita Wrap was the size of a rolled up newspaper, however the amount steak was on the light side. Cucumber Salad is unique and enjoyed as well. \n\nWe debated about getting the poppers, but SO glad we ordered the plate of open-faced version piled with cheese and bacon and lightly deep-fried. The Honey Jalepeno dipping sauce was the perfect companion, completing to heavenly appetizer experience. If you are a fan of this appy, you won't be disappointed! \n\nMy beer choice was the Icky IPA, a nice cross of a British style with a touch of American revved up hops. The wheat beer was excellent as well.\n\nThe service was very good even on a Friday evening. Our waiter had a great sense of humor and we are glad he strongly recommend the poppers.
