This is not like the big league museums in Indianapolis, st Louis or San Francisco, yet better than small ones all over the country, so I would say a four star rating. Unique exhibits like the water room, ball cannon, and handkerchief tubes were great, but the layout makes it so easy to lose sight of the kids running around between the rooms and exhibits. That's exactly what happened to my 2 year old. He was having so much fun, and ran around one exhibit to the next. When I went following him, he was gone from sight. Talk about a parents worst nightmare thinking your child went missing. I notified staff right away, who were awesome by locking the place down, giving a description out to all staff by walkie talkie, and checking every room/floor. After about 5 excruciating minutes, he was found riding the elevator! So a five star for the staff, with one huge caveat; the place needs to be child proofed by making sure the buttons aren't reachable to little ones, securing each room/entrance separately (gate?) and maybe eliminating blind spots if feasible. I know it's ultimately my responsibility as a parent, but multiple open rooms and an easy access front door is a flawed layout.
