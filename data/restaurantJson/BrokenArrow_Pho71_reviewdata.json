We were unsure if we were to seat ourselves or not, then finally a waitress advised us where to seat. We were given menu's. As I began looking at them, they had tape over a lot of the prices and new prices written on the tape. The waitress came and took our drink order, and when she she brought it back it was can's of soda. Then she took our app order. I ordered Goi Cuon Ga Nuong which is Fresh Spring rolls with Grilled Chicken. They were really good. They came with a sauce that was really sweet.  It was kinda overwhelming to them. I also ordered Pho Tai. It was good, I wanted to try the Basil that was provided and it had an overwhelming mint flavor to it. I would prefer the Pho Tai without the Basil, but with the Bean spouts, Cilantro, and Peppers. I decided to share the Bun Bo Nuong which is a Vermicelli Noodles with Grilled Beef and it was really good. The sauce was nice on all the noodles, veggies, and beef. I had asked the waitress for the Cafe  Sua Da which is a Vietnamese Ice Coffee to be brought with the ticket at the end of the meal to go. She brought it out right after she brought out the entree's. So, when I finally was able to drink it, sad to say it was watered down and I was unable to really taste it. Throughout the meal, the waitress was hard to find and we ended up running out of drinks. I had to share with my husband and my son ran out of his too. I was frustrated when getting the bill to find out that we were charged for each can of soda that we drank. It didn't specify that on the Menu and the waitress didn't inform us of that.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-29T12:25:12-0400", "location_id": "6915957", "id": "398937935", "user": {"username": "Jayme F", "user_location": {"name": "Claremore, Oklahoma", "id": "51267"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "VERY GOOD PHO", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51224-d6915957-r390190373-m11068-Pho_71-Broken_Arrow_Oklahoma.html#review390190373", "text": "Is our go to place for pho and other Vietnamese dishes they offer.

The sliced carrots, Daikon radish had not been marinated, no sauce or pate on the bun, little seasoning. \nThe place was empty when we came in at 11:30 but it filled up by noon with diners and carry out patrons.
