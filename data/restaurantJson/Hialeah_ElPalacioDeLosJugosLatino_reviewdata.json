Well I can attest to that statement. They certainly like to challenge how much food they can cram into that styrofoam container. The pork chops are as big as your face. The churrasco was lean and flavorful. And such a large quantity given. About $24 generously fed three people with quality choices. The options are plentiful! Seafood paella, salmon, shrimp, fried cod, fried pork belly, pork chops, ribs, roasted chicken, fried chicken wings, steak, any type of Cuban sandwich, and fresh juices! Don't worry if you don't speak Spanish, everyone there was very friendly and eager to have you try stuff. Would go back anytime I'm in the Miami area.
