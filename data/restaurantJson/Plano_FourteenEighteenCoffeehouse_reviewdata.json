You'll find a great one here with many flavoring choices.  Love trying something new?  This is the place!  Last month the \"purple haze\" was a delicious drink, infusing lavender into a latte.  The chai latte is exceptional, and the house brew is great. The Christmas Cookie latte is a wonderful holiday concoction that really did make the season bright.
