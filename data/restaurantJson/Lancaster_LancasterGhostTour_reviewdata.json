We arrived with 20 minutes to spare and drove through the intersection where the tour departs from 3x in a search for parking.  Finally entered a deck only to have a nightmare leaving after the tour.  But again, taking that out of the picture, the tour itself was enjoyable.  Angela was our guide, and she seemed very interested in the paranormal and was a decent storyteller.  It was an extremely hot and humid night out so if we could\u2019ve been more comfortable I might\u2019ve enjoyed the stories better- however obviously since the tour guides can\u2019t control the weather (haha), one has to endure the heat and humidity for a good ghost tale.  Also Lancaster seems like a \u201crough\u201d city compared to others we have visited in on our travels.  We saw countless homeless people on the streets, some begging for money, some just sleeping on the ground.  It was a bit disconcerting, but again, not in the control of the Ghost Tour- just be prepared with a response to frequent requests for money.  My 9 yo enjoyed the ghost stories on the tour and even had us holding her hand because she was a bit frightened at times.  The tour talked just a bit about the history of the area but mostly focused on stories of paranormal activity in Lancaster.  We aren\u2019t believers in that sort of thing and mainly went for the fun story telling element which didn\u2019t disappoint.  The tour lasted right at the promised amount of time (1.5 hours) and was entertaining- some stories more so than others.  The walk around town was a pleasant way to discover a new city and some of its quirks.  It was a bit overpriced for the experience, but would recommend to others in the area except that the parking situation was a nightmare and that definitely would affect my decision to do the tour again.
