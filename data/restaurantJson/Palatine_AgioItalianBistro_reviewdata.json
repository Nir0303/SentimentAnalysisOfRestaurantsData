Peel and eat shrimp, smoked salmon/capers/onions/cream cheese and mini bagels; a smattering of hot dishes, a carving station, some breakfast offerings, etc.  Omelets cooked back in the kitchen.  Desserts were OK; the light cheesecake squares with sliced almonds and the chocolate-covered strawberries were good.\nAll in all, it was just OK.  Some of the food was dry, some not even warm.  Not much different than what you could have found at most any $10-12 buffets.  Nothing comes to mind that really stood out.  Fresh, warm bread served at the table would have been nice.  Whipped butter would have been nice.  Side plates to put shrimp shells and/or the missing warm bread on would have been nice.  Fancy jellies would have been nice.\nThe Easter Champagne Brunch almost seemed like an after-thought.  I can imagine that on a regular dinner night out, the meal might be better than what we experienced today...maybe a little more personalized, a little fresher, a little warmer.  Service was OK.
