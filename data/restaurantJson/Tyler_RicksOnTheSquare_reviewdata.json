Iced tea and tax brought the bill up to just over $13.  The tomato sauce on the meatloaf was a little sweet, but everything was perfectly cooked and the service was quick and exceptional!

Accessible and in an interesting part of town.  The layout is spacious -- you are not elbow-to-elbow with other patrons.  Service was good.  Food was tasty -- you could tell the chef was experienced and made the effort to provide you with a good meal, well-presented.  Compared to FD's, it was very overpriced and not as sumptuous.  We started with the fried calamari.  It was overbreaded, seemed to be something fried out of a bag -- not house-made -- and was piled high -- on a big bed of lettuce.  Turns out it was a lettuce plate with some calamari.  Fortunately, it was not that tasty, so we really didn't miss having more.  Interestingly, they offer \"Ranch dressing, tartar sauce, or cocktail sauce\" -- another indicator it is something pre-packaged, not made on site.  I do NOT recommend the calamari.  As for entrees, we both opted for the specials.  My wife had the Sirloin topped with crab and I had the Mahi.  She could not finish her meal and I was left a tad hungry.  Her steak was cooked to perfection and my mahi was a shade undercooked and not particularly savory.  The accompanying rice made up for it, though -- a uniquely concocted blend of spices and fflavors.  \n\nAs an aside, we are foodies and music lovers, but, for the first time my life, I almost had to ask the server to have the manager change the music.  After the third consecutive song about \"I just wanna sex you\" or \"Ride my thaaang\", I looked around at other families eating there and actually said to my wife, \"If one more of these songs comes on, I will call for the manager.\"  It didn't, so I didn't.  Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding saved the day.  Still, if you have a family eatery and cater to a wide range of customers, there is no need to go so \"urban\" -- actually so base.  \n\nWe had read the reviews, noted the high ranking, and looked forward to stopping at Ricks.  We left feeling it was overpriced and overrated.

I drove by Ricks while getting to know downtown. Turns out this night they had a band planning and it was so much FUN! When you walk in, there is a big dining room on the left. The bar is straight as you walk in and the stage with the band playing is through a doorway on the right. Loved that when you walk in to see the band you are on the balcony and the band is below you. And if you look up you will see the sky/stars since the roof is open! The band was so much fun...the saxophone and trombone guys walked and danced throughout the the crowd while playing. Really fun night and we will come back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-12T06:02:07-0500", "location_id": "510081", "id": "354786472", "user": {"username": "JLGlenn", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
