There is really no info on the menu about how these are prepared, except that they are split (which is the only good thing about then). Every restaurant that I have ordered crab legs in (and there have been many), they are served steamed (or maybe simply boiled). These were either broiled or grilled, which might have been okay if they were done plain, but they were greasy, buttery (which made them too rich for my taste). They were also very salty and fishy. I felt so disappointed. For a $29 entree, this didn't deliver. I'll stick with crab legs from Marblehead or lump crab cocktail from Youells or Kingfish. They are much more to my liking. There was a special side of red roasted potatoes, those were fine.\n\nMy husband had a Ribeye and Crabcake combo. I guess they were okay, but he said we wouldn't be rushing to return to this restaurant. Maybe that's because they forgot his second side of asparagus totally (menu says the combo meals are served with two sides). Kids were happy with their meals.\n\nThe Ladies' room... Ugh. I sent my preschooler into one of the stalls, the middle one was set up for Handicap, so I used the one on the other end. It had an all-the-way through crack in the toilet seat. It seams like that is something that could be EASILY replaced. It struck me as laziness that it was left like that.\n\nLeaving the restaurant, I followed a pathway to the right (looked to be the quickest way to the back parking lot), and I stepped on a loose/unfinshed (?) slate step that shifted underfoot. That should have been roped off or a cone alerting customers NOT to walk that way.

Came with 3 sauces marinara, a pesto which we didn't like , it just doesn't go together and a delicious Thai chili sauce. The thai chili sauce they use to make a shrimp entree as we found out later that we will come back to try as the sauce is really good.  my husband ordered the mahi mahi which was encrusted with almonds and a white chocolate beurre sauce..  although the fish was very good and flaky the sauce was way too sweet and over powered the fish.  I had the Caribbean jerk tuna.  The seasoning was good not too heavy with just the right kick.  Overall the quality of the food was good.  The place is rather large and can accommodate big groups, i don't know why there were so few people.
