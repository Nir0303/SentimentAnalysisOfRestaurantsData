Both were delicious! \nThe desserts we got were the chocolate cake and the butterscotch pudding with salted caramel topping. If I had to choose between the two, I don't think I could. They were both great. \nService was attentive without being intrusive. Love the decor and ambiance of the place. Overall, a very positive experience and I would return without hesitation!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-07T08:27:04-0400", "location_id": "5801378", "id": "415751261", "user": {"username": "sunnygrl98", "user_location": {"name": "WI", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Business Dinner for 25 at Del Frisco's Grille", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55857-d5801378-r414544806-m11068-Del_Frisco_s_Grille-Fort_Worth_Texas.html#review414544806", "text": "We had an incredible dinner at Del Frisco's Grille.  The food was excellent and the service excellent too.  We had a set menu since there were 25 of us.  I would recommend everything we had.  They started us out with ahi tacos and flatbread with sun dried tomatoes and pepperoni.  That was followed by the house salad with  2 thick strips of bacon on top.  The 3 main course options were filet mignon (which I had, which was cooked just right), parmesan-lemon sole and simply roasted chicken.  They served roasted asparagus and hand mashed potatoes with our entrees.  The desserts were perfect end courses.  We had lemon doberge cake (it was very moist) and warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  Everyone walked out full with big smiles on their faces.
