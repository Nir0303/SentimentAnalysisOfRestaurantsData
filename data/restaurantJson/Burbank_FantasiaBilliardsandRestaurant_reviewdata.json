In Burbank you have Hooters. That was my first try but for some reason place was empty, doors locked 30 mins before main event with 50 people outside.  I will never go to Buffalo Wild Wings again so that's out of the question.  I remembered Fantasia having a poster so we walked there.  Paid like $7 more than Hooters was asking but worth it.  Found bar High table, reasonable priced cold beer and multiple screens.  Crowd was more mature than Hooters/Barneys/Wild Wings but in a good way, no Fat Frat boys in Kobe or NFL Jerseys, rather Filipino mail man or dialysis nurse types with penguin or polo logo on shirt and pleated Khakis.

Since it was busy the waiter came often enough as she could so no complaints there.  It was funny though they ran out of glasses so I couldn't get water and had to buy bottled water.\n\nThe food was your typical bar food...it was decent.
