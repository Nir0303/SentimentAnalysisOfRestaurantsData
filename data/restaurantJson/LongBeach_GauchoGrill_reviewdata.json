Both our previous meals had been so good that we each ordered exactly the same again (yes, I know - not very adventurous).  My wife's skewers were served this time with the chicken so underdone that it was deep pink and cold on the inside and she of course asked the waiter to change it for a skewer properly cooked.  The waiter took her entire plate and returned after ten minutes with chicken dry, hard as a rock and pretty much inedible.\n\nMeanwhile, my chicken came equally dry and tough, but looking at my wife's raw chicken I decided to make the best of it.  The final straw came when the bill came with a charge for three beers, instead of the two that we were served.  When I pointed this out to the waiter he pretended to not understand and brought over the manager/owner.  He apologized for the overcharge and for the whole meal but didn't offer anything further (which we certainly didn't want anyway).\n\nSo it seems that you take your chances at the Gaucho.

They had a very nice selection of drinks (I had the excellent sangria), and a variety of specialties.  The appetizers and salad were really tasty, and my skirt steak was very delicious.  We also enjoyed the dessert flan.  This is an excellent restaurant if you like Argentinian food (or want to try it).
