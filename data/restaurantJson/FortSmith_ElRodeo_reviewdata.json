This is REAL Mexican and in a Mexican neighborhood.  lots of seafood and weird dishes but i stick to the basics.  they give you free cheese dip... which is kind of like cheese soup... but it's good.   they use better cheese in their enchiladas, not the white stuff.   pleasant interior.  they grill the steak and chicken and chop it.

Real authentic Mexican delights. Service is courteous and fast. Prices are very reasonable.
