We were super hungry after waiting about an hour at RMV. The registry guy said the best place for lunch is Marko's Food Truck. Enough said and we were off. Simply stated, we were wowed!!! It was one of the best lunches we have had in a long time. Great quality FRESH food, fair price and huge portions. The herb seasoned fries are to die for (my favorite). There are a couple of picnic tables for sitting outside. We will gladly drive out of our way for many more lunches there! Search them out...it's well worth it!!!
