You could easily make a whole meal just off these. We got a standard cheese and a cheesy pesto, and they were both amazing. Even the kids went nuts over these things. Think of it as the garlic cheese bread you always get from traditional pizza places, expect these are actually good. By the time I remembered to get a photo of the garlic chips, they were already gone. I highly recommend getting these on every visit.\n\nWe had a hard time deciding on what to get, so we each got the small personal pizza size, which was plenty big enough with six slices. The kids got a small cheese pizza to share, which was eight slices, and that was a perfect size as well.\n\nI got a pizza called the Belly Bomber. It was to-die for. Once it was all devoured, I wanted more. I wish I had ordered a standard small so I could take some home and have it the next day. It was simply dynamite. If you've never been to this little place in the heart of Folsom, you don't know what you're missing. \n\nIt's right across the street from Chicago Fire, so I'm not sure how the competition is treating them, but it seems like they've been there a long time.
