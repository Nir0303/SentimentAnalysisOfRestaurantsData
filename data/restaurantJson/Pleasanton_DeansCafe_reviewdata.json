I saw the reviews about Dean's and thought I would give it a try.  Dean's is located on Main St in Pleasanton.  It looks like an old fashion diner when you step inside.  There are two rooms with booths lining the walls and tables in the center.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  When I got the menu, I was amazed at the selection of omelets (3 pages)!  Anything you could think of.  I didn't bring a big enough apetite for a 3 or 4 egg omelet so I settled for 2 eggs over easy,sourdough toast (dry) and hash browns.  The eggs were cooked to order and the toast came without butter which doesn't always happen at other restaurants.  The hash browns were a bit too greasy for me.  Their coffee is delicious!  I would definitely recommend Dean's for breakfast.  I happened to go on a weekday so there was no problem getting seated, but I can imagine how hard it must be to get a seat on the weekends!
