It had ample amount of meat, and was large enough to be bulging and hard to hold.  It was very good. There were so many sandwiches on the menu that looked very tasty, I'll have to return and try a different one next time.  I also picked up one of the chocolate chip cookies near the cash register.  It was very good, not too dry, and seemed very fresh. The only disappointment for me is there isn't fresh brewed iced tea.  They have the Gold Peak tea which is a pre-brewed Coca cola product.  What they need is Lipton Fresh brewed Tropical tea to be the best sandwich shop around.  The other problem with the beverages is that Coke machine with all the varieties in one place.  Only one person can get a beverage at a time, and when you put your cup in to get ice, the soda spigot drips on your hand.  The Mission Viejo location is small, about 10 tables and many of them have their own TV.  They all seem to be on the same channel, so I don't know if you can choose your preferred programming.  We sat on the patio, and didn't realize that there are no speakers for when they announce that your food is ready.  Eventually, one of the servers came outside and asked if anyone with my name was sitting out there, even though all the patio tables were occupied except one, it seemed like they let our food sit quite awhile before seeing if we were outside.  I will definitely be back, probably take a sandwich to go and get a beverage elsewhere. We got three sandwiches, three drinks, and three extras (chips or cookies) and the cost was $45.
