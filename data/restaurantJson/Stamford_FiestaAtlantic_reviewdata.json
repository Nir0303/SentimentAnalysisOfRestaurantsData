So, don't take them lightly when they tell you what time you going to be eating. In addition, the delivery personnel feels like they doing you a favor on bring you the food 2 hours later, so please don't forget to tip them 20% for this fact. My main point to Fiesta is your food is great, you have a good thing going for you... Don't mess it up if you don't have the proper staff to deliver. Just as an F.Y.I Chanel Rodas (OWNER)...

The restaurant's ambience is simple but clean; service was very attentive; and there was a constant flow of enthusiastic patrons. There are both booths and open tables for seating.  Unfortunately FA is only licensed to serve wine and beer, so alas, no Pisco Sours! But that was our only disappointment of the evening, as there was an ample supply  of cold Peruvian beer and a drinkable jug Chardonnay.\n\nThe portions are more than abundant.  For starters we tried the ceviches (based on fish, mixed seafood, or shrimp), and all three preparations were presented on a large plate accompanied by yucca, camote, separated choclo kernels and corn nuts and were perfectly marinated; the aji en gallina served over a large boiled potato, was both rich and tasty; and the choclo and white cheese appetizer featured a large corn cob with the huge, separated kernels.  All left us feeling we had almost had enough for a full meal. Hot, fresh bread was served with a tasty, zesty in-house aji sauce. \n\nFor the main course, their speciality and \"most ordered\" plates are the different saltados, chicken, seafood, and, of course, lomo, accompanied by french fries and mountains of rice. No question these dishes were prepared home-style. The other main dish ordered was the milanesa de carne, which was a bit over-breaded, and one savvy diner ordered an appetizer portion of aji en gallina for a tasty, and more than sufficient, main dish.  \n\nBy the time we got to dessert, there was little room, but we shared two orders of a home made tres leches and it was the perfect end to a very enjoyable evening.  Although this restaurant is one of three Peruvian restaurants under the same owner, one does not get any impression that this is a \"chain\" operation.  Service was attentive and personable.  The one observation I would make to potential customers is that many plates may be shared and you will still come away filled to the brim.  At the end of the evening, each of the three couples said they would definitely return, as will I, having just finished a lunch comprised of the leftovers....sabroso!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-29T15:28:49-0400", "location_id": "3791398", "id": "231704732", "user": {"username": "oystertravels", "user_location": {"name": "Rowayton, Connecticut", "id": "33907"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-04", "title": "Might be the best value in Stamford", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d3791398-r201469456-m11068-Fiesta_Atlantic-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review201469456", "text": "Recently joined friends for a \"groupon\" meal at Fiesta Atlantic. Its located in the heart of Downtown Stamford a couple of doors down from the Palace Theatre.  It might be one of the best kept secrets (if it is a secret) in Stamford.  The food was very reasonably priced (even without the coupon) and abundant.  The meal begins with bread and \"yellow\" sauce.The sauce is incredible. We ordered appetizers including Calamari (delicious) and a dish called Aji de Gallina, which is shredded chicken mixed with a mildly spicy cream sauce served over potatoes. Outstanding. (could have been a meal itself). For the main course, I ordered the Lomo Saltado which they claim is the most requested dish.  It is a big plate of pepper steak strips sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and Peruvian seasonings, served over fries, with white rice on the side.  Fries and rice you ask?  Oh yes!  Fries and Rice.  $12.  Delicious!  There is also a chicken or shrimp version.  Oh, and did I mention the Sangria?  Best I have ever tasted.  Service was also great.  If you are looking for something a little bit different, with great food and great service, give it a try.  Oh, and take some friends.  They will be impressed that you know about this hidden gem.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-04-16T15:01:32-0400", "location_id": "3791398", "id": "201469456", "user": {"username": "jc1traveler", "user_location": {"name": "Connecticut", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": null, "title": "Mediocre Peruvian", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d3791398-r200076426-m11068-Fiesta_Atlantic-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review200076426", "text": "Went there for dinner last night excited to get some Peruvian chicken with aji sauce. They ran out of chicken! How does a Peruvian restaurant run out of chicken? Chicken is what they do! \n\nI was forced to get the Lomo Saltado and even though it was good, I was disappointed about the chicken. \n\nWe ordered two orders of the Peruvian corn choclo con queso and it was disgusting. I didn't know what it was before hand so I guess it's my fault but just a warning to someone who has never had it, this is my like regular corn. The corn is huge and tastes and feels like rubber. \n\nThe ceviche especial was delicious according to my brother. \n\nService was terrible and our waitress did not speak English. \n\nThey had Christmas decorations still up in April. \n\nI will not be returning.
