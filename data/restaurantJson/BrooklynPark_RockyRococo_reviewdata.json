They make a whole wheat crust pan pizza that tastes delicious. It is made in a square pan and my favorite is pepperoni. You can dine in or take out or a convenient drive thru. They have coupons in the store and there are daily specials excluding Sunday. They are open every day of the week. Check out their website for offers.

The dough is slightly sweet, the sausage savory and with a slight tang of spice, the pepperoni large, the mushrooms, fresh.  Eat it with their cheesy bread.
