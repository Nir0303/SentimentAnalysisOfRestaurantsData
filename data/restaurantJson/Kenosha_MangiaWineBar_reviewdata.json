Alas, I am writing this review about one hour after leaving Mangia. My wife and I ordered the Calamari, the Gnocchi and the Sea Scallops.\n\nCalamari is our benchmark dish in any restaurant that offers it. We've had it, and loved it, all over the world. The odor of spoiled fish preceded the arrival of the dish. I thought, no way, nobody would serve that. It can't be our food. In the 1930's there was an expression \"You stink on ice.\" The meaning is that the person's odor was so offensive that even attempting to keep the item fresh on ice could not mask the odor. This Calamari was that bad. It was \"find the spot in the harbor that has no flow at all and collects all the garbage\" bad.\n\nOne bite was all we needed. It didn't even stay on the table long enough to take a picture of it. \n\nThe manager was quite accommodating and professional. She stated however, that she had checked in the calamari herself just that morning. There is no question, this squid was spoiled. Let's assume the manager did check the items in this morning. I can only assume that the squid was left in the August heat and spoiled after it arrives at Mangia. \n\nThis item did not appear on our bill.\n\nMy $39 Sea Scallops arrived. Picture attached. When the dish came before me I smelled the spoiled Calami. I suspect they were on the same grill and the scallops picked up some of the contamination. The smell and taste of spoilage was present but much diminished. \n\nThe scallops were not seared, but burned. The flavor of the ruined exterior likewise ruined the flavor of the scallops. The exterior completed dominated the flavor. One small sliver for me. One small sliver for my wife. The dish went back.\n\nThe manager offered me anything else on the menu. I declined. I decided it was safer to skip dinner than to try another dish at Mangia.\n\nMy wife's $18 Gnocchi was a surprisingly small serving. French restaurant small. She did not enjoy it, but she did eat it.\n\nThe manager removed the scallops from the bill and also, generously removed the gnocchi from the bill as well. We paid only for a beer and soda.\n\nDespite the awful experience with the food we left a nearly 100 percent tip as the service was excellent.

We are extremely disappointed to hear you will not be returning or recommending us. Upon arrival you stated that you had a reservation for 3 at 10:45 on Easter Sunday. You stated the reservation was made online. We looked for the reservation under the name you provided but were unable to find a reservation with the provided name. We asked to see a confirmation but you were unable to provide us with that information. Being one of our busiest days of the year we stated that we could seat you immediately in the lounge as we were fully booked in our dining room. You denied this request. After this occurred, our owner stated, \"Just give us a minute please and we will work something out for you.\" As we tried to figure something out you refused to wait and your party decided to leave ignoring our persistence that we would work this out for you. We are incredibly sorry that you were frustrated by this situation but we were trying as hard as we possibly could to work something out for you. The following week (April 3rd) we noticed that we had a reservation for Brunch at the same time, same guest count, under the same name you provided us. It looks like this may have been an error made by whoever made the reservation online from your party. Had you presented us with a confirmation number we would have been able to detect this error right away. We understand that this was a frustrating situation for you and your party but we would love to have you back in the restaurant and would treat you with respect and hospitality. We hope that you decide to change your mind and give us a try again.", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-04-08T10:19:42-0400", "id": "362581425"}, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-27T10:12:57-0400", "location_id": "517532", "id": "359060182", "user": {"username": "Traci P", "user_location": {"name": "Kenosha, Wisconsin", "id": "60003"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Wonderful restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60003-d517532-r357869025-m11068-Mangia_Wine_Bar-Kenosha_Wisconsin.html#review357869025", "text": "My ex-son in law used to be the cook.
