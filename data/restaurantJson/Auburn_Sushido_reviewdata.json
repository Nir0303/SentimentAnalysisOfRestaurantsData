A small bowl of miso soup and a small plate of edamame came with the menu, which was nice.\n\nThe nigiri prices seemed high for \"one piece\" but in fact the pieces of precisely cut fish that came with the special nigiri lunch were more than twice the size of sashimi cuts I've had elsewhere, so in the end represented good value.  I particularly like that the little dipping bowls, wasabi, pickled ginger, and soy sauce were all in containers already at the table you may concoct your own sauce to your own taste.  \n\nIn my experience nigiri comes with the fish (etc) draped over and pressed into sushi rice.  My lunch came on a flat wooden \"boat\" with two slabs each of three (chef's) choices of excellent sashimi attractively assembled and the rice in a ball at the end.  Fine with me, but different than my expectations.  \n\nI didn't think the hot sake was particularly good for the price, but it complemented the food as hot sake does.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-05-28T10:40:41-0400", "location_id": "4839713", "id": "275341852", "user": {"username": "SkykomishBob", "user_location": {"name": "Olympia, Washington", "id": "58653"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Good food, a little pricey on sushi", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30274-d4839713-r275193654-m11068-Sushido-Auburn_Washington.html#review275193654", "text": "This was a lovely establishment.
