When picking these items up, there was no place to park in front of the store, so I had to park about a block away behind it.  It was pouring rain when I went in to get the items and I knew I couldn't carry both the enormous cake and the 24 cupcakes back to the car by myself, so, even though there were quite a few customers waiting to be helped, the manager (sorry, didn't get her name) was gracious enough to help me get the items back to my car (we went out the back door to shorten the trip) so I wouldn't have to make two trips.  The cake and cupcakes were tasty, delicious and substantial (my preference vs. fluffy cake), and were designed just as I had requested. It was a hectic, but gratifying experience and I'm happy to know they are there for the next event that calls for a professional and yummy dessert.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-05-19T14:23:24-0400", "location_id": "7990876", "id": "273146700", "user": {"username": "Boodashark", "user_location": {"name": "Colorado", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Happy Cakes, Rates!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33527-d7990876-r271895201-m11068-Happy_Cakes-Longmont_Colorado.html#review271895201", "text": "Happy Cakes excites your tastebuds with real butter, cream, eggs, with moist unique cupcakes with out of this world icings!
