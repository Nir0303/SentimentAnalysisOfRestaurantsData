We wanted a booth as we had our 4 year old grandson with us and it would be easier to sit at. When we asked if we could get a booth cleaned the very rude waitress said they were very busy and trying.  We just told her to nevermind then and sat at table 1. We then had to wait for someone to acknowledge that we had even sat down. Another waitress finally noticed us as she was clearing another table and said she could drop menus with us but did not leave us a child's menu. We then sat awhile longer before another waitress finally waited on us. She was the most friendly person that we experienced out of the 3 during our visit. She had only worked there 2 weeks though, so being new she didn't know much about the menu. When we finished I let our waitress know that the turkey on my chefs salad had a funny taste to it and either it was old or a brand that didn't taste that great, like real chemical like or something. Her boss must have heard my comment as the waitress came back with our credit card and receipt and told me her boss said the turkey had just been sliced. Either way, the food was edible, but nothing to write home about. My dad suggested we stop there on our way to Billings as he's been there before and went to school with the Lincoln kids in Libby. Needless to say, we won't go back and won't recommend it. The silver dollars are cool, but it's a tourist trap. Don't waste your time or money.
