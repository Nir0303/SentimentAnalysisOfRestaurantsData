So excited to find Gamble Garden.  I called and found out that they are open today.  The lady on the phone sounded friendly enough so i was excited to see it today, November 11, 2015. When we arrived, there weren't any signs to say enter here.  Ok.  Went into the house, a lady was talking loudly on the phone.  Found out later that she just came to tune the piano.  We wandered from room to room and heard yet another lady talking, this one was in the office with another lady behind the desk.  I said to the lady behind the desk, 'Excuse me, we are visiting.  And like to view the house.  How do we do that?'  I was thinking that there was information or a docent on site though their website said nothing about docents.  She said, 'you just walk around the first floor.' Wow, i have never been to a historic house that was run like this.  She didn't even say, hope you enjoy your visit.  I went back to the foyer and looked more closely at the literature they had out and found a one page write-up about the architecture of the house that you can not remove from the table.  They displayed a hardcover book for sale about the house and later i did find the book on a book stand in one of the room and read a lot of it. Must say the book is lightweight on historic info.  It would have been a better experience if there was a self-guided tour information sheet that gave more information about the house, about the left-over pictures on the wall, info on the fire places, pictures of the house in by-gone years ... Anything!  I would have been happy to make a donation or pay for a tour with some real information ... \n\nInstead, the only word i can think of the treatment i got was 'snooty'. At least it felt like that and that they really didn't care for you to come.    \n\nThe garden was nice.  You could apparently just come and have lunch or sit or stand or meditate.  It looked like a nice get-away. At least the plants were labelled.  But not much else.  I could have seen the same plants in a well stock nursery. \n\nFor whatever fund raising or support the property got from the city or regular people, some of it could have been used to better serve people who came to visit the house.  Perhaps that was not the focus.  Like another reviewer said, maybe they just wanted to rent the place out for lavish events.  So disappointed! \n\nIf you are not into using the grounds as a park... And you love history, you will feel cheated somehow of an opportunity to get in touch with Palo Altos' past, all because how poorly run this is.
