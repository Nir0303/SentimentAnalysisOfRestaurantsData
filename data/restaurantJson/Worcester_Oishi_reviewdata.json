We got there and there was a family at another table already.\nThere were only 2 people behind the counter. We were seated immediately but then we waited some time before someone came to take the orders from the other family and then someone else came to take our order. We ordered chirashi, #6 maki sushi, unadon, a couple of salmon rolls. We waited some more before the salads came. \n\nWe noticed they were very short on staff.  Just 2 people waiting the tables/taking orders and making the food.  Although they were very nice, the service was horrendously slow. \n\nThe portions were pretty small including the salads.  The chirashi came with a few slices of fish on top of a thin bed of rice on a small plate. The unadon usually comes with hot rice - not sushi rice - and with some turnips.  The #6 maki rolls were ok as were the salmon rolls. The miso soup was too salty - there was a lump of miso paste at the bottom of the bowl so it seems like one bowl of soup was made for the order instead of scooping it out of a previously made pot of soup. For the amount of food given the prices were not cheap either.\n\nThe green tea was made with tea bags and my husband said the tea was the best thing we ate all night.\n\nWe've eaten so much better sushi in other places.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-20T18:49:30-0400", "location_id": "4418048", "id": "312221508", "user": {"username": "PrisMiko", "user_location": {"name": "New York", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Great Lunch!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41952-d4418048-r208060138-m11068-Oishi-Worcester_Massachusetts.html#review208060138", "text": "We just stopped in for lunch as we work downtown and have walked by this place many times.
