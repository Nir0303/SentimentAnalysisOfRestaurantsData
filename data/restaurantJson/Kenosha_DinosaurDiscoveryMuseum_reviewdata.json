So, when we came to the streetcar stop, we got off and headed to the museum.  In front, are the dinosaur statues which always make for good photos with the kids.  The exhibit floor is small, but it was especially perfect for smaller kids.  The exhibits are well thought out and informative and all of us found it interesting.  We were told about the kids activity center in the basement, so we headed down there to check it out and there were a couple of activities for the kids, as well as a viewing area of their laboratory or work area.  While we were downstairs, one of the volunteers, Mason, came out and was very personable and friendly and entertained the kids with a variety of bones, replicas and teeth.  They really enjoyed Mason and he is a definite asset to the museum.  Though the museum is free, they do ask for a donation.

It was a beautiful building and we were welcomed by a really neat statue of a Dilophosaurus standing outside of it. The admission was free with a \u201csuggested\u201d donation of three dollars which we paid before looking over some of the fossils featured in the same foyer. For those willing to take the time to read the stories behind these specimens, it provided a fascinating glimpse of creatures that once lived in the North America West/Southwest some 65 million plus years ago. Ironically, I\u2019d visited that region a couple of months earlier and most of their museums offered fossil casts while Kenosha boasted many authentic pieces. We entered a large room that served as the main dinosaur attraction. It claimed to have the largest collection of meat-eating dinosaurs on display and I, for one, believe them. Aside from the more commonly seen T-Rex and Allosaurus, they also showcased much rarer dino casts of such as Carnotaurus and Suchomimus. If you don\u2019t recognize any of these names don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re kids probably do. Amid the two-legged terrors are fun and informative signage that offers amazing insights to a family of dinosaurs that likely branched into our modern day birds. This attraction is definitely tailor-made for dino-loving kids and those of us adults who are still kids at heart. I think if you go in with the intention of being entertained you may be disappointed but if your goal is to learn something new then you\u2019ll likely be entertained. All in all, a free and fun way to spend the afternoon.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-02T12:07:18-0400", "location_id": "1903519", "id": "413994188", "user": {"username": "Dave F", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "very  boring", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60003-d1903519-r412908288-m11068-Dinosaur_Discovery_Museum-Kenosha_Wisconsin.html#review412908288", "text": "theres nothing  worth  seeing there   its a waste  of time  it takes about five minutes too walk the place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-30T14:34:26-0400", "location_id": "1903519", "id": "412908288", "user": {"username": "Donna C", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "great Local Venue", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60003-d1903519-r412468924-m11068-Dinosaur_Discovery_Museum-Kenosha_Wisconsin.html#review412468924", "text": "great local place to take the kids or to meander with a friend.
