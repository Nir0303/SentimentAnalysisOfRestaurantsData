Without it, I am useless. Most mornings you'll find me seeking out a large black iced coffee so that I can function. Recently I found myself in Gulfport early one Sunday and I discovered this PJ's. \n\nPJ's is a chain well known to New Orleanians. It is very fitting that there is one on the gulf coast as I'd guess half the residents hail from Louisiana. Compared to other locations, this PJ's is larger than most. It's located in the historic part of old Gulfport and the building has a lot of charm. There are lots of places to sit and it appeared to be a great place to do some work if I was so inclined.\n\nThe coffee here was consistent with what you find at other locations. My iced coffee was smooth with the hint of bitterness I enjoy. Service was friendly, but there was only one employee working when we arrived. While my iced coffee was easy to make, the kids' fru fru drinks took a bit longer. Had there been another employee it could of sped up the process.\n\nThis is a solid place to get coffee in Gulfport.
