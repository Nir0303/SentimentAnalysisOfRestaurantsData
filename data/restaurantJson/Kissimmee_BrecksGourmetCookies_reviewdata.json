Friends and neighbors always wait for him to make cookies. But Breks is THE BEST and if anything put my husbands cookies to shame, As a side note he does not read my reviews and I am hopeful he will not know that I was cheating on him with other cookies!!!  I had Key Lime pie cookie was best of the, The Peanut butter with PB chips in them were sensational. The Red Velvet cookie was chocolaty goodness, which NEVER happens in red velvet. They are supposed to taste like chocolate but never do somehow. The chocolate chip cookie was classic, but I have not yet tried the Cheesecake or the Oatmeal Raisin.  They are so sinfully delicious I am both mad and glad they are just down the street from me.
