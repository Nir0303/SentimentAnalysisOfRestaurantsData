On Sunday, June 19th. My family and I, decided to have Father\u2019s Day dinner at Saddle Ranch Chop House in Costa Mesa. This was my first father\u2019s day, so we were pretty excited. I made a reservation, but we had to wait about 10 minutes (which was not bad). We were told by a hostess, that the reason why we had to wait was because there was not enough servers that day. Everything was going fine, we could see that our waiter (Matt Donahue) was running around doing the best he could. There was a \u201cManager in training\u201d in a light blue shirt just walking around mostly. We asked the \u201cmanager in training\u201d to get a few items which he did, but he never asked if we needed anything else. Our family was waiting for our check for approximately 20 minutes, finally when we got our check they took off some drinks because we were waiting so long. The new total bill was $201.00\nThe issue came when we tried to pay, we waited around for 10-15 minutes when we decided to try and pay at the bar. The bartender said he could not take my payment and that we needed to go to the hostess. The hostess gave the payment to the \u201cManager in training\u201d, we explained to him that we wanted to pay $46.00 in cash, $100.00 to be put on our credit card and the rest to be put on our sister\u2019s credit card. The \u201cmanager in training\u201d, goes and hunts down our server Matt, who was in the bar area grabbing 2 drinks to take to a different table. Mind you, our server is serving several tables and serving drinks. We waited by the bar and asked the \u201cManager in training\u201d if we should go wait at the table, he replied \u201cyes\u201d. \nMatt comes back with 2 receipts slips, 1 for $100.00 and the other for $101.00. What happened to the $46.00 cash? My family and I go back to the \u201cManager in training\u201d and he says I remember you giving me cash, let me go get the server. Matt comes back and says \u201coh yes, you gave me cash, how much was it?\u201d All of sudden the General Manager Chris DeFiore comes out and doesn\u2019t say much or even apologize for any of what\u2019s happened so far after explain the entire situation to him. At this point we are bothered because no one is helping the server out to assist us, everyone is just standing around and no one is apologizing for the inconvenience. We can\u2019t believe that the managers are not assisting the server. Instead of trying to solve it themselves, they pull him away from what he is doing so that he can fix the problem. My family and I asked for their corporate number. \nMr. DeFiore says \u201cit\u2019s on my card, the 949-287-4652 and press 0\u201d. I said no, I want corporates number, I don\u2019t want the number to this location, I am asking for Corporates. Number. Mr. DeFiore repeats himself with the same answer over and over. I called on my cell phone and sure enough it\u2019s not corporates Number, but instead the number for that specific location. Mr. DeFiore takes out his own cell phone and calls the phone number then proceeds to walk to the back towards the employee\u2019s area. At this point, we now have 4 other employee\u2019s looking for corporate\u2019s number. I mentioned that it would be the same location that they would contact HR, an employee says I don\u2019t know that number and walked away. \nFinally the general manager reappears and says \u201cso what is that you guys want\u201d we told him that we just want the cash back so that they don\u2019t mess up the transaction any further. After Matt gives us the cash back we inform Mr. DeFiore that we cannot believe the lack of professionalism that he has shown and overall customer service from everyone that day. Mr. Defiore then replied \u201cI think you guys are being irate and I am going to have to ask you to leave\u201d. There was no reason for us to be irate over trying to get our missing cash and Corporates number. My family and my 9 month old baby was with us, so there would be no reason to allow anyone to get us irate. I was really taken back and offended by what the general manager commented to my family and I. We assured him that we were not irate and that we were just wanting corporates number. Finally, the General Manager was able to give us Corporates number and so did 2 other employees one of which who was our server Matt who googled it for us on his own phone.  I have never been in a situation like this, it totally ruined our night and made us feel like we were being mistreated by Mr. Defiore who personally attacked us by calling us irate and threatening to kick us out. \nWe walked out to greet the rest of our family and again and the server Matt came out to apologize. He freely gave us his name and said he was overwhelmed, with all the tables and no help. We told him that we understood that he was doing the best he could and the manager should have stepped up and helped him with his tables. \nI was really upset and disappointed that our father\u2019s day ended that way. What\u2019s worse, is that as I mentioned earlier that it was my family\u2019s first ever. \n\nMr. Chris DeFiore  should remember, he is a reflection of all Saddle Ranch locations. He needs to learn to be courteous, respectful and sincere. Mr. Chris DeFiore should have apologized for not having enough staff and given the Corporate Number right away, my family and I should not have been put through all that. It was completely unnecessary and uncalled for being treated that way. \n\nAn update to this since I filed a complaint with the BBB, the business is stating that they offered us a $100 gift card which was not true. The fact that they think that a gift card would solve this issue, without even an apology shows the lack of professionalism from the company as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-25T14:43:28-0400", "location_id": "4766002", "id": "396954383", "user": {"username": "WALTER_M77", "user_location": {"name": "Orange County, California", "id": "659482"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "The Portions R Huge", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32253-d4766002-r394844550-m11068-Saddle_Ranch_Chop_House-Costa_Mesa_California.html#review394844550", "text": "We decided to stop at this restaurant after seeing it on the streets..Great choice.

The truffle Mac and cheese was good too. For desert we shared the cotton candy tower and got it comped for the birthday boy. Overall the service was okay, food was good, and I like the ambience. They need to do better with bussing the tables though. We sat there for a while with empty and dirty dishes on our table.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-13T20:09:02-0500", "location_id": "4766002", "id": "347495700", "user": {"username": "Cheyenne P", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Lovely SoCal Setting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32253-d4766002-r335570437-m11068-Saddle_Ranch_Chop_House-Costa_Mesa_California.html#review335570437", "text": "We had a really good evening here on our last night in Costa Mesa.

Visited on Halloween night, so I believe the staff was probably not their \"A-team\", While waiting for the rest of our group to arrive, ordered drinks. Took 15 minutes for drinks to arrive...via being clutched closely to the chest of the server (no tray). One of the drinks was a martini that I'm sure part of ended up on the server's top. My margarita was very average, the Mai Tai looks good. Next we were seated with our group. Ordered wine, chardonnay and pinot grigio, two glasses of red wine showed up, being brought by a gentleman identifying himself as some level of manager. Ordered food, two individuals ordered lettuce-wrapped burgers because of gluten intolerance allergies. The server read back the entire order correctly. As the server began to deliver the food, she recognized that she failed to get the burgers made without buns. We accepted the food and removed the bread. All meals were tasty and plentiful. My wife asked one of the servers for a refill on the water, but was never refilled. My wife later asked our primary server for a refill on her water, and the server took the glass but never retruned with it. We finally asked another individual who identified them self as one of the managers, and he quickly brought a full glass of water. We understand it was early in the evening, and attention my have been towards the upcoming excitement of Halloween night on a Saturday night, but there were some service questions I would have loved to ask the management team (like where were the trays).", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-11-04T10:06:31-0500", "location_id": "4766002", "id": "324475881", "user": {"username": "bimmerdude", "user_location": {"name": "Los Alamitos, California", "id": "32651"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Good atmosphere, mediocre food, good service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32253-d4766002-r311321686-m11068-Saddle_Ranch_Chop_House-Costa_Mesa_California.html#review311321686", "text": "My ladyfriend and I were looking for dinner the night before flying home.
