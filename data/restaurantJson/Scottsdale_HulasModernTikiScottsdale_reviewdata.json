The best and freshest tasting seafood, perfectly prepared were trapped between the 2 wonderful halves of a freshly baked large roll.  Also ordered a side of french fries, crispy on the outside, and tender inside.  Cooked the way they should be cooked or should I say fried. We had an epicurean and delightful moment orally shredding these tasty morsels.  Service was spot on despite the energy consumed by moving many mini boulders :).
