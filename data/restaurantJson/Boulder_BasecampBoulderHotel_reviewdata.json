I was notified in advance by my colleague who chose this hotel that this would not be 'fancy' or have a ton of amenities, which was totally fine by me. The rooms were really cute (loved the whole campsite/camping vibe) and clean. There are different sized rooms and the one downside about the standard room I had, was that the bathroom was tiny. Not the end of the world, but I could see how this could be challenging for more than one person. The bed was really comfy and the AC was cold. Free wi-fi was nice.\n\nI liked that they have a little cafe and breakfast bar if you need to grab & go. They also have free hot tea, coffee, water, oatmeal. granola, and cookies by the check-in area that's available round the clock. The fitness room is quite small, though they do have a Peloton bike which I thought was pretty cool. Didn't have time to check out pool. \n\nOverall, had a pleasant stay and would recommend it for folks who can embrace the laid back vibe and don't need lots of bells and whistles.

Between the limited number of downtown hotels and the high rates charged at most of them, I ended up at Basecamp Boulder. I thought it was worth taking a chance based on the recent remodel and fun things like a climbing wall, and I was mostly right.\n\nPros:\n- The location is pretty good. We wanted to be able to walk downtown, and it was an easy walk. The walk isn't particularly beautiful, since you spend the first few blocks walking through an area with lots of student apartments, but that was not a major problem for us.\n- The climbing wall was fun (although the room got quite warm). If you are traveling with kids you know that there will sometimes be some time to kill, and whenever we returned to the hotel the kids were thrilled to have a little time to climb around on the wall. That was much better than being stuck in our room and a nice change of pace.\n- There is (at least) one very friendly staff member. We didn't find all of the staff to be friendly and attentive, but there was one man (I wish I had gotten his name) who was around the grounds quite often and always offered to help us. This was especially useful because the hotel keeps their bouldering pads locked in a closet and he was always around to get them out for us when the kids wanted to climb the wall.\n\nCons:\n- The desk staff seemed aloof at best. Maybe they were just trying to convey a laid back vibe but it almost felt like they would ignore you.\n- The \"kitchenette\" that was listed on the web site consisted of a cooler and a coffee maker. No fridge, no microwave. I wasn't expecting much, but I think that saying the room has a kitchenette was a pretty big overstatement.\n\nIf I was returning to Boulder I would consider staying here again, but it didn't feel like a tremendous value. I would probably have this hotel on my list of places to consider, but would take a close look to see if there are better options available.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-07T09:03:36-0400", "location_id": "85030", "id": "415771612", "user": {"username": "Chris K", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Would not go back", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33324-d85030-r415513726-m11068-Basecamp_Boulder_Hotel-Boulder_Colorado.html#review415513726", "text": "I booked what I thought was a Quality Inn at this location.

Upon opening the door to the room, the carpet was noticeably dirty.  The overall decorations were pleasant; the bathroom was very small.  I started a complaint with Quality Inn Customer Care, who informed me the complaint could not actually be placed until I checked out of the hotel.  This was not possible, as I had pre-paid a four night's stay.  Upon checking out, I spoke with the floor manager about the condition of the room, in particular the carpet.  He said he would check it out and look at my bill to see if an adjustment could be made.  To make a long story short, when I called Customer Care again and they called the manager, he denied there was a problem with the carpet and refused to make any adjustments.  Quality Inn Customer Care also would do nothing for me except add some points to my account so I could have one free night's stay at any one of a number of their hotels.  I will not be staying at a Quality Inn or any of their affiliates again.  On the up side, Boulder was a great place to visit; lots of great shops and wonderful restaurants.

If you leave the smaller cooler open filled with ice inside of the yeti cooler, your stuff will stay dry and cold within the bigger yeti cooler***\n\nLocation: \n\nThe hotel is walking distance (less than 1.5 miles for us) in multiple directions to shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. Pearl Mall is 1.2 or so miles away, which has brew pubs, shops, and recreational dispensaries if you partake. The city itself boasts beautiful views of the Rockies, so walking is fantastic. There is also a bike checkout down the street, so there's that too. \n\nWe really enjoyed our stay and would absolutely stay here again. \n\nHighly Recommend!!!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-31T12:30:23-0400", "location_id": "85030", "id": "399686614", "user": {"username": "Julia L", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Good location", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33324-d85030-r398841627-m11068-Basecamp_Boulder_Hotel-Boulder_Colorado.html#review398841627", "text": "I don't often write negative reviews but I felt it necessary for this property.

Stuff I didn't get- the hotel was recently remodeled in a outdoor trendy motif but it looked like some of the remodeling was done by a weekend DIY guy who thought they knew what they were doing. Example the shower door enclosure can only be opened on one side, (where the toilet is located), so you have to climb over the toilet to get into the shower.

Also, the staff upon check in and check out were full of tips and super nice.

We stayed one night, looked at several room options, and then left for a place with space, light and mountain views.
