We've been in the area since Tuesday, so we've had burger and chicken, salad, but no fish.  Reading the reviews made us hungry for fish and we wanted to stay close to our motel as we are up early in the morning for final walk thru and settlement.  The restaurant is small, clean, and has three full walls of windows so there are only a few decorations.  We both had fish. My husband had the All-You-Can-Eat fish fry, but could eat only one serving- 4 long pieces, fries, and slaw. Wait, I ate his slaw.  He left one little piece of fish that was the end and was just a tad thinner than the rest of the fish.  He enjoyed his meal, although he said, it wasn't as good as a restaurant at the Delaware beach where we also have a home.  I had the same fish (pollock), but only one piece with four coconut shrimp.  I also enjoyed the fish and I liked the shrimp, but another restaurant (that Australian place) has coconut shrimp and dip that I like better.  I also had a cup of the New England Clam chowder.  The soup was good, thick, but not enough clams in my serving.  We also had a basket of hush puppies.  They were good, just a faint touch of onion, but I do like the sweet ones better.    I was not disappointed in the fries, super hot-fresh out of the fryer, not too thin, not to thick and if they were seasoned it was just a touch which was fine for me.  However, my husband  wanted some Old Bay Seasoning for his fries and fish, we'll bring some next time. No desert this time...no room.\nThe server was friendly and attentive.  She checked with us a couple of times to see if my husband wanted more fish and if all was okay. She kept our drinks filled and gave me one for the road.  There wasn't any line, but people kept coming in so it started to fill up quickly.  We will visit again.  \nService was very good and food was served hot, was good, and reasonably priced.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-15T17:39:00-0400", "location_id": "2645495", "id": "418994609", "user": {"username": "Rosem01", "user_location": {"name": "Elkton, Maryland", "id": "41129"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Delicious shrimp!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34488-d2645495-r417693765-m11068-Shark_s_Fish_House-North_Port_Florida.html#review417693765", "text": "Really love the food here.
