With its unique English pub atmosphere, awesome blends of music, spacious bar area, cozy dark-wood booth spaces and incredible menu selections, it's a gem in town.  If you stop in, know that the booths are reserved for food, so if you're just having drinks, snag a place at the long bar with comfy stools and easy views of the TVs (not to mention friendly bartenders!).  Typically this isn't a 'fast' place, but a place to unwind, slow down and enjoy your food and drinks, maybe even a game of Checkers or Trivia before dinner arrives with the games stored on shelves above the booths.  They make a great Brandy Old-Fashioned Sweet, and for dinner - their burgers are fantastic -- try the N.W.A. or the Breakfast Burger.  For out of this world mac-and-cheese, you can't go wrong with their's -- it's got four different types of cheese, is heavy, intense and delightful - and you'll probably be taking some home with you.  This isn't a standard bar, and that's why I love it.  Trivia Night on Thursdays gets very loud and crowded with limited seating/standing room, so try a different night if you're going for a more quiet dinner / social drinks.

We enjoyed our visit very much. Toad Hall is suggestive of an old English pub, with lots of dark wood and tankards hanging over the bar, so in regard to atmosphere it deserves a big thumbs up. What really stood out, however, was the food. I ordered the \"Firehouse Meatloaf\" because it sounded so tasty, and it was. It came with  sweet/tangy barbecue glaze that complemented the meat perfectly, which was not dry (a common problem with meatloaf) or so moist that it was a mushy mess. For sides I had brown sugar carrots and mashed potatoes. I'm not big on cooked carrots, but these were delicious, with just enough brown sugar to bring out their natural sweetness. What I dislike about cooked carrots is that they're tricky where their consistency is concerned; too often they're either so hard that they fight back or a wet mess, but these were cooked quite well. The mashed potatoes were creamy. My husband's biscuit-topped pot pie could have used a bit more seasoning, but he added pepper and was pleased with his meal.
