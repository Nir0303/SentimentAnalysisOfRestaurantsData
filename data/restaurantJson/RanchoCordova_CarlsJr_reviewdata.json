I live literally 3 minutes away and I won't go back due to multiple incidents.   First time they were using product that did't appear to be standard CJ product (sauces in solo cups and cod fish patty looked odd).  Then another time this girl just totall ignored me at the front counter, so long that I finally walked out.  I wasn't even rude to her or anything, but she looked at me then continued to mess with signs and napkins and ignore me.  Then one holiday they were VERY busy so I forgave them for giving me burnt jalepeno poppers.  But this last time was the final straw.  It was 11:00 at night, I was the ONLY person in the drive-thru and the walk-in was closed.  Yet they managed to give me poppers that were dried up and VERY chewy.  It was as if they were a mistake that had sat there a while, and they threw them back in the fryer when I ordered them.  How can you with good conscience give that to a customer?   There is something wrong with management at this location.  Given my experiences, I would be curious to see how clean and sanitary their kitchen and refrigeration area is.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-04T07:20:46-0400", "location_id": "4939569", "id": "361491011", "user": {"username": "valerie m", "user_location": {"name": "Rancho Cordova, California", "id": "32939"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Good burgers & fries at a very reasonable price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32939-d4939569-r323465797-m11068-Carl_s_Jr-Rancho_Cordova_California.html#review323465797", "text": "Love their bacon western cheeseburger, crisp cut fries and salads,  Quick service, and very reasonably prices", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-10-31T11:36:50-0400", "location_id": "4939569", "id": "323465797", "user": {"username": "Claudia A", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Friendly!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32939-d4939569-r249907705-m11068-Carl_s_Jr-Rancho_Cordova_California.html#review249907705", "text": "People were kind, food was good (and we had a great coupon!), and they have SWEET POTATO FRIES!
