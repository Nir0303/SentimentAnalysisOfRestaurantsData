The menu is extensive but we have only ordered pizza, ribs or wings.  The ribs are of the St. Louis variety and are usually saucy and tender.  The price for a full rack of ribs fall below dedicated barbecue restaurants as does the quality.   The rib tips are not tender and difficult to eat.  Wings are decent and the pizza is very good.  Customer service and order accuracy are very good.   Prices are right and coupons available.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-30T15:44:51-0400", "location_id": "11664615", "id": "433070822", "user": {"username": "Cleveland42", "user_location": {"name": "Ohio", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Good Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50570-d11664615-r430441067-m11068-Happy_s_Pizza-Lorain_Ohio.html#review430441067", "text": "The Pizza is OK not the best, but the fried chicken and ribs and seafood and sandwiches are very good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-21T16:20:08-0400", "location_id": "11664615", "id": "430441067", "user": {"username": "Ronho2", "user_location": {"name": "Lorain, Ohio", "id": "50570"}}}]}
