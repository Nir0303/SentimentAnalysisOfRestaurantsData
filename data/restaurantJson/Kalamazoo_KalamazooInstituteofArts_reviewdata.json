The museum is modest in size, and may not always have an exhibit that appeals to everyone, but they do a really nice job of being a place that the community can come together and share in the arts in a way that seems to be less and less appreciated in our Kardashian-filled world. The first time I went was to see the Chihuly exhibit in 2006, and it was life-altering. Such a gorgeous exhibit. The next time I went was as a student taking a weekend Platinum Printing Photography workshop over the weekend in the winter of 2016. It was like coming home to walk into the basement photo lab, smell the chemicals, and be in a room with other people who love the same things that I love, and who enjoyed seeing each other's work get printed. The instructors are a nice group of people who love making art, and love helping share their knowledge with the people who come here seeking a creative outlet to learn and hone their skills. I am currently taking a wheel pottery class, and am pleased to find that it is a little like riding a bike after 15 years out of the studio. The facilities, tools, and supplies provided to the students who attend classes are impressive and I am so glad to know that there are generous people in our community who support this facility and provide the opportunity to our community to continue participating in the arts well past our school-aged years. The classes are not intimidating, so if you are someone who loves art and wants to get started learning, no matter what age you are, or are someone who is looking to get back into the groove after some time away, sign up for a seminar or a class - you will be so happy that you did!
