We mostly go for their breakfasts and eat in. There are many loyal patrons who gather regularly for breakfast in large groups---mostly seniors, and many Veterans like myself. I have been enjoying McDonald's food since I was 13 years old in 1963. I always eat at McDonald's on vacations a few times a year. Rarely do I ever get a bad meal. This location is always clean. Parking can be bad, now that they built a new bank, and it ate up most of McDonald's parking. The handicapped access is treacherous, as cars line up for a block in the drive-up lane, and you get blocked in with no way to get out. People pretend that they don't see you, and the line never gets smaller. That is a major concern for me since I am handicapped, and on more than one occasion, I have had to turn around and go home. Again, let me clarify---this is NO fault of McDonald's. They should have never been allowed to build a new bank, tearing up valuable parking.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-15T16:28:26-0500", "location_id": "4538824", "id": "333169527", "user": {"username": "mathgenius", "user_location": {"name": "TINLEY PARK", "id": null}}}]}
