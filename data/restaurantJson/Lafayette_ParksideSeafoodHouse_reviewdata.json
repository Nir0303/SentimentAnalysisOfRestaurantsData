I have never had a bad experience here for special occasions or casual. It is small, so generally you do want reservations. Though in warmer months the outdoor seating helps capacity. I love raw oysters and you can pick your variety a la carte. Half Price Oysters (from4-6) and half price bottles of wine (all night) on Wednesdays is great for a girls' night light gathering with friends.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-10-27T03:21:04-0400", "location_id": "7133780", "id": "322293324", "user": {"username": "Susan C", "user_location": {"name": "Lafayette, Indiana", "id": "37242"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Who Knew", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37242-d7133780-r320944918-m11068-Parkside_Seafood_House-Lafayette_Indiana.html#review320944918", "text": "I had no idea this restaurant existed (it is tucked away on the residential side of a street).

He has been at Purdue for 2 1/2 years and we have always found restaurant options to be limited, so we were pleased to find this place. It is off the main drag, in a quiet neighborhood in what appears to be an old house. The interior reminded us of many seafood placed we have visited in Maine and we thought it was really cute. It is very quiet and the crowd was pretty much older people, not a college hangout. Our waitress was very attentive and prompt. The menu has several choices. We started out with the cold platter which we devoured quickly. It is very good! My husband had the lobster roll which he loved. My son and I had the scallops and I would have to say we wouldn't order them again. You get 6 fair sized scallops, but they are served in a spicy tomatilla sauce that is way, way too spicy and totally overpowers the scallops. We tried to clean the sauce off, but it was a no go. Neither one of us could finish the scallops because of how hot they are. The rice and broccoli were fine. For desert my son had the milk and cookies, which were fine and I had the cr\u00e8me brulee, which was unremarkable. Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience and we will be back in the future.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-12T07:29:41-0400", "location_id": "7133780", "id": "318021678", "user": {"username": "scarlettscar", "user_location": {"name": "Missouri", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Wanted it to be better.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37242-d7133780-r314566166-m11068-Parkside_Seafood_House-Lafayette_Indiana.html#review314566166", "text": "The service was excellent.\nThe Caesar salad was good.\nThe Key Lime pie was excellent.\nThe crab legs and shrimp were not good.\nThe lobster tail was not good at all.\nI am not sure how you can mess up shellfish.
