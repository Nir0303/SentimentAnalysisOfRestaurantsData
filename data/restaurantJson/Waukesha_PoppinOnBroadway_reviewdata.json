She creates a variety of popcorn flavors that do not disappoint! I bought the Southwestern Jalapeno Cheddar, the Cheezey Caramel, the Banana Split, and the Dill Pickle.  All were wonderful, but the Cheezey Caramel and Jalapeno Cheddar were my absolute favorites.  I even revisited the shop before I left so that I could take some popcorn home!
