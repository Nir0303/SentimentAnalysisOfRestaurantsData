The problem I have with it is that the pricing seems a little sketchy. I went for a salad and got three different prices from two different workers. No surprise the final price ended up being the higher one. Not that a buck or so is a big deal, but $8 for a small-ish salad with commercial dressing and a few chicken pieces is a bit steep.\n\nThe owner also charges extra when you use a charge card. Seems unnecessary for the amount of volume he does, and considering the prices (see comments above). I too am in a small business that takes credit cards and I do not pass that cost along to my customers.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this is very close to my office building but questionable ethics and mediocre food make me not want to return.
