Their service is predictably warm and personal, and they give an honest effort to learning each customer's name. Their coffee selection is impressive, and it's particularly attractive that you can choose your own brewing method from many. Guidance is provided as needed. They also have a small variety of waffles, scones, cookies, and sweet breads. I tried the peach thyme waffle, with honey and goat cheese. It was hearty and delicious. The atmosphere is very modern and hip (e.g. shelves made from wood planks and metal pipes), and books and board games are offered for customers to use.

In just a few short months, it has made its own unique mark on the city with nontraditional offerings, carefully-sourced ingredients, and an ability to make you feel like you're part of the family even as a first-time visitor.\n\nOne of its unique draws is the variety of methods they use for brewing, which ensures that even the die-hard black coffee drinker gets a chance to try something new. I thought I had seen every possible way of achieving a cup of coffee, but there were several methods I had never tried (let alone even heard of) that have now become staples in my own home. They also roast all their own beans, and usually offer at least 3-4 varieties to choose from for your order, or bags to bring home to grind and enjoy yourself.\n\nIf doctored-up drinks are more your thing, you'll probably find your new favorite here as well, with unique offerings like a maple cinnamon latte, honey miel latte, and a variety of great teas served both hot or iced. The baked goods are made with love and carefully considered ingredients, usually taking into account dietary needs and using organic/locally-sourced items wherever possible. All the mugs, plates, etc. are handmade by a local ceramicist who has done a fantastic job in crafting objects that are lightweight, beautiful, and perfectly fitted to the cozy atmosphere.\n\nSpeaking of atmosphere, this is an area where 20 Below absolutely shines. By your second or third visit, this will become the place \"where everybody knows your name,\" usually because they've taken the initiative and extra effort to talk to you and get to know you personally. I love bringing my work to a coffee shop, and this is the one where I consistently feel welcomed, at ease, and productive. They do everything they can to encourage this atmosphere, with a community lunch hour, bring-a-friend BOGO day, and open game nights. They also do a fantastic job of showcasing local artists, choosing a new one to feature in the shop's walls every so often, as well as hosting occasional \"meet the artist\" events.\n\nSeriously, make it a point to visit this F/M gem!
