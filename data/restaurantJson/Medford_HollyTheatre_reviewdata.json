We went on a free walking tour to view the entire theatre. Our tour guide was very informative & I was able to climb all the stairs to the top of the theatre.  They provided us with personal fans, which helped on the upper floors, which were quite warm but manageable.\nI can hardly wait until it's finished & plan to be a donor.\nJim Belushi is an active donor.\nIt will be a large enough showplace to more than double existing entertainment space in Medford & greatly contribute to the local economy.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-04T12:11:00-0400", "location_id": "10404680", "id": "379728972", "user": {"username": "joylmoran", "user_location": {"name": "Medford, Oregon", "id": "51965"}}}]}
