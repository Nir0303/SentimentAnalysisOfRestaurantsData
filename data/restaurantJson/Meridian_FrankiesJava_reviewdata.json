We loved the clean lines, cleanest of the cafe, the decorations were all fabulous. The cafe is wonderful. The freshly baked pastries and such, are to die for. i had a hard time not wanting one of each. Hubby had the \"Ego Booster\", which is a coffee drink, with wonderful coffee, and Mexican hot chocolate, and of course, fresh whip cream with chocolate dust...Outrageous. I had the Mexican quesadilla, that was filled with corn, black beans, great cheese and was served with creme fresh, piccolo de gallo, ortega chilies and sour cream..YUMMMMM Hubby had the croissant breakfast sandwich, filled to the brim with eggs, and thick bacon...All in all the food was a 11 and will come back just to try another treat.\nThe ambiance is wonderful.

Wonderful menu including lots of coffee, tea options, pastries and delicious breakfast and lunch.  You can have breakfast menu options at lunch (which are great) but there are also many great salads and sandwiches on the menu. I had a super yummy Waldorf salad with curried chicken, and my daughter had an enormous quesadilla. I also happen to be there on a Monday and they are currently running a promotion for \"Free Muffin Monday\" which you get when you order just about anything. Don't know how long it will last, but their delish lemon almond muffin became my dessert! The restaurant has lots of charm and is large and open with lots of seating in and outdoors. They are also situated right in front of a pretty play fountain. Great option when you want quick, fresh, healthy and yummy meal!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-20T19:58:39-0400", "location_id": "10462932", "id": "384470939", "user": {"username": "208sunvalleygirl", "user_location": {"name": "Sun Valley, Idaho", "id": "35614"}}}]}
