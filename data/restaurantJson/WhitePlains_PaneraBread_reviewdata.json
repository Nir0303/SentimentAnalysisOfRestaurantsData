Pretty costly but for the quality panera usually provides it is worth - especially considering they deliver when catered. My first message was never returned and knowing that these events were only coupe of weeks away I called again the second day. This time the lady that answered said she could help me with catering instead of passing along a message which is what happened first time. She was friendly , courteous but didn't seem too knowledgable. I did all the work in advance by putting together my own menu from their website catering selections. My order would have been 6/7 hundred dollars for each breakfast. That's a couple grand in total for 4 breakfast events. She said she needed to ask her catering manager questions before she could confirm my order and we agreed to speak the next day. She never did call me back and that was 7 days ago! So I called a third time and was asked to hold to talk to some one about catering. See the photo I added it plainly shows I was on hold with their number for over 5 minutes and no one came on during that time to check on my or offer to take a message. \n\nPanera - you could be in high demand in this area . Great brand and reputation but if your short staffed and / or have team members that don't really care then you better step it up.
