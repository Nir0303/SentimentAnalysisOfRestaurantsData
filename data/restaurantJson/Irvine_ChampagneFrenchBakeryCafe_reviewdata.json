We'd been wanting to try it ever since we reviewed the menu. Everything sounded great! She had the breakfast sandwich and I tried the pesto chicken and goat cheese omelet. Her sandwich looked good... lots of egg along with the herbed cream cheese and avocado, and the wheat bun looked soft and fresh. My omelet, unfortunately, was a different story. It wasn't warm, and the omelet itself didn't look freshly cooked. The chicken was tough and chewy, also just lukewarm. The best things on my plate were the country red potatoes (tender and well-seasoned) and the french baguette (crispy on the outside and tender inside). I also ordered a white chocolate mocha, but when I took my first sip I couldn't detect even a hint of sweetness. I took it back inside and explained my dilemma to the waitress and asked if they would replace it with something else, like a hot chocolate. To their credit, they took care of it, no questions asked. Since it was my roommate's birthday, we decided to splurge and we split a custard brioche. Wonderful! It was light and flaky, and not overly sweet. I'm willing to go back and try their soups and salads, but my overall impression is that their best offerings are their pastries. Everything in the case looked amazing, and considering that my baguette, my roommate's sandwich bread, and our brioche didn't disappoint, my assessment is probably spot on.
