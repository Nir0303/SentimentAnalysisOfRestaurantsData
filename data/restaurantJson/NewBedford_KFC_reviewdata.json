I've always liked KFC. Just not at this branch. Either the get the order wrong. After all it is brain surgery. Or its just two greasy and soggy to eat. The last time I got a bucket from there, not only was the meat falling off the bone, so was the skin with its soggy greasy crust. The coleslaw is still fine. I guess its hard to mess that up. I know place like this hire's a lot of high school kids. But still most of the time the manager is a little older.. If your going to be put in a management position, then manage. I always feel a little bit sick to my stomach the last few time's I've gotten take out.
