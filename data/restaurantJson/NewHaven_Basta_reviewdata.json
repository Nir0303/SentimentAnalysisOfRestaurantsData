I selected a meal that was prepared specially for me and it was amazing.  Unique for gluten free.  My wife's meal was ordered right off the menu and was just as good.  I love the small feel of this restaurant and the staff was great.  I will definitely be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-10T17:29:01-0400", "location_id": "2562594", "id": "363196643", "user": {"username": "Scott M", "user_location": {"name": "Hamden, Connecticut", "id": "33801"}}}]}
