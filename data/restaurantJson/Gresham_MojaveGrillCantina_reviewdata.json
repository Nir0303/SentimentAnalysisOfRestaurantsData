Take taqueria standard fare, then add rice and beans. That's about what you got here...  A simple taqueria type food selection in a restaurant.\n\nIt's a nice big place with a large bar area. Big TV's and the like....eh. The Coors light signs in the front window where kind of turn off. I like my Mexican Restaurants to look and feel Mexican, even if kitschy.\n\nService was adequate but rushed. Food was rushed.\n\nAppetizers were standard Mexican American restaurant fare.  The few we had were a little better than average.\n\nThe menu is SAFE..... there's nothing outside of the basic popular standards. Carne asada.. tacos, burritos, plates.  Pick you meat and they'll have it in your favorite wrapper. Al PAstor, Carnitas, Pollo, Shrimp, etc. Nothing outside this realm... To me these are very basic fare. No moles or anything that branches out. Textbook American style Mexican menu.\n\nSeafood selections had a little more variety...\n\nBasically, this menu could have been from 1985....\n\nPrices were way out of bounds... $12 for burrito. Most plates were above $12 bucks for  what you could get a better taqueria for $7.\n\nPlates arrive HOT..... Food is warm.  That says volumes! Basically, for those who don't know, that means it's not made fresh, it's reheated in a plate. \n\nHow did it all taste?  Shredded Beef had decent flavor but dry.  Tortillas looked to be pre-packaged, as did the Tortilla chips. The SINGLE salsa selection was Ok, but rather boring. Rice that appears in dishes is cooked well, but lacked any flavor definition. Refried beans tasted like Rosarita. So far, it looks like Mexican Night at the Jones house. Safeway could have catered this, so far.\n\nWe passed on the over priced seafood/shrimp dishes. $15 for Shrimp cocktail?  No ceviche.... if so, I'm sure it would have been $16 or above.  I can get good ceviche for $5 at a favorite taqueria.\n\nAl Pastor sauce/marinade was pretty good. I could taste the achiote (Annatto) but the pineapple rings from a can really brought the sense of quality down.  I understand the use of pineapple juice in the Al PAstor, but we don't really need to look at teh pineapple, this is isn't a canned ham from grandma kitchen or Betty Crocker of the 50's.\n;-)\n\nThe Chili verde was very well balanced in flavor.... Once again, SAFE and simple, but had a decent base flavor. The Pork was the prize of the night, well seasoned and cooked to a juicy tender perfection.\n\nThe word authentic really can't be used in this review... \"New Mexican American standards\" would be more appropriate.\n\nWould I go back? Sure.... if I was hungry and so happen to be in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there...", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-05T18:04:20-0500", "location_id": "6994230", "id": "353204249", "user": {"username": "Mike W", "user_location": {"name": "Portland, Oregon", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Good South of the Border Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51893-d6994230-r350866749-m11068-Mojave_Grill_Cantina-Gresham_Oregon.html#review350866749", "text": "A creative, Mexican style restaurant.

Lots of young well dressed women in lots of makeup greeted us and sat us at a table. The light on the wall was very bright, we unscrewed the bulb.  The salsa was good, the chips were cold and very average.  Our waitress took our drink order, neglecting to tell us that the \"large margarita\" was about a quart.  \nOur meal was ok, nothing spectacular, definitely gringo Mexican.  Had to ask for cilantro and lime for fajitas and the cilantro that was brought out was about a teaspoon.  \nOnce our meal was brought out, we didn't see our waitress again until our plates were removed.  We ordered a desert to go, she brought us our ticket, we left our credit card, it was run and then we waited and waited and waited. We asked about our desert 3 times and she kept saying oh, its about ready to come out. A piece of chocolate cake should not take 30 minutes to come out.  We finally got up at 25 minutes and went to the hostess desk and asked that our desert be refunded as it still had not come out.  The waitress saw us and asked about it and we said we were leaving, that waiting 30 minutes for a to go piece of cake was ridiculous.  She went back to the kitchen brought our piece of cake and then offered a $10 gift certificate.  REALLY????\nA dining experience is always about the FINISH. Don't leave guests hanging, don't have them wait to a piece of cake to go, don't have them have to ask for things.  BAD DEAL.  \nthey may look fashionable but they have not figured out how to really make the guest experience worth a second trip.  Don't be swayed by the bright orange and black outfits.  Lots of tattoos showing and makeup galore.\nWe will likely not use the \"gift certificate\"\nWe really just wanted our cake refunded. Our dinner was ok, nothing WOW or authentic.  The price was too much. the margarita was $13!!! \nNot a local type hangout.\n\nYOU HAVE TO FINISH the experience.
