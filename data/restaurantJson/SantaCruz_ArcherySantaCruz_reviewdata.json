What a great place. My wife found a Groupon for this place. I had no idea you could even do archery inside. The place was small, but it was nice. I opted to sit out, but my wife, two kids, and brother in law all took to the field. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful, and always willing to assist with tips, tricks and pointers. The session was two hours, and my kids thought the time flew by. The equipment is in really good condition. \n\nIf there was one negative, it was very hot in there, but other than that this is a great activity for the family, and with or without a Groupon it would have been awesome. \n\nThanks guys!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-11T14:44:19-0400", "location_id": "8489525", "id": "363473587", "user": {"username": "Mark D", "user_location": {"name": "Van Nuys", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Archery for the whole family", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33048-d8489525-r295144681-m11068-Archery_Santa_Cruz-Santa_Cruz_California.html#review295144681", "text": "We are always looking for something new to do with the family when we go to the Santa Cruz area and we found it at Archery Santa Cruz.  Only one of our group of 10 had archery experience.  The instruction that we received here was top notch.  They provided all equipment, instruction, and practice targets.  They were patient and made it a fun event for all of us. The owner was with us the whole two hours. We ranged in age from 23 to 61 but they said that they take in kids, too.  It was a fun family event...I may have found my retirement sport that is not golf!
