It is in the middle of an old strip mall. You enter a clean but older place and much like a grocery store it has aisles of Italian goods for sale. In the back you are greeted by a friendly staff behind a case of the most wonderful things. This is where the magic happens. It is a bakery and all though I only tried a few things I am confident that everything is of the same quality. It is a delicatessen, and if the bakery is great this is some adjective beyond great. The sandwiches are piled high with quality meat and cheese on fresh baked bread. Mmmmmm deliciousness follows like a freight train. No pretense here, no fancy sauces or choices of a salad to pump up the flavor of your sandwich. They also have cannolis, I didn't have room for one, but by the way they were flying out of there I think it's safe to assume they are great too.
