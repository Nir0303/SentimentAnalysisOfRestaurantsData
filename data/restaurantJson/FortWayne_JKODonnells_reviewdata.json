However, she didn't tell me that this new burger was $5 more expensive than the one on the menu, so I felt blindsided when the check came.  Besides that, the burger itself was gross and covered in spicy guacamole (at an Irish pub...) and the chips that came with it were burnt to a crisp.  I was surprised that whoever was working in the kitchen even put the chips on the plate.  The waitress didn't even ask for feedback about the food.  Just dropped off the check.  Rather than feeling like a valued customer, I left feeling unimpressed (and hungry).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-12T09:28:27-0400", "location_id": "783763", "id": "363670600", "user": {"username": "MmmPi", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Wayne, Indiana", "id": "37114"}}}]}
