They have an art room with all sorts of craft supplies available, an area for infants to crawl around and explore, an indoor playhouse with play food and kitchen-and an upstairs to climb up, a whole other room with story books, a puppet stage, and dress up costumes to play with. It's great because the building is located in the middle of a fenced-in park with sidewalk games, swings, slides, and other playground equipment - so rain or shine there's plenty to do. Their hours are limited because it is volunteer run, so I'd recommend checking their website for the most up-to-date opening times. They also list special programming and story times on their website. We were able to catch a special story time that had crafts and treats afterwards all included in their entrance fee of $10/family (up to 3 kids).  The price seemed reasonable since it is a non-profit and all the proceeds go towards improving the museum.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-22T16:29:03-0500", "location_id": "9601960", "id": "334514955", "user": {"username": "BekyD", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
