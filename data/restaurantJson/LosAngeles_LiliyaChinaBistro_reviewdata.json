They were both tasty and decent size portions.  My only complaint was that there were only exactly 6 shrimp in my rice.  I paid extra for shrimp so I expected a little more than that.  I plan to try a few other places in the area,  definitely a Chinese food fix if you are looking for one late. They got 4 stars from because the customer service was great.

He had gotten to know the people that worked there and he once gave them my mom's tamales (which they loved) and in return exchanged it for some of their dishes. \n\nEver since then, I got to know them a little, joked around with them and dined with them. I came to find them to be a warm people, especially during the holidays. Smiles abound all around and the diner looked clean and beautiful.\n\nbut I digress.\n\nThe food here is amazing, literally the best Asian cuisine I've ever had in LA, and I should know, I've lived in LA all my life. I've gone here and there for different Asian cuisines, but none have come close to the superb quality of service and food like Liliya China Bistro. \n\nEvery time I have business with someone, or I just want to invite a friend or friends to eat, I invite them here.\n\nThe menu is great and very wide, the service is quick and the food is beyond my understanding.\n\nOne of the things noted about this place is that it has a bar where you can watch the games as well. Plus it is right next to a club scene right next to it, where you see the wonderful people pass you by, but there are no loud noises to bother you while you dine with your friends, or perhaps a wonderful date you have for the night. ;p\n\nI love the area of this place, because after eating a lot, you can walk around the wonderfully made police station, and there's a park right across the street where people sometimes take their dogs and play with them, train them, and come together. \n\nAll in all, this place was put in a wonderful setting, the food and ambiance is warm, and it's such a strange combination of warmness and party.\n\nI highly recommend this place, for business, friends, or dates with your loved one.\n\nMaybe if you get to know them on a constant basis, you could bring tamales and tell them that its for them to enjoy. Don't do it expecting something in return, but if they know you, then maybe you'll get a treat, from this wonderful cuisine known as Liliya China Bistro.\n\nEnjoy :D", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-11-08T15:42:00-0500", "location_id": "820322", "id": "238832833", "user": {"username": "Brian V", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Hidden treasure", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d820322-r200657150-m11068-Liliya_China_Bistro-Los_Angeles_California.html#review200657150", "text": "If your in a car you could easily pass this place.
