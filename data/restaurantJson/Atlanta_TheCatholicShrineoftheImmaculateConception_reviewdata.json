In the renovation that followed a forgotten and then closed off crept was  discovered containing the remains of two priests, one being Fr. O'Reilly who is credited interceding with General Sherman as he burned much of Atlanta to save not only the Catholic Church but also several other prominent Christian churches. These remaining churches would provide sanctuary to the returning Atlantans after the Union troops moved on to Savannah, burning a 60 mile wide path to the sea.
