The ambiance, the music, the decor, the people, the food,the service, the live performances, and best of it all : Mary, the owner! No other place in the Hollywood area made us feel like family and at home  like Buleria did. It was like going to your mom's house for dinner! During our 8 days stay in Hollywood, we ate here 3 times!\nMary, the owner is an amazing person! This place has only been open for a few years and reservations are recommended during dinner time because it gets very very packed!  And there is only seating for 40 people at one time, so call and make a reservation before you go there or you will have to wait a long time to be seated!\nWhat Mary has accomplished here is amazing! Once you have entered the restaurant you feel like you are back in Spain. The decor alone is just Spanish beyond any doubt.\nThe staff is friendly and very attentive. The food is as authentic as the decor. Almost all the ingredients are imported from Spain.\nLet's talk Tapas! We tried many different tapas: garbanzos and chorizo, blood sausage, chorizo in jerez, pulpo, croquetas, jamon iberico, cheeses, etc... Tapas alone will fill you up quick! But they were all sooooooo good!\nCan we talk about Mary's amazing paellas? Yes! I tried two of them and I was in heaven!!! People...I am half Spanish and her paellas made me so happy that a tear or two were shed (or at least that's what I was told by those with me!). The first night I tried the regular seafood paella. I was not  disappointed at all. The woman knows how to make paella, No questions about it. During our last visit she made me her Paella Cantabrica (black paella). I have never seen or heard of black paella before but now it has become my favorite. If you visit Buleri and you like squid and octopus, this is the paella for you!\nLet's talk about the amazing entertainment! Two of the time we visited the restaurant was showcasing amazing performers! A small stage is set up right by the entrance and flamenco dancers and guitarists perform there on selected nights and it is just out of this world!  The atmosphere is so festive that one can just jump on one's feet and join the festive music!  \nOn our last night there, Mary shared with us as a token of friendship a very expensive and delicious Spanish Jerez (Port/Sherry). We felt honored. \nThere are not enough words to describe Mary's hospitality and warmth spirit. Her love and passion for her trade shows. Thesis by far the best place to visit while in Downtown Hollywood and we will be back soon!\nCheers, Mary! Many more years of success and happiness!\nJoe & Wayne", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-20T08:26:04-0400", "location_id": "2319361", "id": "384312624", "user": {"username": "Joseph S", "user_location": {"name": "Springdale, Arkansas", "id": "31931"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great Paella", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34296-d2319361-r381498458-m11068-Buleria_Restaurant-Hollywood_Broward_County_Florida.html#review381498458", "text": "My wife and I visited here for our last night in Hollywood, a Thursday early evening.

Prices are reasonable. The house wines are good and the Flamenco dancing is delicious (why no castanets?) I shall return soon and I apologize for having no change to tip the dancer - I shall make up for it next time. One slight drawback (I must find one.) Why the need for amplifiers in such a small restaurant? I love to hear the guitar without amplification and the crack of the Flamenco shoe certainly needs none.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-01-24T06:06:03-0500", "location_id": "2319361", "id": "342340338", "user": {"username": "Clogtowner", "user_location": {"name": "Tennessee", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Extremely slow and bad customer service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34296-d2319361-r340824482-m11068-Buleria_Restaurant-Hollywood_Broward_County_Florida.html#review340824482", "text": "My pregnant wife and I had a reservation for 8pm. We arrived at 7:58 (and very hungry). There was 1 empty table but the server (that did not catch his name, but he was short, wore glasses and bald) said that we could not take it because it was for 4 people and we were 2 and that our table was still occupied but the guests were supposed to be leaving soon, then he made us wait outside. After 13 minutes I went inside and asked him if he could at least get us water and their courtesy bread basket since my wife was very hungry. He said sure, but he never did. 10 minutes later after were were about to leave he came outside and said that the guests from our table were still there and that he was going to sit us in the same table (the 4 seater that I asked since the beginning and that has been empty all the time). We sat and ordered right away the drinks. Then 20 minutes passed by and I reminded him of the drinks and that we where waiting for him to order. He wrote our order and said that he will be with the drinks shortly. Another 20 minutes passed by and no drinks, then I see him getting drinks to another couple that arrived later than us. By that time were so upset that we stand up and I asked him if we owe him anything for the bread (the only thing he brought to the table whiting that hour) he answered no, then we left and he did not apologized and sincerely did not care. We spend 1+hour (with reservation) and we did not received anything. Then we visited the Mexican restaurant right next to it (that was full to capacity with only a 4 seater table available and 2 servers and they sat us without any issue) and within 30 minutes we ordered, ate and were ready to leave. As for us Buleria was our first and definitely last, I will not recommend to anyone.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-17T17:19:49-0500", "location_id": "2319361", "id": "340824482", "user": {"username": "RequiredLuxury", "user_location": {"name": "Hollywood, Florida", "id": "34296"}}}]}
