To be clear here: When we were seated, the menus were opened to the family style page, which explained that groups are encouraged to order off that page. When we asked about ordering individually, the waiter looked exasperated and we were essentially told that wasn't an option.\n\nWhile very tasty, the amount of food was hugely unreasonable - far more than would be appropriate for a group our size. We could have fed 20 people. This might have been considered a plus if we could have taken home leftovers, but as our group was all from out of town and staying in hotels for one night only, this was a huge waste. I would NEVER order the family style again, and if they tried to insist, I would push back HARD.  \n\nAdditionally, our server was highly inattentive... Example: After discussing beer options with the server and ordering a local beer, I had to ask three times over the span of 20 minutes where my beer was after the others at our table had already been served their drinks.  Each time the response was, \"Oh yes, I'm on my way to get it.\" If he was too busy, shame on him for not asking for more help, or at least acknowledging it.  And shame on his management for allowing it to continue.\n\nWas the food good? Yes. Was the atmosphere nice? Yes. Would I go back? Hardly -- the Denver area has many great dining choices, and once here was enough. Maybe I'll try another Maggiano's another time, but I'll never choose to return to this one if I can help it.

I was surprised when I tried to get an Open Table rezzie for 6:30 on a Saturday night and found either 5:00 or 8:00. I forgot about homecoming weekend. That said, it was our anniversary so we took the 5:00 as the other is just getting too late for us anymore. The reason I mention that it seems a little confused is partially to blame on the mix of people there. There appeared to be almost as many people in jeans and Tee-shirts/jerseys as not and I actually got some stares since I was in a sports coat.\n\nOur table was ready on time although it was a while before the waiter came by. He was good overall but it was pretty hit or miss with long gaps between visits, especially as he got busier. He explained the menu well, including the specials. Another item that prompted the confused comment is they have a group of selections on the menu that include a \"pasta gift to take home\" which I didn't think was described very well. I didn't know if we were getting a box of uncooked spaghetti or what. I guess they are competing with Olive Garden and if you choose an entree from this given category you get a second entree boxed to go. I will admit it was a great deal price wise although their portion sizes often prompt a to go box anyway..\n\nIt took a very long time to get a cocktail. They start you off with some Italian Bread with olive oil and optional balsamic  vinegar. Grind your own pepper. The Italian Salad was OK. Nothing wrong but the dressing was a little boring for me. Again, grind your own pepper. Their Lasagna is very good. The Fettuccine with Seafood was a very large portion with lot of mussels, some clams, good size shrimp, and a smattering of squid and lobster. I think I would have liked a little more flavor to the broth and maybe a hint of tomato to it but it was good. Although Carrot Cake was on the October Specials menu it would have been a $5 upcharge to go with the package deal. We ended up with a piece of Cheesecake to go. Their wine menu is good and most bottles are in the $30-$40 range. The list included a nice selection of quality cocktails. Maybe it's a case if you have to ask, you can't afford them, but I think prices could be included with the description. I never did look to see what my Rye Manhattan ran.\n\nI am glad we went early. By the time we left it was packed and there seemed to be some confusion with food coming out for other table either incorrectly or poorly timed. I will say that the high school aged patrons looked very sharp in their homecoming dresses and ties.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-09T08:29:46-0400", "location_id": "467477", "id": "426390583", "user": {"username": "RussL", "user_location": {"name": "Denver", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Delicious", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33412-d467477-r425689643-m11068-Maggiano_s_Little_Italy-Englewood_Colorado.html#review425689643", "text": "A coworker and I ate dinner at this Maggiano's and really enjoyed our meals.

They then brought it just shortly before our entrees. \n\nThe bruschetta was not as good as it usually has been but the rest of the food was great as always. The very poor and slow service made this our least enjoyable visit ever to Maggiano's. We have been to there locations in several states and several locations but have always received good service in the past. \n\nIf you visit this location I hope you get a different waiter than we did. \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-19T17:37:27-0400", "location_id": "467477", "id": "420349248", "user": {"username": "Texascowboy3600", "user_location": {"name": "Plainview, Texas", "id": "56462"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Yum!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33412-d467477-r419630817-m11068-Maggiano_s_Little_Italy-Englewood_Colorado.html#review419630817", "text": "Stopped here very late and was so hungry.
