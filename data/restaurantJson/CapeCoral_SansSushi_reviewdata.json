Good for lunch. Restaurant for dinner not well equipped and to old. I am going there every week since almost 3 years for lunch . Great outside area but owner dont care about it. Buy new tables and chairs for outside and open up the umbrellas and more people will stop by. Service is ok but not great.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-14T11:10:47-0400", "location_id": "1959541", "id": "280178967", "user": {"username": "Torsten K", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
