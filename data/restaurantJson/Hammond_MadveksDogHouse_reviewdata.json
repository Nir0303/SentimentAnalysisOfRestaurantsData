You order at the counter, have a seat in a booth or at the counter and they will bring the food to you! You can also order to go if you are in a time crunch or just want to eat elsewhere!\n\nThe service is fast so if you need to be in and out for a lunch break, it's perfect! Like I said before, it's not healthy food so you probably don't want to go everyday, but it is delicious food!! It's nothing fancy, but one of my favorite places in the area!
