Ok for those who are serving jury duty.  All visitors must go through the security points and eating here  is convenient.  Coffee is good. (and that's important if I'm waiting around)  Nice selection of pastries.  Jurors can bring food, but must put everything away (except water) when in the courtroom.  Barb's is convenient, but  I would still walk downtown for lunch when I'm on jury duty.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-07-28T16:37:59-0400", "location_id": "5572313", "id": "218101178", "user": {"username": "Lee-and-Baby", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}]}
