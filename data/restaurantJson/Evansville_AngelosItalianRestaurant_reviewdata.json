Also ordered the provalone wedges which came out as mozzarella sticks like at walmart. Everyones main course was decent but one. The seafood pasta was way over cooked, overloaded with mushroom stems, shrimp very hard and rubbery. I looked at reviews first but what I seen was not the same.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-02T14:55:57-0500", "location_id": "538856", "id": "336778726", "user": {"username": "Jared T", "user_location": {"name": "New Harmony, Indiana", "id": "37369"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Wonderful Evening!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37093-d538856-r336287785-m11068-Angelo_s_Italian_Restaurant-Evansville_Indiana.html#review336287785", "text": "Wednesday evening following a UE game at the Ford Center, my husband and I walked to Angelo's. We got to the door and the sign said the restaurant closed at 9:00 and it was now 9:15.  The owner saw us at the door and invited us in even though they were closing.  We ordered rigatoni carbonera and toasted ravioli.  No one in the restaurant seemed irritated that we were keeping them over.  The waitress was so kind and the staff went out of their way to make it very nice.  The food was wonderful and no one even tried to hurry us out the door.  Angelo's is my favorite Italian restaurant and they are very accommodating.  We enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere is great.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-31T11:55:23-0500", "location_id": "538856", "id": "336287785", "user": {"username": "Angela H", "user_location": {"name": "Newburgh, Indiana", "id": "37385"}}}]}
