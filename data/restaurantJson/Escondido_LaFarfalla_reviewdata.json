Fresh and handmade Salads, Piadina's (made with handmade bread to die for), Pizza Soup, great fresh baked cookies/lemon bars, and the BEST potato salad I've ever had. I'm not a big potato salad fan either, especially in restaurants. \nMy favorite place to go for lunch in the San Diego area. Small place with outside seating too. Kitchen is open so you can watch while they cook. \nMy favorite dishes are Original Warm Chicken Salad, \"Fig\" Warm Chicken Salad, Piadina with chicken, provolone and pesto with side potato salad. For soup I've only had the Pizza Soup and it's rich and yummy! This is one of he vey few restaurants I love to get dessert...everything is delicious.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-05T12:35:17-0400", "location_id": "4416557", "id": "232750963", "user": {"username": "4funtravers", "user_location": {"name": "san diego", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "A great treat", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32358-d4416557-r220344769-m11068-La_Farfalla-Escondido_California.html#review220344769", "text": "We driving to meet a friend in Escondido and looked for a place that had salads.
