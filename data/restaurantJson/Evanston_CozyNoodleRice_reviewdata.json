Great atmosphere.... and Fun.... I will leave it for you to find out for yourself.... I like to get seated in the second room  (not the one that you enter when you walk in the restaurant).... It is a bit less hussle bussle....\n\nFood is always top notch... fresh... tasty....  I usually order the Cashew Chicken which packs a hot hot hot punch but I love it...
