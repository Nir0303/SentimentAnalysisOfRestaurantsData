Upon arrival, this particular location does not take AMEX, and my reservation was cancelled due to not being there before 6pm.

The pincher bug that crawled across the bathroom floor as I walked in was the second. The strange flying bugs, that may have been termites, or some kind of large flying ant continued to multiply as the evening went on. The WiFi was a miserable connection. I got better seervice using my phone to provide internet. The one outlet in the bedroom was loose and you had to wiggle it just right to get your cable to stay in the wall. Finally lights out, try to sleep, and the sink and shower are dripping. Tried to turn them off further, no luck. The following morning had a freezing cold shower at 9am, and not by choice.
