I ordered General Tso's chicken and my son wanted Sesame chicken.  The online menu listed \"Crispy Chicken (Sesame Chicken)\" so that's what I ordered.  My General Tso's chicken was dry with well coated pieces of chicken but no extra sauce, it was very dry.  My son's \"Sesame\" Crispy chicken was just breaded chicken and sweet and sour sauce.  I even said I wanted the Sesame chicken or Crispy chicken, she repeated back to me the sesame chicken and we got Sweet and Sour.  Good thing my son likes S&S chicken.  Too bad he wanted something else.
