We thought we would try Tasty 8's for lunch. The outside window was fun ordering but we waited a long time for our food. I guess the server thought we were thirsting to death outside waiting so she brought out our drink. The lemonade / sweet tea was good. The food arrived and we rejoiced. We both had a hotdog with mustard, chili and slaw and my husband then asked for ketchup also. I ordered a plain weinee (no bread) for my dog. My hotdog was burned and tough but the worst part was the chili. It had beans in it and had a strange aftertaste. Also, there was no indication which hotdog had the ketchup on it so, of course, I ended up with it. I really couldn't taste the ketchup though, the burned meat and chili were quite overpowering. My husband's hotdog was also burned but he thought the chili was okay kind of. My dog loved the weiner--go figure. I could see it was burned as I fed it to her. Anyway the best part was how pricey it was!  Two hotdogs and a weiner with one small drink was $19.65.  I thought that was high but if the food had been good, I wouldn't have minded.

Wasn't impressed with the drink area or really any of the employee attention to customers. Would have told a manager about what we saw but no one seemed to be one or care. They were not that busy but need to pay attention and ask how things are going. \n\nBy the way, the tables were filthy but no one working there seemed to care. Go to Snoopy's or The Roast Grill or even Char Grill for better. \n\nTasty 8s - wake up and live up to what you could be!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-06-12T10:51:29-0400", "location_id": "7101044", "id": "279767930", "user": {"username": "jbart99", "user_location": {"name": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "id": "49463"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Should have gone to the Hot Dog Cart outside", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49463-d7101044-r279393090-m11068-Tasty_8_s-Raleigh_North_Carolina.html#review279393090", "text": "This place is the most overrated hot dog Ever.
