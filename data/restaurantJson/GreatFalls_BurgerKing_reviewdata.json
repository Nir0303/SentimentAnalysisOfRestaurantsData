A friend and I decided to have breakfast at Burger King this morning (3/18/15). I could tell something was up the way we were greeted by the front counter person. She was not happy and there was a bit of tension in the air.\nMy friend and I thought it was because of the early hour not everyone is a morning person.\nOur food took longer than normal to come up perhaps 10-15 minutes. I might add we were the only ones in the resturant at the time and no one was in the drive thru.\nFinally our order came up the front counter person was aopolgetic on the length of time it took., Still noted tension in her voice and felt it around that space.\nMy friend and I were about halfway through our breakfast enjoying nice conversation when all of a sudden the general  manager began YELLING AND BERATING an emplyee who had just reported to work.\nYou could hear this woman yelling and scraming through out the lobby area her voice was echoing off the walls. She was berating him for being late, how she had to sweep the outside of the building, how she had to do all the cooking, how she had to do everything because he was 20 minutes late.\nThis yelling and berating continued for the rest of our meal.. I left the table walked to the counter and let her know she was being rude,that  she needed to do her \"counseling\" in the back office not in the front where every one can hear her. Of course she said she was joking with the employee, I said that was not joking your tone was not jovial nor was it pleasant. I asked for the phone number to the cooperarte office she would not give it to mme. I said fine I will just call the police and let them sort it out, you were verbally attacking the employee and being disruptive to your customers, i am sure a disorderlly conduct arrest would be in order. She would not give me the number to she dialed it herself. In the mean time the employee was trying to cover for her she put him up to it thry were in the back whispering when she was dialing cooperate for me. He said it was all a joke i said no it was not she needs to learn people skills and how to handle situations like this.\nI finally was able to speak to Kim in cooperate in Billings, MT I let her know what exactly transpired and how disruptive it was to us as customers and how unprofessional it was of her to do this to anyone in public. Kim agreed with me and said she would handle it. i suggested termination on the spot.  \nBy the time we left her story had changed to how he went from being an employee to now being her boyfriend. I did not belive her nor did my friend believe her. \nI will not darken any Burger King doorway in Great Falls again...I am sure if this General manager is this way then there are other problems in other stores as well. Cooperate needs to get a handle on this before someone does call the police or it gets out of hand by someone saying the wrong thing then it just escelates out of control.\nThis was the Northwest Bypass locaton in Great Falls MT.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-03-18T13:48:00-0400", "location_id": "4957874", "id": "260415080", "user": {"username": "starsweptsky", "user_location": {"name": "Great Falls, Montana", "id": "45198"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Alwynbilly comfort food reviews", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45198-d4957874-r244995884-m11068-Burger_King-Great_Falls_Montana.html#review244995884", "text": "Burger King features a great value menu, and most places have the biggest selection of no or low calorie drinks I have seen.
