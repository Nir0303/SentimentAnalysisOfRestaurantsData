You can choose to dine inside or out - it was a hot day so we chose inside.  The AC was struggling to keep up, but it was still comfortable.  Our booth was in the bar area, which was great.  Our waitress was right on time and attentive without being a problem.  I asked her for a recommendation (something that would get me to come back) and she recommended the shrimp & chicken quesadilla.  I loved it.  They also have an extensive selection of draft beers, including many of San Diego's famous local brews in addition to Guiness and other favorites.

They have a HUGE outdoor patio with plenty of covered dining spots and so we chose a spot outside, but it felt a bit warm under the canopy. We probably should have opted to go inside, but that's neither here nor there. Our waitress was prompt and agreeable. The menu is varied and has a variety of Mexican dishes and also their \"specialty\" is an assortment of flatbread choices. I have a very sensitive palate (I'm not being uppity - I just really have a hard time with spicy food), so I have to be careful about what I order. I noticed some of their items were \"Cajun\" or \"Louisiana this or that\", so I asked if the \"crabcake salad\" was spicy. She said she didn't know, but would ask. I said if it wasn't, I would get that. My husband ordered a club sandwich, a third person ordered a burger, and a fourth ordered a flatbread with pork carnitas w/mango salsa. These dishes were in the $12-$14 range except for the burger which was around $9. When the food came, my \"salad\" consisted of greens, several slices of avocado, a sliced tomato and 2 small crab cakes. The crab cakes were very spicy (IMO). The waitress did not come back to ask about it until AFTER everyone had eaten, but I did eat them because I wouldn't have wanted to hold things up by sending them back. I just wish the chef had said he uses a lot of paprika and black pepper in the first place. My friend with the flatbread gave me a bite of hers. That was REALLY spicy! She didn't mind. It burned my mouth. So, it all depends on what a person likes. I would have a hard time going there again because of this, but they would go there again in a heartbeat. She loved the flatbread. I thought it was kind of chewy and the pork was rubbery, but it was cold by the time I tasted it. My husband's club sandwich was okay, but then a club is boring to begin with. He didn't like the honey mustard dressing on his side salad. So, it just depends on your own individual taste, I think. Downtown El Cajon is an interesting place. We're glad we checked it out and the restaurant itself seemed very nice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-03-15T03:01:52-0400", "location_id": "875290", "id": "154621227", "user": {"username": "beachmeisters", "user_location": {"name": "Laguna Woods, CA", "id": null}}}]}
