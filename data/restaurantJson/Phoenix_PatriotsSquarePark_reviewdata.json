Patriots Sq Park, which was a real park, has been replaced by CityScape. 3 photos-if they are posted-show what it used to look like. All that is gone. It was dismantled beginning in 2009. CityScape, I believe, is 4 blocks and I only saw one in Oct 2012. There is a small park like area, with grass, a fountain and umbrellas. It's nice. There are lots of shops and restaurants there-completely different than it used to be. I'll post my most recent photos of the area under CityScape. I think it's worth seeing. Some of the questions about this location, I am unable to answer.
