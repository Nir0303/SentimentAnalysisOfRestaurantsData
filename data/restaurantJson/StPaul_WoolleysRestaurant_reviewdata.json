This place is top notch for fine dining in a unique spot. My wife and I usually go here for special occasions such as an anniversary, birthday, etc.\n\nFirst of all, the location: it feels like you are in a beautiful garden complete with waterfall. The lights are dim and you cannot tell that you are in a hotel atrium. If you are lucky to be seated in the gazebo area, even better! Very cool space.\n\nThe Food: The food is simply amazing. We have had many different entrees here but I keep coming back to their delicious pastas. The Cajun Pasta is great, but my favorite is the Black and Blue Pasta, blue cheese, seared red onions, and steak...can't beat that combo! And at the end of every meal you get house-made lemon cotton candy to cleanse your palate. Now that is awesome!\n\nThe Service: The people are super friendly and always smiling. Service is professional and prompt.\n\nThe Price: Super affordable for what you get. This place has the quality of a 5-star restaurant but won't cost you an arm and a leg. Very reasonable prices.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-12-04T05:08:26-0500", "location_id": "818903", "id": "330681815", "user": {"username": "MNMAVERIC", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "id": "43501"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Really?

My steak (Filet Mignon) ordered medium rare was truly a warm red center, but was quite tough and even difficult to chew. Another guest had the flat iron steak that was truly much tastier with a buttery texture and quite delicious. In a rare instance, I did not even finish my steak. I left unsatisfied. \n\nThe creme brulee on the other hand was awesome. I am a self proclaimed connoisseur of creme brulee since it is one of the few desserts I can eat. The sugar was perfectly browned and thick, not just a thin layer of crispiness but a nice solid crunch. The creme was vanilla bean and not too cold or room temp but juuuuuust right!
