Three squad cars arrived at the motel late afternoon and took someone away and in the morning I was hit up for change, cigarettes, or something by a couple I found out was staying at the motel. Went for a drive and got back about 9:30 and had to  bully my way past a big black truck parked squarely in the center of the driveway, edge around it after it backed up in order for me to park my car, and then do a stare down with a kid going into the pool area.\nFrom what I can see, the gates giving access to the room areas were not locked at night though they have card access slots so anybody can walk into what is suppose to be a secure gated area. It is not a slum area, but is on the border.\nThe ac blew cold, but also blew all its air right on my head no matter where I slept in the king bed.\nThe rooms were nice, I checked in early, and the furnishings were not all burned in places. Pillow top mattress and very nice pool area.\n\nA plus, is that this motel is located a few blocks from the Glendale historic downtown and antique area, but I would not advise single females to just wander that spot at night. If you do go, head for the Murphy Haus for German beer and cheap to expensive eats with great staff members.\n\nNice park for dog walking one to two blocks into the downtown.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-09-25T11:52:05-0400", "location_id": "73423", "id": "178609009", "user": {"username": "TravelerWithDog", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Havasu City, Arizona", "id": "31262"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2013-08", "title": "Lacking in the Fundamentals", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31231-d73423-r175994783-m11068-Motel_6_Glendale-Glendale_Arizona.html#review175994783", "text": "Oh Baby!
