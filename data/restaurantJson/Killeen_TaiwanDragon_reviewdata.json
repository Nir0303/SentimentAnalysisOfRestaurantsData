Unfortunately, the crispy duck was less than crispy, although the duck was tasty. The fried rice was good but not remarkable. What we really enjoyed was the host, Mr. Jackson, who provided us with a one man tour of his incredible photo collection on the walls of the restaurant. Service was good. What we enjoyed most was the opportunity to be together in a very friendly and welcoming place with good food overall.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-14T04:54:02-0400", "location_id": "513401", "id": "372799231", "user": {"username": "PhillyBoy21", "user_location": {"name": "Naples, Florida", "id": "34467"}}}]}
