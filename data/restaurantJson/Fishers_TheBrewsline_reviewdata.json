Each booking was cancelled only 2 days prior the the scheduled event because they didn't have enough seats on the bus purchased.  Once  I can forgive, but  twice is just unprofessional.\n\nWhen I emailed the owner to point it out there was no apology or attempt to remedy, only the following:\n\n\"Groupon will process your refund. We will refund your service fee as well. If you have any issues processing through groupon let us know.\n\nThanks \n\nKevin\"", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-19T13:53:55-0400", "location_id": "8283581", "id": "374651919", "user": {"username": "Christine C", "user_location": {"name": "Indianapolis, Indiana, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Great way to tour local breweries!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37104-d8283581-r284427035-m11068-The_Brewsline-Fishers_Hamilton_County_Indiana.html#review284427035", "text": "Bus and driver were great!
