We chose this particular establishment because it was listed in the magazine \"Directory of Iowa's Best Ma & Pa Restaurants\" that I gave my husband for his recent birthday.  Upon entering the restaurant, one is instantly taken back to a simpler time with all of the antiques and collectibles that line the walls and available countertops!  After being given directions on how to proceed, we picked our table in the rear of the building, where again, antiques adorn the bookcase wall units and clutter the walls!  The menu is very simplistic, with the daily specials written on the chalkboard behind the meat case.  All 3 of us chose the soup special, which consists of a half sandwich, a cup of soup, a bag of chips, a pickle spear and drink of your choice.  We were NOT disappointed by our selections - the cheeseburger chowder was fabulous and my daughter loved the chili - the ham and provolone sandwich won my daughter over (she likes her American cheese, so was hesitant to try something new) while my husband truly enjoyed his roast beef and turkey on rye and as for me...well...the pastrami and Swiss was beyond excellent.  Our sodas tasted like the originals from the 60's/70's, which was a rare treat!  The only negative, if I had to find one, was that they don't accept debit/credit cards - but they do accept checks!  Other than that, if one wants to take a stroll down memory lane, with a relaxing lunch, this is the place to go while in historic Valley Junction shopping!!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-22T19:13:35-0400", "location_id": "415344", "id": "235809197", "user": {"username": "TLaehn2011", "user_location": {"name": "Newton, Iowa", "id": "38228"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "fun setting for lunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38519-d415344-r176120122-m11068-General_Store_Eatery-West_Des_Moines_Iowa.html#review176120122", "text": "Fresh soups and sandwiches in what looks like a 1940's or '50's mom and pop grocery.
