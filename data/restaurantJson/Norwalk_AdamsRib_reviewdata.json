But rest assured, you will be delighted that you were one of the first to rediscover this lovely spot nestled in The Norwalk Inn & Conference Center.  The hotel was buzzing on the night we went, with private parties in the ballrooms and a reception in the glass-enclosed patio. The lobby was awash in warm wood tones, and the dining room was beautifully decorated and though quiet busy, wonderfully quiet.  The best was yet to come -- the food. Our waiter, Brian, made sure our drinks came quickly as we poured over the menu which, uncharacteristic to newer, trendy spots, had a perfect selection of steaks, seafood, chicken and pastas. It was hard to decide, but everyone in our party managed to find exactly what they wanted - and everyone had something different.  We all started with a salad: the caesar was one of the best we've had, and a signature salad with walnuts, gorgonzola, red onion, carrots and fresh greens was quickly gone from the plate.  Our entrees were superb: the perfect cut of prime rib, a generous expertly cooked rib eye and NY Strip, Scallops over risotto, and homemade ravioli - an ample portion not found in \"shee-shee\" Italian joints. The entrees came with a full complement of roasted potatoes, carrots, and best of all, the rib-eye was topped with onion rings -- although the person who got them refused to share.  Service was amazing: unobtrusive and efficient.  Although everyone left not a bite on their plates; we opted to split a few chocolate cakes for dessert.  Now, THIS was a serious slab of sweet - a combo of milk and dark chocolate cake, frosting, all atop a cookie crunch.  Not a morsel remained.  It's not often that a restaurant in a hotel, especially a small hometown Inn, can deliver on a five star meal. And all for less than $30/head. Adam's Rib is just that place.  But don't tell too many people; this is a secret treasure to keep to yourself.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-10-16T16:51:52-0400", "location_id": "3610548", "id": "181317233", "user": {"username": "Imtraveling4u", "user_location": {"name": "Westport, Connecticut", "id": "33979"}}}]}
