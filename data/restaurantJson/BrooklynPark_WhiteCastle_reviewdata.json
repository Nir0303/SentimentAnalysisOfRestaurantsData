I have been eating White Castle sliders for about 60 years. That's right.... We used to go (on Sundays) to the original Minneapolis store on University as a family outing. The burgers are still the same... wonderful. In my case, guaranteed indigestion, non stop burping and probably a trip to the bathroom at some point. It's a beautiful thing! The fries and onion rings are a 10, and their Cokes are the sweetest you can buy. The Brooklyn Park location has been in this neighborhood for years and it's still there serving sliders. If you have never tried their burgers, go get the #1 combo which includes four sliders, fries and a Coke. Steamed 100% all beef, steamed bun and onions. The only way to improve this burger is to maybe add a little ketchup. Generally the staff is way friendly and helpful. You have to experience this on your own!
