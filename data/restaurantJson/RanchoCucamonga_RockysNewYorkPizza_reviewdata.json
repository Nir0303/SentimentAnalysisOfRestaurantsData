My husband and I ordered small calzones, which were actually pretty substantial.  He had the meatball and really liked it.  I had a pepperoni calzone and it was also very good.  They served the calzones with a side of tomato sauce and a side of ranch. You place your order at a window, they give you a number and deliver the food to your table.  Seating is available at mostly long tables with chairs. You are allowed one drink refill per person, which you obtain at the order counter. My only complaint was that they seemed to have ceiling fans rather than air conditioning and the place got quite hot on a humid, sultry 95 degree plus evening.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-08-03T13:05:22-0400", "location_id": "4661126", "id": "219316040", "user": {"username": "CacheOn", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}]}
