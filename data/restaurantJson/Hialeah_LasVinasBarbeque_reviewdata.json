The place had been recommended from a local person. Did not like that the chicken was really dark in the yellow rice. Maybe it was good. But just by the looks my mom and I did not eat it and neither did my husband. I made the mistake of not asking if they used white meat. I'm so use to it. Automatically it's always done with whit meat. On the bright side. The sweet plantains were super sweet just a bit greasy but very good. It's a good place to go eat there.
