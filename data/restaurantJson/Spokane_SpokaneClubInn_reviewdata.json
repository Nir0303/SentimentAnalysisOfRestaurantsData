Room service breakfast is reasonably priced and very tasty.  The only downside is that our room (#319), while clean, is very dated.  The furniture and the little bathroom looked like they had not been changed in thirty years!  This did not bother us as we only care about cleanliness, but if you expect a spiffy updated look, be sure to ask if there is a more recently renovated room.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-22T14:40:18-0400", "location_id": "2519675", "id": "291570524", "user": {"username": "SCL60", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Oswego, Oregon", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Can't go wrong!

Our first nights stay was in Spokane. Oh my, so many places to choose from. Somehow the Spokane Club caught my fancy. When I consulted with a friend who lives in Spokane, she told me, that she had heard only good things about it, but was afraid, that it would be very expensive. So I called, and was pleasantly surprised to find out, that the rates were better than most other hotels in Spokane. On top of it, the restaurant was rated first class, and open to members and guests only. The room was small, but clean and very nice, it reminded me of a European hotel. A very large closet with terry cloth robes, a nice bar with a modern coffee maker, and even bottled water in the refrigerator. The bathroom was a bit dated, but clean and roomy, plus it held a good size locking closet to store valuables.\nThe staff was very efficient, from Ryan, Derek and everyone else. And best of all, the valet parking was only $14.00, compared to $50.00 most of the other places demanded. We liked it so much, that we booked a room for our return trip. I certainly will recommend this place to all my friends.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-06-29T19:38:07-0400", "location_id": "2519675", "id": "284049970", "user": {"username": "Marigupen", "user_location": {"name": "Westport, Washington", "id": "58823"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Value and charm", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58759-d2519675-r279744305-m11068-Spokane_Club_Inn-Spokane_Washington.html#review279744305", "text": "This hotel is on the national historical landmark registry and is charming place that is a great vale.
