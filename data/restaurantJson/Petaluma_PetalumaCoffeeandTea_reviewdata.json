We thought the barista made a fine coffee drink.  The feel of this location was relaxed and not hurried nor did the staff seem overwhelmed during a 5 minute rush when suddenly the line went out the door.  \n   My only small negative comment was about the sample coffee they had sitting out to try.  It was an estate grown coffee, dark roasted and with a really complex flavor that I loved.  The sample was sitting in the original French press it was made in.  Thus the sample I drank was cold, which changes the coffee flavor.  They were too busy while we were there to ask them to make a hot sample.\n   This Peet's like the one on 4th ave. in downtown Santa Rosa had some street people sitting inside (rather than outside like at 4th Ave.) whose clothing wafted an odor that caused us to move across the room to another seat.  The people were nice enough unlike those outside the Santa Rosa store.  I had a conversation with them about the coffee.  But this is the second Peet's now I tried in this area where street people make the place not so comfortable to just sit around and relax in for 15 or 20 minutes.  I feel bad writing this, like I'm heartless.
