This was recommended by friends and we were pleasantly surprised because the outside does not look like a great place to eat. But once inside and you smell the delicious aromas greeting your senses you'll think so too. Delicious coffee. Unusual menu items that delight your palate.

Menu is tapas style with small plates, medium plates and large entree plates. Nice wine list.\n\nEach of the several small plates we tried was excellent. \n\nMy husband had the striped bass special and it was so perfectly done. I had the roasted zucchini on naan entree, very tasty!\n\nDesserts also super. Mine featured small batch coffee ice cream, the best I've had.\n\nLilac will be one of our favorite Billings restaurants!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-06T07:11:43-0500", "location_id": "3332144", "id": "353329251", "user": {"username": "GulchFamily", "user_location": {"name": "Montana, USA", "id": null}}}]}
