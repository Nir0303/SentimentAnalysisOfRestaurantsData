It's not fancy or spiffy but what it lacks in fluff it makes up for in flavor.  Located in the heart of downtown mission it's an easy drive from anywhere in the vacitity. The menu offers all the traditional plates such as fajitas and enchiladas but you can also experience delicacies like chilaquiles for breakfast or clabaza con Pollo for lunch or dinner. I highly recommend you try and order of re-fried beans as they are hands down spectacular! I promise you will not be dissapointment with the food here which I am sure you will tell all your friends about.
