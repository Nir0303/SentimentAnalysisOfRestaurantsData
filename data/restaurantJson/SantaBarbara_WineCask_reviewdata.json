We were not disappointed. We had the wild mushroom soup to start then wild mushroom risotto to go with the Rib Eye which was one of the best I have ever had, my wife agreed and she is not a real carnivore.

If you're doing a biz lunch with limited time, go elsewhere, but if you're doing a leisurely lunch and particularly a supper, this place has FABULOUS food.  It reminds me a little of fine dining in Italy, where you'd better not be in a rush.  I had scallops and Kat a perfectly cooked chicken and a wonderful salad.
