Let me start by saying that the food was really good. With that being said, let me get to the size of the items. First, the garlic knots were excellent, but I only got 6 that were smaller than doughnut holes. $5 was way too much for what I got compared to other pizza places where it would be less money and bigger knots. Secondly, was the side  chicken caesar salad. The caesar salad itself was good but real small like a mcdonald side salad for a dollar. Now the grilled chicken on it was lacking flavor and bland! The salad with chicken was $8! Again, way too much for what you get. Now here is the really bad part. I ordered the bbq chicken pizza which had as much topping on the whole pizza as what you would go other pizza places and have on one slice. The pizza was $12(see picture below). This is what I was mostly disappointed at. Also they were out of 3 of the happy hour beers. Other than that, service was great, and atmosphere was nice.
