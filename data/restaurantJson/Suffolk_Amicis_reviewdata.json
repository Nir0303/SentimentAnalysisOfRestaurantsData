We have been eating here since it opened.  Over the years, they have had a few bumps in the road, such as when the cook quit and when they changed food suppliers for some of the ingredients.

The pizzas are fam favs, the New Yawka, BBQ chicken, BBQ shrimp, and the list goes on and on.  I have never been disappointed, from the lasagna to the Penna Ala Vodka, Baked Ziti, to the steaks.  The fresh baked bread and butter is a nice touch to the meal.  They have a full wine list and very large beer list.  The salads and the appetizers are very good.  They usually offer a Valentine's Day special, which includes a bottle of wine and they offer specials during restaurant week.  Our most recent visit was on Father's Day and the entire family enjoyed our casual lunch.  I will say the servers have been excellent and a few have needed more training, but overall service has been good for us.  If you are a local, you can almost be assured to run into family or friends while visiting.  The AC is sometimes very cold, so I would suggest a wrap, perhaps.  The place can get noisy with the very high ceilings.  There is an outdoor patio that has very nice seating during warmer weather, and they also have patio heaters during the winter months, if that appeals to you.
