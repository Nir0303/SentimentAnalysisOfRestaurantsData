What we go had no meat of any kind and no sour cream.\n\nAfter we informed the waitress, she took our plate away and returned maybe 5 minutes later.  The replacement was made properly but it was terribly skimpy on everything but chips.  Most chips had just a light smattering of beans on one corner\u2014seriously, just one corner\u2014a fairly reasonable amount of cheese, and a couple very small cubes of chicken.\n\nOur waitress was a bit stressed, but there was a lot of foot traffic, so I can't fault her there.
