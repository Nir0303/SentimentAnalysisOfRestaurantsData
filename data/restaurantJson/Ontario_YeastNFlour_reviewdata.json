HOORAY!  We have very few places to eat that are close enough to walk to, so very excited for something new!  As soon as I saw it on Yelp, we ran down for lunch.  Yeah, it was 12:30 so everyone else did, too.  We had a bit of a wait.  it's the same system as at a Chipotle or Subway, where you wait in line, then order and they make it as you walk by the ingredients.  Then you pay and wait for the cooking part.\n\nI had the pizza and my friend had the meatball sub.  I had a garden salad and she had a Caesar salad.  I liked that they pretty much made my salad by saying, what do you want in it and I could pick.  I like that.  Also, I thought the pizza was personal sized, but truly two people can easily eat one pizza... I could not finish mine, although I did start with salad.\n\nIts affordable unless you buy two things like we did!  For my pizza a garden salad (good sized!) and a fountain drink it was about $15.\n\nStaff is friendly, but still new, so they will probably get quicker at swirling the sauce on as they get more practice.  Only thing I wasn't happy with was someone was walking around with a tray of food and I thought it may be ours and I tried to wave at him, but he turned around and then he was working behind the counter, so I thought it must not have been ours, only to find out a few minutes later, he just sort of dumped it there and no one let us know our food was ready.  Kind of weird.\n\nLots of seating, it's a good sized place and they have televisions.  They also have bottles of beer for $2.99.  WHAT?  Pretty cheap for a beer... love that, although obviously not at lunch!\n\nOverall, really happy to have them in the neighborhood.  I will probably try to NOT go between 12-12:45 next time, though, but I will be back and I've already been spreading the word at work!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-21T08:55:30-0400", "location_id": "8775783", "id": "366097930", "user": {"username": "ladyjadegd", "user_location": {"name": "Escondido, California", "id": "32358"}}}]}
