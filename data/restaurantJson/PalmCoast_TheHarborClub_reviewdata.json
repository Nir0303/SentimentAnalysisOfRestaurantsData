Este destino de la Florida lo disfrutamos much\u00edsimo ya que en  primer lugar el resort nos resulto amplio y muy c\u00f3modo, mis hijos  realmente estuvieron encantados con la playa y la alberca. Nos agrado mucho que las habitaciones fueran tan amplias y con todos los servicios ya que as\u00ed  no nos preocupamos de salir tanto del desarrollo o llevar tanta ropa ya que contaba con una excelente lavadora y secadora. El destino resulto tambi\u00e9n muy tranquilo, por lo que viajar con ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os aqu\u00ed es realmente recomendable porque nos sentimos seguros y  lo disfrutamos much\u00edsimo.\nEn nuestras salidas aprovechamos a realizar compras y tambi\u00e9n al  rentar un auto, pudimos conocer los sitios atractivos de los alrededores, nos la pasamos de maravilla. No es un hotel cinco estrellas pero cuenta con instalaciones, restaurante y un ambiente agradable para disfrutar de las vacaciones.\nTambi\u00e9n  mi esposo  y yo disfrutamos del buen ambiente que hay en el sitio en las noches hay restaurante y bares muy agradables por la zona, nos toco un clima muy agradable. Para nosotros como familia nos interesa mucho que las vacaciones de nuestros hijos  sean lo m\u00e1s felices para todos.\nEn cuanto a la comida disfrutamos de los platillos de restaurante, nos gusto que tambi\u00e9n el personal siempre estuviera muy al pendiente de todo lo que necesit\u00e1bamos. Este viaje tambi\u00e9n lo pudimos combinar con los parques tem\u00e1ticos en Orlando, por lo que tuvimos unas maravillosas y largas vacaciones en la Florida teniendo diversi\u00f3n para chicos y grandes!! \nEn verdad lo recomendamos ampliamente", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2011-07-05T14:02:41-0400", "location_id": "275385", "id": "115063089", "user": {"username": "juanmau45", "user_location": {"name": "Puebla, Mexico", "id": "152773"}}}]}
