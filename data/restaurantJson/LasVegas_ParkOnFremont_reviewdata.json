The atmosphere is priceless and our service was second to none. The menu is limited bar food but tasty. Our table tried a few things. Chicken finger bites are huge and delicious. Sweet potato tots are great as well. I ordered the chicken and waffles, they were average. The highlight was the cookie skillet. Best I've ever had!  Can't wait to try a burger next year!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-10T05:30:02-0400", "location_id": "4191762", "id": "390984503", "user": {"username": "368KeriA", "user_location": {"name": "Concord, North Carolina", "id": "49049"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Feels like a Wes Anderson movie", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d4191762-r389384801-m11068-Park_On_Fremont-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#review389384801", "text": "The decorations are fun and quirky.
