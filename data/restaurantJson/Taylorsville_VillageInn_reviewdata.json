The Hostess asked us if we would like anything to drink and told us our waitresses name and then came back quickly.  Our Waitress came pretty quickly after that and asked us if we were ready to order, which we weren't but I had to tell her that the hostess already took our drink order.  The waitress returned a few minutes later and took our order; Instead of my soup coming before my meal arrived everything came all at once, the waitress indicated to me that the meal was ready before she had time to make the soup (funny; like she is actually back there making my soup).  \nThe food was hot and delicious and we sure received a lot of food for the money.\nOur waitress come-by often to ask how our meal was going and of course we said \"Great\".\nBy the way I ordered their Chicken Fried Steak and it comes with your choice of sides and soup or salad.

The timing was perfect, we were in between crowds and no little kids around us.  It gets better.\nOur server was a charming young lady who actually thought that the customers were to be treated like she would want to be and she excelled at it.  Her name is Gabby.\nI had my standard, Ultimate breakfast and the wife had the VIB. I told Gabby that in another of the Village stores there had been a problem getting the food to us hot and the cook acted like he was paying for the potatoes by looking at the miserly portions.  She told me that would not happen and Gabby does not lie.  It came out hot, fresh and tasty.  \nI did have to ask the manager to turn the background music into background music.  I have hearing aids and loud music really fouls it up.  He moved on it right away and got the volume just right.  \nI have to tell you this place was run right and it all started with Gabby.  The worst thing about it is it is not on my travel route so it is awkward to get to.  \nI would go there again and the only problem is that once you are on top of the mountain you have to fight to stay there.  Keep up the good work because I write my reviews as I see them.
