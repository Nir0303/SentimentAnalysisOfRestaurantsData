Once the food finally came out, everything was very average. The best thing was the garbage can nachos (the presentation was awesome).

I was there for a show, and I did like the patio had great view of the stage. I did think the pricing was high, but that was to be expected. I ordered the turkey burger, and it was good. Did I think it was worth the price no. I thought the turkey burger was good, but thought the cranberry sauce on it was overpowering. It would have been great without it. The service was good. I'm glad I tried it but it wouldn't be a go to spot.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-03T18:26:16-0400", "location_id": "10837192", "id": "424867212", "user": {"username": "razorback1430", "user_location": {"name": "Knoxville, Tennessee", "id": "55138"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Nothing special ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g39604-d10837192-r424219092-m11068-Guy_Fieri_s_Smokehouse-Louisville_Kentucky.html#review424219092", "text": "The wife and I decided to give this place a try since we've been seeing a lot about it on the local news. We went a little after 3 to beat the dinner crowd and was seated immediately. The place is decorated nicely in the server and I think's name was Scott was extremely nice. The wife ordered the smokehouse burger which came with fries and I had something like a sampler platter of barbecue pulled pork, beef brisket,   sausage, and coleslaw. I also got a side of macaroni and cheese and brussels sprouts with bacon. My wife said her burger was very good, my dinner was OK nothing special. The beef brisket was really good, the pulled pork was a little too dry, and the ribs I didn't care for because I really don't like barbecue rubbing on him I would prefer them wet. On the other hand the two sides I ordered was very good. The macaroni and cheese was almost as good as my mothers and I really like the brussels sprouts with bacon.
