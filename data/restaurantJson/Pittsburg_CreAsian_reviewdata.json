The location is great.  Downtown Pittsburg is very picturesque with palm trees and fairy lights in the trees at night. The restaurant sits on a corner with a park across the street. I love sitting outside on the patio facing the park with the water from the Delta making a great view in the distance. Although this restaurant is part of a chain, it feels like a neighborhood spot. Food is reasonably priced. I usually order #62 which is bird's nest noodles with wok-fried chicken and shrimp and vegetables.  I dream of the delicious sauce!  Cost is $9.00 for a healthy portion which can be stretched to two or three meals.  There are many items that cost even less. The cuisine is listed as authentic Vietnamese, but you can find dishes that seem more Chinese or more Thai or more Korean. There is a good variety to choose from. I have gone there for intimate meals and large group luncheons. I have eaten both outside and inside. Service has always been quick and efficient.  There are TV's scattered around the room for viewing sports, if you are so inclined.  There is also a full bar.  Take out service is available. All of my companions have been pleased with their meals.
