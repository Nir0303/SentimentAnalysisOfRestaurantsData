I once placed a large food phone order by mistake from the Morgan Hill site instead of the Sunnyvale site, some 30 miles apart.  .  \n\nThe Sunnyvale  store is located in a small strip mall hidden from one of the busiest intersections in Sunnyvale -El Camino Real and Mathilda -where two 8 lane roads meet.  Unfortunately you cannot see Ginger Cafe from the intersection, and is hard to find unless you are looking for it.  Across Mathilda is PF Changs restaurant right on the corner of the intersection, anchoring a large shopping center.  Down the street is Sunnyvale Tennis Center within 100 yards of the parking lot.   \n\nWe walked in without a reservation on a Saturday evening at 645pm. Majestic cathedral ceilings 18 feet high, with lighted decor.  Mahogony colored wooden tables, scarred through 10 years of use,  with comfortable matching colored wooden chairs with padded backs and bottoms.  Paper napkins instead of cloth napkins, and only one fork instead of two.  No cloth table cloths, but paper place settings.  Small bar with 4 chairs in front of a single TV monitor at the entrance.  About 20 tables of 4 arranged in a semi circle around an Oriental center piece.\n\nThe place is packed, and we wait 15 minutes to get seated, another 15 minutes for the order to be placed, and at least 15 minutes for the food to arrive in piecemeal, with the meat dish arriving at least 5 minutes before the rice, and then the cold appetizer plate.  The waitress dressed in all black from head to toe, a la Matrix style, is apologetic about the lengthy delay in getting our food.  This is not good, as the meat gets cold while waiting for the rice.             \n\nOur Chinese chicken salad $9 comes with salad, carrot strips for color, and heated sliced strips of chicken breast, arranged in a colorful presentation.  I would have preferred more dressing, as it is barely noticeable.  The portion is very generous and could have served 4.  We ask for and receive separate plates and forks for the salad.  \n\nThe kung pao chicken $12 comes with carrots, onions, mushrooms, celery, peanuts, chili peppers, along with hunks of chicken .  The dish is delicious, but the hunks of chicken are too large for eating without a knife, and should have been cut into smaller bite size pieces.  Again a very large serving, feeding 4.  It goes well with the family size white rice $3.50, which arrives without a top to the rice pot. .   \n\nFinally we get the garlic prawns $16 cooked with hot green jalapenos,onions and  scallions in a small pot dish.  The small bowl contains maybe a dozen prawns, and is to die for.  My late 91 year old mother loved this dish.  This dish is spicy hot, and causes my forehead to break out in a deep sweat.  I quickly drink up both mine and my wife' s glasses of water, before the waiter brings more water.  \n\nWe bring along a coupon and with our $40 purchase get a free dessert, \nfried bananas coconut ice cream $7.  This consists of five large scoops of coconut ice cream and four egg rolls filled with hot bananas.  Another deliciously, decadent dessert.\n\nOur bill before tax and tip comes to $40.50, with lots of leftovers.  For the month of February, purchases of $40 or more will get a $10 gift certificate good through August.  We will be back, but next time with a reservation.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-02-03T18:38:18-0500", "location_id": "1187533", "id": "193019370", "user": {"username": "robert c", "user_location": {"name": "Sunnyvale, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-01", "title": "Great Catering Experience", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33146-d1187533-r192606188-m11068-Ginger_Cafe-Sunnyvale_California.html#review192606188", "text": "We catered lunch from Ginger Cafe for the first time today for our department CNY (Chinese New Year) lunch and had a great experience.  The ordering process included a few calls to Ginger Cafe, more due to questions and decision making on our end; they were more than patient and accommodating.  They recommended 5-6 shallow pan dishes from their catering menu for 16 people.  We took their advice and ordered the following:\n\nCrispy Tofu in Mandarin Sauce\nBasil Chicken\nBeef with String Beans\nChicken Fried Rice \nVeggie Chow Mien\n\nWe also ordered Fresh Shrimp Roll and Lettuce Wrap with Chicken as appetizers. \n\nThe food came piping hot and was delicious.  They provided everything needed such as napkins, utensils, plates, fortune cookies, etc.  The only thing we had to provide was the serving utensils.
