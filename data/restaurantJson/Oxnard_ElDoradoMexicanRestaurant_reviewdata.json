While the kitchen prepared our food, my husband was offered water or something else to drink and enjoyed some great karaoke - in Spanish!!!! He called me on the phone and held it up so I could hear the great singing in the background. Per his observation, the place was busy but service was great and the establishment kept very clean. Now about the food: The chips and pico de gallo are freshly prepared and tasty. My taco salad was huge and delicious. It is very healthy for a taco salad, so if you want cheese or sour cream, you need to request it (I didn't). While rice traditionally tends to be a bit soggy in this entree, this rice was moist but firm, and delicious. My husband had a carne asade burrito that took him two days to eat!\nThe next time we are in town, we will definitely dine in, and, after some liquid encouragement, may even sing a song or two.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-28T11:05:38-0400", "location_id": "10243871", "id": "368519171", "user": {"username": "Noelle K", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}]}
