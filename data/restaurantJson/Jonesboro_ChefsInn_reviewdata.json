Home-made rolls, jalapeno cornbread, special desserts of the day on dessert bar, good salad bar, large selection of daily entrees & sides.  Best service in town.  $10 includes drink.  The downside:  lots of people in the south crave real home cooked chicken & dressing.  Theirs is the best I've had.  BUT....they've stopped putting ANY chicken at all in it....YET still call it \"chicken & dressing\" as a featured entree for Sunday & Wednesday.  When it got down to literally just a few extremely thin hairlike \"threads\" of chicken to be found in the dressing, I voiced a complaint.  I was told they put 60 lbs of chicken in their dressing.  This was simply not true when it was down to threads of the meat and last Sunday, I found not even a thread of chicken.  AND the usually good dressing was watered down and was under baked.  They even have the good \"giblet gravy\" that always sets off a good cornbread dressing....but it's always minus the giblets.  All of their other chicken entrees featured on other days are chock full of chicken:  their chicken & dumplings are the best, there's a Mexican chicken dish full of chicken, fried chicken, baked chicken.....  Chef's Inn.....PLEEEZZZZ get the chicken back in your \"chicken & dressing\" entree or call it a side dish.  PORK CHOP DAY quit being pork chops long ago.  I was told way back then that they fry up 200 chops and substitute w/pork steak when those run out.  But for some time now, it's been strictly pork steak....NO CHOPS EVER.  While that's fine with me (I like the pork steak better), it's not okay with others.  I have relatives who will not go with me now on \"Pork Chop Day\".  And of course, full disclosure, the daily line-up on the paper menu to take home needs to be updated.  CALL IT WHAT IT IS.  SIMPLE.
