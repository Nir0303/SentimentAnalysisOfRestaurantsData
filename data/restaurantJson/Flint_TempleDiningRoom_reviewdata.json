The prices are reasonable, and nothing costs more than 6 or 7 dollars, tops (lunchtime).   Food is ordered from a menu, and is served to your table (not cafeteria style) at lunchtime.

The chairs are upholstered with heavy duty Naugahyde, or something similar, with many, many tacks at the edges (you just don't see these used anymore).
