I was hoping for a fun activity I could do again with the foreign exchange students I work with, but I won't pay $15 again for what I got.  Here's the breakdown:\n\n4 stars for Denton History- this part was actually my favorite!  It was really well done and I enjoyed the historical information.  I'm a lifelong Denton resident and there was a lot presented that I didn't know.  As a straight history tour, it was great!\n\n1.5 stars for the \"ghost\" stories- this was disappointing.  I don't believe in ghosts and this did nothing to change my mind.  Most of the stories were people hearing footsteps and feelings from \"psychics\".  Yawn.  There was no information presented about who the ghosts might have been, just that there probably were ghosts.  \n\n2 stars for the tour itself- 90 minutes and we didn't even get all the way around the square.  We spent 30 minutes inside Recycled Books, which was not worth it to me.  We didn't get to the Courthouse stories, which was disappointing.  We spent too much time at each place, and I think she could've paired down the stories she told about different venues to get us to more buildings- there are only so many stories one should tell about people hearing footsteps before it's overkill.  She said there are different stories on each tour, but I'm not paying that much to potentially get different stories.  \n\n2 stars for the tour guide- I did not find her engaging.  She was rude to the public passing by us, and if she's been at this for four years, I'd expect her to be used to people on the square and find a less abrasive way to deal with the public.  It was a busy Friday night, and we were walking by the busiest places.  Of course people are going to listen in and bug a group like that- but she didn't have to be so short with them.  If she treated me like that, I'd never go on one of her tours.   It made me uncomfortable. \n\nAll in all, if it were a straight history tour, I'd probably go again, but what I got was not worth what I paid.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Shelly T, Owner at Ghosts of Denton, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for the feedback.

I apologize if you thought I was rude to the drunk man who interrupted and to the panhandler, however you might have felt differently if I had allowed them to continue to engage us.  Four years of telling stories on the square has taught me that it's not a good idea to allow that.  As for people who linger to hear stories, I let them hear one.
