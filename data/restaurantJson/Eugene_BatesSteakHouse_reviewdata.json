We where then seated and to look at the menu it was priced at about %800 which is like five star dining normal is anywhere from %300-%500! i did not even want to order but i was on a first date. i ordered prime rib dinner and she ordered filet minonge. first they bring us a cast iron kettle of vegetable soup which was ok the pan was over kill with a four Oz ladle really big ladle whats wrong with serving a bowl of soup? well as a chef I can see some of the behind the scenes details of a plate. the salad was reaaaly small like a soup bowl or five or six bites... id rather have a nice dinner salad while i wait for my food rather then trying to put all the cost of the meal into veg. soup. plain black beans no salt no flavor. when my rib got to me it was missing the lip of the rib it was butchered! less then 8oz more like 6 1/2 0r 6-7. then the thing was luke warm and a real thick layer of sage and other gummie residue on top. while trying to pry through with my steak knife witch was like an over sized butter knife had trouble cutting through it.... also theses potatoes and rice came to the table with the meal just sliced whole not peeled potato rounds plain with rice. when i looked at my dates \"filet minonge\" it looked more like flank steak or some thing? i then googled filet minonge to make sure i was not going to be miss lead when i approached the server about it. so i was correct the filet minonge i say dose not look like the cut of meat we ordered? well for like $40 dollars i expect this to be non disputable plates here. the server then says about it they  are medalions? my date says it was rough to chew on and poor quality as well. now my stomach is acting up on me and im getting a deep belly ache!!! the sever was nice and very thorough she did very well and she gets four stars at putting up with the RIP OFF GRUEL that she has to serve at her job!! even though i did not feel entitled to pay an $88 dollar bill for one cocktail, coffee, prime rib dinner and filet minonge dinner!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-01-15T21:11:04-0500", "location_id": "1025007", "id": "191003546", "user": {"username": "Nathan F", "user_location": {"name": "Eugene, Oregon", "id": "51862"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-07", "title": "My Kind of Place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51862-d1025007-r178997655-m11068-Bates_Steak_House-Eugene_Oregon.html#review178997655", "text": "My wife and I disagree regarding what we choose to eat.
