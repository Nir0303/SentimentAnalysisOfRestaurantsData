It is very impressive and efficient but very antiseptic in appearance.  The glass walls on the street level are a nice touch and give a feeling of open space.  But.....would you believe that in this busy station where thousands travel through daily, there is only ONE RESTROOM which is locked and hidden from sight.  What must the many visitors to our capitol city think?  It took a bit of sleuthing but I finally located THE RESTROOM on the main level behind the information booth which was not occupied.  There is a small sign which says restroom and another sign M/F.  The door was locked & the person inside said they would be right out.  It was an MBTA employee who emerged & told me indeed that was the only restroom and you needed a key.  Since he worked for the T, he had a key and opened the door for me.  I can't believe with all the planning that went into the new station that no one realized the need for restroom for the commuters!  Shame!

It is close to the Boston Garden, Faneuil Hall and the local business offices. I recently became a monthly parker and had to pay for three months in in advance $1,125. The attendant in the office was not very cordial and I hope I don't have to deal with him again. The garage always appears to be under construction and large areas of the garage are taken out of service. However, it never looks like anything is ever improved. The garage is dirty, the stairwells smell like urine, the spaces are small and your car will most assuredly get many dings and scratches. It's great if you like exercise because they usually only have one elevator out of four working and you can wait several minutes. I will say that they have the lowest monthly rate in the area, but it is also the worse garage I have ever used in Boston.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-02-10T06:47:51-0500", "location_id": "6398377", "id": "346582086", "user": {"username": "Jake C", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Key to the city ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d6398377-r298424383-m11068-Government_Center-Boston_Massachusetts.html#review298424383", "text": "No matter where it seems your going in the city.
