They use snow cream from flavored ice blocks (currently offering original, strawberry, green tea and black sesame), and you can add syrups or fruit/toppings. If it's your first time, stick with one of their suggested combos; you can't go wrong that way. Then, after you've got a better sense of what this crazy stuff is, you can be more adventurous.\n\nThe portions are generous IMO, and you could easily share one with a friend...unless you don't want to share. :)They also sell Blockhead popscicles, but I have yet to try those.\n\nAnd lastly, can someone explain to me why this stuff doesn't seem to melt? Get some. You'll see them (noisily) shave the ice block and the cup you get is cold - frozen even. All that is like regular shaved ice. Look closely and you'll see the \"snow\" is more like super thin soap shavings. And they don't melt! It's really weird. I want to get a bowl and just leave it out for an hour to see if it would puddle or something, but that would be such a waste, no? It's probably a question best left unanswered.
