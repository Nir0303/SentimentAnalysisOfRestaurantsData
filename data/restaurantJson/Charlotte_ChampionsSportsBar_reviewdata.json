In need of food quick my group decided to try Champions (inside the Marriott right across the street ). Upon figuring out how to get into Campion's through the Marriott lobby we found seats at the bar. The bartender was nice to begin with but as my friends and I started asking for specialty drinks ( I.E. lemon drop shot and Irish breakfast shot) he got kind of rude. Then the shots were huge but almost to the point where you couldn't enjoy them as they were meant to be enjoyed. The female bartender was talking badly, within ear shot, about a group she was serving. The Nachos were fantastic and so were the sweet potato tater tots. In summation If you go or don't go it won't make or break your trip.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-12-09T08:10:28-0500", "location_id": "5842901", "id": "243695125", "user": {"username": "ashley m", "user_location": {"name": "Sumter, South Carolina", "id": "54457"}}}]}
