But your there for a great breakfast right? Well it was ok at best. Our group had quite a variety from eggs and sausage to crepes. The service was the fair as the waitress messed up ordering one of our meals. She explained she must had picked up the wrong plate in the kitchen. My crepes were just ok as well. The price was higher than I expected for a breakfast and not nearly as good as We get from our local breakfast places back in the Kansas City area.
