For me, it's nice yarns, a decent inventory, nice staff, room to walk around and nice patterns.  This has all of these things!\n\nIt's not the biggest store in the world, but the owner has always been there when I visit and she is not only very nice but very helpful.  She knows her stuff.  Her daughter works there now and is equally knowledgeable;  I'd say that they know different things which is complimentary.  Not a huge selection but what they have is nice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-12T11:41:54-0400", "location_id": "8524633", "id": "298404726", "user": {"username": "minna4201", "user_location": {"name": "Palm Harbor, Florida", "id": "34535"}}}]}
