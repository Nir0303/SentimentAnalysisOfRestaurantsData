It's in a small mall in Rockville town center, there is parking in front and restaurant will validate up to two hours.  The dining room is not big (seats around 30-40 with a communal long table in the middle and seats for mostly 4 on two sides)  and fairly nicely decorated with Chinese accents such as rows of little red lanterns.  And with glass walls on two sides there is a lot of light and didn't feel as cramped as it otherwise would be. We got there just after 7 and had to wait a bit for a table, and it stayed packed even as we finished up.  The diners were about 80% Chinese, majority quite young.  Food was billed to be Northeastern Chinese style and the owner was indeed from Harbin. Noodles are handmade so they stick together a bit, but the flavor was good.  There's an extensive menu for dumplings with a variety of fillings.  We had the chicken mushroom filling and it was very good, just the right size and quite delicate, skin not too thick.  The cumin beef was quite tender, and if you like stuff cooked in soups (more Sichuan style than Northeastern) there's a large selection of that as well.  Not a lot of vegetable dishes but the green beans were well done and delicious.  It actually had the atmosphere of a regional restaurant in a small Chinese town. A bit messy (after all, not a fancy restaurant), what with all the soupy and saucy dishes, and the condiments jars and bottles on the table are not squeaky clean to the touch.  But if you could overlook all that, it is possible to have a tasty and filling meal for a very reasonable price (it averaged around $15 per person for us before tip).  And overall,  the menu is more interesting than your run of the mill Chinese restaurant in the DC area.  Too bad this is a bit out of the way for us, otherwise would definitely be a place worth repeated visits.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-04-13T20:09:25-0400", "location_id": "4713079", "id": "265582857", "user": {"username": "paxa", "user_location": {"name": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "id": "28970"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Great Dumplings!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41353-d4713079-r260050975-m11068-East_Dumpling_House-Rockville_Maryland.html#review260050975", "text": "If you want a comfort meal, this is the place!

The service was good (please allow some extra time for your freshly made dumplings!), and the location is excellent (located beside Rockville Town Center). \n\nI've eaten in the restaurant and gotten take out (again, even for take out, the dumplings are freshly made!). It's a small restaurant, and I don't believe they take reservations. There's outdoor seating available as well, expanding the footprint a bit.
