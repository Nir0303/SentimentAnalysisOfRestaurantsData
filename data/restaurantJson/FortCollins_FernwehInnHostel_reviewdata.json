It is like a B&B but you just cook for yourself in the gourmet foodie grade kitchen or sneak off to the delightful dining recommendations from the staff that abound in Ft Collins.  If you are a bike touring Foodie like myself you can make a fun excursion of your trip by mixing and matching Denver's Trains to Union Station, Deluxe Flatiron Flyer Bus to Boulder and FLEX bus M-Sa to Ft Collins.  The bike routes from Boulder to Ft Collins are sweet too.  Fernweh has a bike library.  Ft Collins has almost as many bike shops as microbrewerys. Super duper hill climbs and trails and urban paths followed by Fernweh's claw footed baths and hammocks are waiting for your visit.  When you look in to the lovely hardwood floors of Fernweh; you'll automatically rip off your bike cleats before entering.  It's that classy.  \n  Travel light and on you way into town, stop by the Natural Grocers excellent travel section for those small overnight items you don't want to haul.  \n  The street out front seems to quiet down around 9pm but earplugs are always a good idea for shared rooms and fan noises.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-12T14:06:26-0400", "location_id": "491714", "id": "381993270", "user": {"username": "walker64064", "user_location": {"name": "Raton", "id": null}}}]}
