The regular pizza looked thin crust and awesome. Unfortunately, I had a personal pie, which is served on a thicker crust. Still good, but I prefer the thin crust, NY style. There are a variety of toppings or pick your own. I did the bacon cheeseburger, with pickle bits included. Very tasty. There are also pasta dishes, calzones, and subs. The restaurant half is clean and bright, and the pub half is darker. We were actually trying to hit Piatti614, but they (despite their website) are not open for lunch. This is a good spot, and it sure beats the chains lining I-29.
