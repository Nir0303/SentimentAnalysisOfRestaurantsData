I have lived in Jupiter Farms for 34 years and have been going to Annie\u2019s with my husband, kids and grandkids for the 22 years it\u2019s been open. I recommend Annie\u2019s to my guests.\n\nIt\u2019s a small Italian Ice parlor where you can go to the outside window or inside where there are a couple of tables.  The venue is old and not fancy but the frozen yogurt (made on site) is the creamiest and freshest that I have ever eaten, and has been consistently so over all these years.  Their Gelatos, (Italian ice and frozen yogurt layered confection) are my favorites.  There is wide choice of flavored Ices. They also serve hot dogs and pretzels.\n\nFor a real treat go to Annie\u2019s, you won\u2019t regret it!\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-20T16:53:59-0400", "location_id": "9777542", "id": "430164751", "user": {"username": "Marietta A", "user_location": {"name": "Jupiter, Florida", "id": "34335"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Homemade Ices", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34335-d9777542-r426481171-m11068-Annie_s_Italian_Ices-Jupiter_Florida.html#review426481171", "text": "The best homehade ices in Florida.
