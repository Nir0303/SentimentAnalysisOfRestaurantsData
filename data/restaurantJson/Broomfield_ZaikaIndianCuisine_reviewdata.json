There is an elephant statue in a small pond with stones, seashells, and koi--very pretty! We were seated at a a glossy, black table near a window.  Granted they weren't busy yet at that early hour, but the servers were very attentive and I felt that they were that way even if they were busy.  Our waiter was ready to answer any questions that we had about the menu including levels of spice from 1-5.  We each ordered our own meal and there was enough to share and sample.  We really enjoyed the garlic naan.  I could have made a meal on that alone! I chose the shrimp masala with a side order of marinated mushrooms which were wonderful!  The portions were large and we all took a little bit home to enjoy another day.  There are no Indian restaurants in our city but I would definitely drive to Broomfield to visit Zaika again.  Very easy to find and plenty of parking!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-01T18:32:24-0400", "location_id": "7191010", "id": "277111433", "user": {"username": "ireland2010Colorado", "user_location": {"name": "Greeley, Colorado", "id": "33454"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "A staple in our lunch rotation", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33330-d7191010-r276069943-m11068-Zaika_Indian_Cuisine-Broomfield_Colorado.html#review276069943", "text": "This is the third Indian restaurant at this location in as many years, but the first worth eating at.
