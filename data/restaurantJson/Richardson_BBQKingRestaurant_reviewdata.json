I cannot get the depth of flavors out of my mind. I wish there was no such thing as getting full because I would sit there all day and just eat everything. \n\nI had the chicken karahi/korma and the wife had the beef karahi/korma and both were nothing short of stupendous. The meat was tender, fall apart at the touch. The flavors were deep and aromatic. The mild sauce had the right amount of kick and both were wonderfully spicy without being overly hot.\n\nThe naan bread was also excellent, not at all greasy. The accompanying rice was perfect. \n\nI also got an app of the samosas and they came with the best chick peas I ever ate. Soft, flavorful, just perfect. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable. The ambience is on the modest side. The service was slow but friendly and helpful. \n\nWe just found our new go-to Indian restaurant.
