It truly was an amazing experience as well as romantic. The conversations were loud, but that didn't bother me a bit. My wife and I arrived 15 minutes prior to our 1830 reservation and were seated immediately in this quaint historical house owned by president Warren G. Harding. Our waiter Joseph was a true professional and Id like to focus first on his service. He was passionate about his job as a server and ensuring a wonderful experience. He was a true gentleman to both my wife and I, and though the place filled up fast, ill quote my wife. \"He made us feel as if we were the only two he was serving.\" He was very intelligent about the menu as if we were hearing it from the chef. I took his recommendations on both the main course and the desert and they were both to die for. The food exceeded our expectation in every way. From presentation, to the timing, to the way that every bite engaged another part of the pallet revealing hints of fresh herbs and spices in the sauces as well as the perfection of the homemade pasta. The tomatoes in the Rigatoni a la Checca (I believe the dish was called) were stewed to a perfection I didn't know was possible. Cooked anymore they'd fall apart, any less and they wouldn't nail that amazing flavor. The veal shank (which was the special) was cooked in an equally delectable way. I believe Id need a degree to describe the flavors! The portions were spot on. Just enough food to fill you up, but not too much to where I felt too full enjoy every bite. Lastly, the desert was Sweet and delicious. Tiramisu served at the perfect temperature consistency and a chocolate tart that had a strong natural cocoa flavor with enough sugar to sweeten it to perfection paired with an authentic Italian Expresso. The attire is business casual, and It would be nice if everyone would stick to that. A few gentleman came underdressed in work t-shirts which was inappropriate for this dining experience. My wife and I will be back. Cell phones are discouraged to be used, but I snuck a few pictures of this amazing Itallian cuisine to share! Thank you The Cellar and Joseph for making my 10th Anniversary a memorable one!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-23T08:05:10-0400", "location_id": "518804", "id": "430903420", "user": {"username": "Neil S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Experience You Won't Forget ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d518804-r430860933-m11068-The_Cellar-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html#review430860933", "text": "My husband took me to this phenomenal restaurant for our 10 year anniversary.

From the moment we walked in, to the second we left, we were made to feel welcomed and special. We had a lovely server, who had the most impeccable manners. We started with a bottle of white wine and a nightly special appetizer of grilled octopus. Delicious! For dinner we ordered the Rigatoni con Gamberi e Asperagi and Osso Buco D'Angelo con Risotto alle Verdure.  Each dish was presented beautifully and tasted even better. The pasta was homemade, cooked al dente, in a light sauce with shaved asparagus and shrimp. The lamb Osso Buco was tender and had a depth of flavor like none other. This is a must go to if you are ever in the area.

Decided to revisit after talking with friends who still highly recommended the restaurant.  The 4 of us were not disappointed.  Everything from the wine to the dessert was exquisite.  The service was properly paced and attentive.  The cost of the meal was expensive, for Daytona, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Reservations are a must and since the restaurant is fairly small must be made well ahead Make sure to try one of the veal dishes and you will not be disapppointed.
