It was easy to get a table and the place was decorated pretty nicely.  The dim sum ordering process here was different from what we were used to.  Instead of picking from wandering food carts, we chose our selection from a reusable writable menu.  The positive aspect of this was that we can see all that is offered and our dishes are made to order.  The negative aspect was that we would be committed to what we ordered and there would be wait for each individual dish to come out.\n\nThe dim sum dishes itself was decent.  There were a few items here that we did not encountered at the other nearby dim sum place.  We liked the pork ribs with noodle rolls dish.  However, we were a bit disappointed with the vegetarian noodle roll dish as the roll was a bit watery.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-06T15:09:31-0500", "location_id": "7933246", "id": "435194989", "user": {"username": "Leo F", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great Cantonese seafood restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41654-d7933246-r386701998-m11068-Yong_Yong_Restaurant-Malden_Massachusetts.html#review386701998", "text": "Excellent Cantonese seafood restaurant outside of Chinatown.

A few days earlier I had spotted this new spot in Malden center, at the intersection of Eastern Ave and Ferry St.  We were not very familiar with \"hot pot\" but it seemed like a break from the ordinary so we went.  We were glad we did.  The place is really 2 or maybe 3 restaurants in one, but all the customers were sitting in the \"hot pot\" side so it was the obvious choice.  We opted for the \"yin-yang\" version (half spicy/half tame) for the broth.  You select from a variety of meats, seafood, and vegetables.  They bring the \"hot pot\" broth and set the pot on a stove-top built into your table.  It started boiling pretty quickly, and they brought out our selections so we could start cooking and eating.  This is an \"all you can eat format\", and includes sushi as well.  We had a spicy salmon roll from that list, but the star was the \"cook your own dinner\" in the \"hot pot\".  The food comes out with the meats sliced very thin and frozen.  The shrimp were whole and frozen too.  It was fun and great.  It took us a while to recognize that there were some utensils on the table (big spoon and slotted big spoon) to aid the cooks, so we struggled a bit at first.  It also was a while before we tried the \"hot-pot sauce\", which turned out to be a soy-ginger flavoring which was excellent.  The other customers were nearly all in small friends or family groups, eating and talking and having fun.  We did too.  There was a big screen with something going on in Chinese, and that ethnic group made up over 80% of the customers, which we think was a very good sign about the place.  If you are interested in a bit of a culinary adventure we recommend this place.  I expect we will be back soon and will be bringing some of our friends with us.
