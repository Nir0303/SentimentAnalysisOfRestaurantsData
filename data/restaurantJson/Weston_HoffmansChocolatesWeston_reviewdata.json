We had dinner in our favorite Peruvian place, Ceviche Arrigato, and found Hoffman on Trip Advisor.\n\nThe ice cream there. may have been the best I've ever eaten.  The chocolate selection, and gifts also looked yummy.  It is a local chain, and all is homemade.  Prices are reasonable, and it's almost worth the hour and a half trip from Naples to go there.  Just go!!!!\n\nFoodie141", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-15T06:36:47-0500", "location_id": "10714868", "id": "437495016", "user": {"username": "Foodie141", "user_location": {"name": "Naples, Florida", "id": "34467"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Incredible chocolates and ice cream", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34733-d10714868-r428916425-m11068-Hoffman_s_Chocolates_Weston-Weston_Broward_County_Florida.html#review428916425", "text": "Every time we visit Weston, we stop in here.
