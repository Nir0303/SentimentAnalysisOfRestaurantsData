I'm impressed that he is proactive to respond/reach out to existing/past patrons... since most new businesses tend to fail within the first 5-10 years.\n\nI was at the mall this afternoon (12/06/15) to try to finish my Christmas shopping, & stopped in with my family. Customer service was night & day from my 1st visit; considering it was linner time & the restaurant was fairly packed, we were attended to promptly. Upon entering, we waited for the hostesses to finish their discussion before one greeted us. I requested to sit in a booth to allow privacy in case I needed to nurse my newborn.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were left to our own devices but we knew what we wanted, then paged our server to inform her of my Yelp check-in deal (50% off any regular price appetizer); she came within in 5-mins., reviewed my order [Pepper Stack Burger (angus beef with pepperjack cheese, roasted poblano pepper, grilled tomatoes & onions, & red pepper aioli on brioche bun), kids chicken tenders (5 pieces of chicken tenders with baby carrots & fries), Burger Bytes appetizers (3 angus beef with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, red onions on mini-brioche buns), & large fries], & sent the ticket to the kitchen.\n\n10-mins. after placing our order & H was almost done drawing on her kids placemat, the sliders & fries came out. My husband said the sliders were much better than the burger from the initial visit. The fries were hot, crispy on the outside & tender on the inside, & minimally salted; they were just slightly too hot to handle so I had the little one eat hers with a fork. We were about 1/3 into the appetizer & side when Nicky reappeared with my burger & daughter's kids meal.\n\nMy burger was cooked perfectly (medium-well)... it was warm & juicy, but lacked flavor/seasoning if it weren't for the pepperjack cheese, poblano pepper, & aioli. The bun was toasted so it held up well during my meal, instead of the ingredients oozing out of it. With each bite, I got a string of ooey-gooey cheese, including my last morsel; my burger was warm from start to finish. =)\n\nH didn't like her chicken tenders & swapped all of them for 1 of my husband's sliders. I asked why she didn't like them... she said the skin [batter] & meat tasted funny. I took a taste & didn't find anything wrong with them other than the batter being a little bland, the chicken itself was tender but under seasoned. We were done in under an hour & my newborn slept through the meal so it was an uneventful dining experience when I was expecting drama from the kids. Whew!\n\nOur server, Nicky, was friendly & efficient. She stopped by at opportune times to drop off our order, checked on us & asked if we needed anything (i.e. condiments, water refills, etc.), & cleared our empty/dirty plates. Upon check-out, I noticed the appetizer discount was applied. This girl was on-the-ball! I was having trouble with my card's magnetic strip & somehow it worked for Nicky; she must have the magic touch or the cards are \"stacked\" against me (yes, pun intended) just to prove how awesome Stacked's/Nicky's customer service. When Nicky returned with my receipt, she threw in an incentive for us to return; scratchers for free food or a prize on our next visit within the incentive's time frame. Upon hearing that, H shouted we HAVE to come back because she loves scratchers & winning something. Sneaky Stacked. ;-)\n\nI find that knowing the menu & exactly what you want helps speed up the online ordering process, & it doesn't hurt to be familiar with their app. I'll reiterate that the food is average & pricey--you don't get the bang for your buck here, but customer service was much improved on this visit. I think the price point should be adjusted in comparison with other build-your-own-burger restaurants... as some Yelpers noted, there are better options available.\n\nHere's another tip, Stacked: I noticed there were quite a few family patrons with young children. Have you considered installing some games on the iPad to keep them entertained? It'll save you the expense of printing kids placemats & buying crayons, it's more green/environmentally-friendly. Granted, the kids might prefer to game instead of eating, but it'll keep them entertained longer until the food arrives & when they finish their meal before the adults.\n\nThis is a 3.5 rating instead of 4 due to taste & value. Would I come back? Yes, especially when you have a 5-year old that will keep reminding you of the potential prize that you will win. :-)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-15T17:47:01-0500", "location_id": "3725195", "id": "333179313", "user": {"username": "Kimberly L", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Not as good as last time", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33182-d3725195-r327617909-m11068-STACKED_Food_Well_Built-Torrance_California.html#review327617909", "text": "I had the gluten free burger last year.  very good.

If you want it on the side, drag the picture in the space between the burger pic and the listing on the right.  There are so many choices!  There must have been 15 sauce choices for the burger - not just catsup, mustard or mayo.  If you see something on the menu for another entree and it's not listed on the right menu, simply ask and they'll add it to your entree.  I ordered a cranberry walnut salad with chicken.  It had spinach, cranberries, walnuts, smoked applewood bacon, red onions, avocado, Point Reyes blue cheese and a whole cut up chicken breast.  I could have switched the spinach for one of 8 lettuce offerings.  My friend had a prime rib sandwich (8 oz!) with au jus.  Both meals were ample servings.  We did order a large shoestring french fry.  They were done to perfection.  It could have easily fed three people.

The food was good, not great, and wasn't overly quick being served.  The restaurant was a bit dark and somewhat minimalistic in the table set-up.  Not bad, but no real wow.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-22T06:40:37-0400", "location_id": "3725195", "id": "282086138", "user": {"username": "Kevin L", "user_location": {"name": "Maumee, Ohio, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33182-d3725195-r279411662-m11068-STACKED_Food_Well_Built-Torrance_California.html#review279411662", "text": "This place is awesome!

Perfect if you are grapping a bite before movie for example. At your table you will find an ipad that you can scroll through the menu to pick your appitzers drinks food and dessert.  You literally begin to stack your ingredients on your burger, pizza or salad.  There are a variety of cheeses, meats, sauces lettuce and bread to choose from to stack to perfection.  Each person takes turns at the ipad then you push the send to kitchen button and you are done.  In a few your waiter will pop up at your table with your meal.  You can also pay right when you finish ordering or you can wait to the end of your meal either way you dont have to flag down a busy waiter you just swipe you card and go.  There is also a button to split the check and you can use multipe cards as well as call for a waiter and pay cash.  If you pay at the beginging and decide you want dessert you simply swipe your card again and stack your ice cream sandwich etc... and hit that send to kitchen button again. I love the fast service and the hands on approach to this restaurant. They also have happy hour and a full bar. Ilove their skinny fries with the curry ketchup or aiola sauce", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-11-24T16:41:08-0500", "location_id": "3725195", "id": "241338710", "user": {"username": "Niketa C", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Wonderful Customizing But Nothing More", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33182-d3725195-r232789037-m11068-STACKED_Food_Well_Built-Torrance_California.html#review232789037", "text": "It was an...okay experience. The i-pad creates a fun and unique method of ordering food, and it's great for customization. There is a wide variety of options. After we ordered, we waited for a long while. and when it finally came, I was kind of disappointed that the food was a little cold- as if it had been sitting for quite a while. It would have definitely tasted better if it was warm. The service was nothing special, the servers were just doing their job and nothing more.The space inside though was very spacious. Because they had the football game on the TV, there were a couple other customer who got overly noisy and excited when their team made a goal, but that's understandable. If I had to, or circumstances provide that I go to that area again, I would eat here just for the fun of customization.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-05T18:52:40-0400", "location_id": "3725195", "id": "232789037", "user": {"username": "Erika H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Excellent options - wide variety", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33182-d3725195-r224580697-m11068-STACKED_Food_Well_Built-Torrance_California.html#review224580697", "text": "We love this place.
