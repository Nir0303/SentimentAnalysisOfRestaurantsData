The appetizer (fried mozzarella) arrived quickly and was very good.  My daughter had a meatball sub, which was good however the bread was burned on a quarter of the sandwich, but they did offer to replace it however they should have noticed before sending it out.  The pizza was hot and tasty but had to be sent back because one of the toppings was missing from one side of the pizza.  The order was a little confusing having one topping only on half and the other covering the entire pizza, but it was fixed quickly.
