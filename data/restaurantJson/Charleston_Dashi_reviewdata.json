Fast forward a few months and while at a Healing Arts fair in the West Ashley area, the organizers brought in this food truck as a healthy gastronomic option for attendees at the fair.\n\nMy wife and I hungry for some food this time jumped at the opportunity to eat there versus a sit-down diner somewhere.  Sharon had the Pad Thai with fresh local veggies.  I opted for the quesadilla special stuffed with all kinda goodness.  Both of us opted for the ginger-lemonade.\n\nAll in All a very satisfying dining experience and our gal at the window was quite friendly and all in the truck on this fairly hot day were pleasant despite the high temperatures.\n\nLatin-Asian Fusion... well that is a new one on me, should they open up a brick-and-mortar shop, count me as 1st in line to dine.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-28T03:34:36-0400", "location_id": "10794656", "id": "411748767", "user": {"username": "JPSaleebyMD", "user_location": {"name": "Charleston, South Carolina", "id": "54171"}}}]}
