The interior was dirty the first time I ate inside, the next  time I couldn't even eat at a table because it was VERY DIRTY, I took my food to my car and ate there. There is no excuse for everyone's cups and old burger wrappers spewn about everywhere. I understand this is not a full service restaurant and customers are responsible for putting their own garbage in the trash can but if they don't do it themselves staff SHOULD be cleaning up after them! The girl who took my order twice was rude and unfriendly, she rolled her eyes when I wanted extra pickles no mayo. I do not use this Wendy's location at all anymore and neither should you.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-29T11:48:33-0500", "location_id": "4136295", "id": "329790695", "user": {"username": "busylizzzy P", "user_location": {"name": "Tyngsboro, Massachusetts", "id": "41870"}}}]}
