He said \"10 minutes\" & it was.  \n\nHand-tossed crust was light & possibly the best I've had.  Ingredients were larger than the usual tiny processed bits.  Sauce & cheese just right.  \n\nLeftover slices were still tasty after being warmed up in the oven.\n\nDecor package was very attractive & comfortable.  Shiny clean everywhere.  Inviting to dine-in.
