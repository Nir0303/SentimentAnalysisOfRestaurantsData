Likewise the chicken swarma was uninspired, smothered in the same garlic sauce and confined in a too-large wrap for $9.  We both ended up eating the contents with a fork and throwing away half of the flour wrap.    \n\nWe were the only customers at 12:30 in the afternoon,  so this is obviously not a local favorite for lunch.

We are a successful and thriving Mom &Pop restaurant. We work hard and take great pride in the freshness and quality of our food. It's a comfort food made daily fresh with love. \n\nAs everyone knows, taste is relative and a matter of cultivated palates. Fortunately, 99% of our customers love our authentic MiddleEastern food and don't share your opinion. \n\nWith due respect, and for correcting the record, I like to respond to your unfactual statements. First, we don't use tortillas, we use lavash bread from a special bakery in San Francisco. Second, we don't reheat the lamb. We use fresh raw lamb that is popular and has a large following. Third, salty is a matter of taste, some customers tell us we are light on the salt and ask for a salt shaker. For your bread comment, we also have plates without the bread. And for the \"smothering sauce,\" we have clients who tells us light on the sauce, or extra sauce, or no sauce at all, and some prefer it on the side. We are happy to oblige every request. We are famous for accommodating special requests, and special dietary needs, like dairy or gluten free.\n\nOur food is made fresh and prepared from scratch every day. Much care, passion, and love goes into cooking it. Hope you come back and ask me to show you what I am cooking for you. I will be happy to meet you in person and see if we can change your mind:)", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-04-16T13:50:51-0400", "id": "364688112"}, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-14T15:32:56-0400", "location_id": "3490199", "id": "364248337", "user": {"username": "DoctorM", "user_location": {"name": "Bend, Oregon", "id": "51766"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Great Mediterranean Cafe", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51766-d3490199-r334648618-m11068-Mazza_Bistro-Bend_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html#review334648618", "text": "We were dying for some Lebanese food and ventured into Mazza Bistro.

He brought us his home made hot sauce, which was subtle, smokey and just the right degree of burn to complement but not overwhelm the food.  Everything was excellent.  The baba ganoush is most excellent.

Alas it was still working out the bugs and we kinda forgot about it. Wandering by the other day we decided to give it a second chance and they've gotten a lot of their issues worked out. We came in right behind a big group of mixed ages (maybe the kids, parents and grand parents) who didn't have a clue. With counter ordering this is a disaster for a two-ball like us but the owner snapped over to the other station and took our order while they were looking at the board. It took a bit--it was mid weekend afternoon and the place was pretty full and there had been some to-go phone in orders--but we got our food hot and freshly made. The falafel was crisp outside and soft and moist inside. The pitas were the same. The wraps were large (probably a half for girls and a full for boys) and loaded with veggies. It was an interesting touch to ask if we wanted tahini which tells you something about the middle eastern food sophistication of this market.
