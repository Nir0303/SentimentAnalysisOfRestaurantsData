The wait was 45 minutes and they set you up in an app which is nice because you can walk around. The hostess was very nice. Likewise, our waitress was friendly and accommodating. We started with calamari as that is my 9 yo son's go to. He wouldn't touch it-very chewy and the oil was obviously old as the color was too dark. The menu didn't seem to have many lighter options, the vast majority of the dishes feature a cream sauce. We ended up getting a large salad and the Capri signature dish which was cheese tortellini  with crab and a pesto cream sauce. I don't know why any  restaurant would have their signature dish feature crab with imitation, but this is fault for ordering this in Bryan when we had been in napa the weekend before. So, overall, cute spot, nice atmosphere, good people, stick with something basic like spaghetti.
