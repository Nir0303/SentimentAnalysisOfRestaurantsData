First time there and I loved it. When we walked in we were greeted warmly by the guy behind the counter who just happened to be the owner himself. He and his fiancee own the place and you can tell by the way they treat their customers. The food is fresh and very good. Its like a subway type format but much better with a large variety of pita combos. I had the Gyro pita and my wife had the veggie falafel pita. Very easy and quick. You can eat in or to go. Again much like subway.

I was greeted by three very friendly, smiling employees when I walked through the door.  Together they explained the concept, the food, etc.  And one of them made a recommendation for my pita sandwich; the gyro meat pita, lamb and beef, which I chose, for $7.39.  The pitas were white or wheat and I chose the later.  I was offered double meat for an additional .99 which I accepted.  It was \"double meat Wednesday,\" so double meat was .99 instead of $2.29.  There were LOTS of fresh toppings to choose from and I added hummus, black olives, feta, fresh spinach, fresh cucumber slices, and a couple of other things that I can't remember right now.  The young lady who \"built\" the sandwich was very helpful and the quantities she put on were just the way I asked for them to be.  I was really impressed w/ the amount and freshness of the selections!  As I was w/ all three employees!  They were friendly and offered GREAT customer service and were very enthusiastic about the place and the food.  They really made me feel like a valued customer!  The sandwich was awesome and I ended up having to take half of it home.  I noticed that Pita Pit serves breakfast all day and that menu really sounded interesting!  I was a happy and satisfied customer when I left and I WILL be back!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-10-04T10:32:10-0400", "location_id": "8692828", "id": "316096107", "user": {"username": "Dennis M", "user_location": {"name": "Salem, Virginia", "id": "58156"}}}]}
