My wife and I both found our meals a bit bland, but side dishes were super. I had a bite of the special lamb ragu and wish I had ordered that rather than the cod.  Great draft beer selections. I hope we'll have the chance for a meal there again sometime.

I have had fabulous meals that made me swoon and I have had meals that kept me from returning for months. Last night we had one of those mediocre experiences. It was our 44th wedding anniversary and, hoping Finch's would have a super daily meal, we went there to celebrate. The special was halibut, one of my favorites when prepared properly. I ordered that, though I was concerned that it would be prepared on their open hearth oven. My husband had his usual small pizza, which are always good. Sadly, the halibut arrived (very small portion for $32) and I could tell by looking at it that it was overcooked. Nevertheless, I tried it and, yes, it was dry and very salty. The bed of risotto looked appealing but I sent the meal back and asked for their brassiere burger. The burger was great, as were the fries and truffle aioli that came with it. But, $18 for a burger is a bit much. We will return but probably only for a luncheon pizza. The staff are always courteous and knowledgeable and, in this instance, very willing to make the meal right do me. I did appreciate that. You should try Finch's.

I booked the reservation very late (Saturday morning of the reservation) but the staff was very helpful in finding us a table.  We arrived on time and were seated right away.  The Restaurant was full, but didn't feel too crowded.  \n\nThe beer list was well thought out, with 7 or so craft brews on tap and a huge selection of bottle/can brews.  There was a fairly larger wine list; although, I didn't take a peek as none in our party was interested in wine.\n\nThe menu appeared to be typical American (with a little French influence), but with a twist.  As an example, my wife had Rabbit Cacciatore, a pasta dish, that she really enjoyed.  My youngest son had a wood fired pizza and it disappeared quickly.   My Snapper, the fish of the day, was very nice and very flavorful.\n\nOur wait staff was efficient and very helpful in understanding menu offerings.  \n\nI'm certain we will be back.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-24T13:42:40-0500", "location_id": "803550", "id": "342447091", "user": {"username": "rpenczek", "user_location": {"name": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Simply the Best", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36942-d803550-r318805689-m11068-Finch_s-Bloomington_Indiana.html#review318805689", "text": "Look, I worked in the restaurant industry in Bloomington for 8 years and there's no place better than Finch's. You will get the best steak, mussels, rotating freshly caught fish, pizza, beer, salads, desserts... you get the drift. Oh did I mention the pizza and beer? With an always rotating draft selection and the 2nd best selection of bottles (only to No Coast Reserve) you can pair the best gourmet pizza in town with a one-of-a-kind ale. Truly an amazing dining experience, complemented by well-trained staff.
