We were courteously greeted, and seated immediately.  Despite a large group ahead of us, our service was initially quick.  I ordered sushi, and when it arrived, I realized I'd forgotten to ask for no seeds.  So I asked to have it wrapped up for home and ordered the same meal without seeds.  The fast service ended there.  In fact, I believe the waitress forgot all about bringing that meal for some time, when actually she should have rushed it.  The sushi was a shrimp tempura and was not at all generous with the shrimp.  Further, the roll was filled with fried tempura batter bits.  In this way the roll was made to look larger, while offering nothing in the way of health or nutrition. It seemed like a way to trick the consumer to me, and I didn't appreciate that. The roll also seemed to be missing the avocado it was supposed to have and had another ingredient it wasn't supposed to have.  You might ask why I didn't complain.  It was because I was so hungry by then I'd have eaten almost anything! My brother enjoyed his meal, but did not consider it to be anything special.  The price was not exorbitant, but it wasn't inexpensive either, and was overcharge considering what we got and the fact that mine was \"beefed up\" with fried bits of batter. The only thing we really liked about the place was the decor, and that's not enough to bring us back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-01T21:55:02-0400", "location_id": "871966", "id": "413741154", "user": {"username": "Laura H", "user_location": {"name": "Pompano Beach, Florida", "id": "34571"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Food is fair, location smell needs some attention", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34677-d871966-r381478360-m11068-Thai_Curry-Tamarac_Broward_County_Florida.html#review381478360", "text": "We had lunch at Thai Curry.

It looked gorgeous and tasted even better. Although the window had a sign reading, \"now serving sushi,\" the menu did not contain any sushi items. For thai food, you will not be disappointed in the quality, and the price was right!   Of note, they probably do a large take-out business as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-08-23T09:41:28-0400", "location_id": "871966", "id": "173675247", "user": {"username": "Jegsavnerdeg", "user_location": {"name": "NYC Pal", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "Disappointed", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34677-d871966-r142098207-m11068-Thai_Curry-Tamarac_Broward_County_Florida.html#review142098207", "text": "I discovered this restaurant years ago and it had been consistently excellent. Freshly prepared food, charming atmosphere and attentive service. I returned within the last month and was disappointed. The service was inefficient, the wait endless and the food was tasteless. The staff seemed quite overwhelmed with only three tables (maybe they were short a waiter?) and we sat and sat waiting for our food. The curry and pad thai are still good, but we tried some different dishes and were completely dissatisfied. The coconut shrimp, for example, had flavor at all. I mentioned this to the server and got zero reaction, so I highly doubt we will return.
