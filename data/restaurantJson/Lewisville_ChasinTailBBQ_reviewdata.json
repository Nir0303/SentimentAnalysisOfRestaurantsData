Located in Old Town, Chasin Tail BBQ fits right into the ambience of the area. Locals and travelers will appreciate the casual atmosphere that permeates this establishment. Any dress is appropriate----although a button down and tie might make you a little over-dressed---but, hey---who eats BBQ in a tie anyway??!! Don't miss an opportunity to eat good BBQ at a reasonable price.

We were familiar with the Lake Dallas location and when we were rolling through downtown Lewisville and saw it we figured we would make this our dinner destination.  The store appears to relatively new as there was not a huge crowd at the early dinner hour.  It features counter service where you walk up and place your order and they bring the food to your table once it is ready.  Of the dishes we had (pulled pork, turkey, jalapeno sausage) all were good.  The sauces are at the table for you to add yourself so you eliminate the too much/too little sauce debate.  One of the nice features is that banana pudding is one of the available sides, so my son and I each got one veggie side and the banana pudding so we would have dessert.  My biggest issue with this place is the metal chairs scrapping against the concrete floor.  Almost as bad as nails on a chalkboard.  Overall good and we would definitely go back if we were in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-28T12:55:29-0400", "location_id": "10490838", "id": "387190475", "user": {"username": "magicandbird", "user_location": {"name": "Little Elm, Texas", "id": "56175"}}}]}
