I only grabbed food from the hot bar once and was disappointed, as the veggies were very salty. I threw them away because they were too salty toe at. So, stick with the salad bar. The employees are helpful and friendly as well. The shop also stocks beer and wines if you are looking for something special to drink.

Several vendors are inside I specifically went to S&W Specialty market. The market serves sandwiches along with a salad bar that has hot food. The Salad bar is $7.95 per pound which seems high to me but, the wife says it is comparable to what you find in stores like Krogers, Fresh market. I got salad along with some of the hot food items. Two loaded plates and two iced teas ran $26. The market also had a good collection of craft beers. Another vendor is Cork and Crust which is a little bar area. Another area houses Caf\u00e9 16 a nice looking upscale coffee shop.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-09-28T03:25:51-0400", "location_id": "4930361", "id": "178924052", "user": {"username": "a1scuba", "user_location": {"name": "Virginia", "id": null}}}]}
