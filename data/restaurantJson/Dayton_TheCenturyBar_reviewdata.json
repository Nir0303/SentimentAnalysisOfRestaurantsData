I am not a Bourbon drinker, but my husband is and I have been wanting to bring him here for a while. We were not disappointed. First the bar area with the wood canopy is beautiful, this is a historic canopy bar that you will probably not find in too many places anymore. \n\nWe were fortunate to have several drinks made in front of us at the bar to help us decide what to try. I've read that even if you are not bourbon drinker that they can make a drink that you will like and it's true! My husband had a traditional Old Fashion and I had a new cocktail that is their take on a summer shandy beer. First sip tasted like pure liquor, but it grew on me very quickly and it was over ice so it was very nice and very refreshing. Also lucky enough to see what I would like to try next time and tried a small taste of a traditional Whiskey Sour, awesome! \n\nThese are traditional cocktails folks...no purple hooters here! Enjoy the atmosphere, strike up a conversation with the couple sitting next to you at the bar and Drink Responsibly :) Definitely going back to The Century Bar!
