Homestead Historic Town Hall Museum also holds an immense archive of papers collected by Isabella Krome, daughter of William Krome. The Krome family is responsible for surveying South Florida to allow the Florida East Coast Railway to continue down to the Keys. I found a link to video that help explain the Museum.
