The place is generally busy so if too many people is a problem try coming at a time before lunch or between lunch and dinner. They make the food when you order so calling your order in advance would be your best bet. They have one of the best cheesesteaks I have had. I recommend their signiature cheesesteak which is known as the the Steel City Cheesesteak.  They also have burgers, fish, chicken, pizza puffs, and breakfast.
