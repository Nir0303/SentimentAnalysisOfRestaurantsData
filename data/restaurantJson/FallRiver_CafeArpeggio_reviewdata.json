The food was amazing and very fresh and healthy. The service was pretty good, the people were very friendly until my dad (69 and hard of hearing) thought someone had called out his order and proceeded to eat what had been brought out. When the next order came out, it became clear that my dad had started eating my order. It was not a big deal, since we are related and I didn't mind eating the rest of my meal after him (the orders are pretty big anyway.) The waitress offered to remake the sandwich, but only after she made it clear that my dad was at fault for the mix up. It was pretty rude the way she was talking to him, a 69 year old man! But, we are Idahoans and we're used to people being friendly. I would return to Cafe Arpeggio for the food alone, despite our rude waitress. Everyone else was very nice.

We are so glad we did .... The coffee (both hot and iced) was FABULOUS! I love my coffee (usually drink single origin Kenya/Guatemala/Rwanda coffees)  and this coffee was really really good. Also they had a wonderful selection of vegetarian salads/sandwiches for those who wished to abstain as well as Egg/Sausage on a croissant for those you wanted to indulge. Best of all, they make their own ice cream and have 103 different flavors in total and rotate around 20 or so available at any one time .....\n\nIf this wasn't enough, pricing was very modest and the service staff were just phenomenal. We wished we could have stopped by every day for fresh coffee and ice cream but unfortunately we were staying in Newport, RI. \n\nWe will definitely be back .... This is a MUST TRY Cafe so please take advantage and try their wonderful menu selections.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-07-06T20:20:20-0400", "location_id": "837249", "id": "214012056", "user": {"username": "eminker", "user_location": {"name": "New York, New York, United States", "id": null}}}]}
