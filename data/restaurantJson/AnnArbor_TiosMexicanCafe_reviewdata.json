We put in our order and hung out chatting and laughing. Unfortunately our order got lost somewhere and suddenly we realized that we'd been waiting almost an hour for our food. But the staff were all so apologetic and sincere about it that we weren't even mad! \n\nOnce they realized the mistake, our food came out super quick and it was DELICIOUS!! We really felt taken care of and we totally understand that sometimes things like that happen. It was how well they treated us and how well they took care of the situation that will ensure we definitely come back the next time we are in town.
