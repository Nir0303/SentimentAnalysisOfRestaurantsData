But when we actually got to the building, it was a dilapidated school that was built in 1914 (it was not maintained well).  We walked in the door; there were no signs or maps of any kind, nor people to greet you.  In the building, we were the only ones there.  We found some placards on the wall that talked about Mesa's history.  We read a few of them, then a few minutes later, a woman came out of a doorway from an old classroom.  She asked, \"Can I help you?\"  I replied, \"We don't know where to go.\"  Then she told us that this branch was closed, and then she shooed us out of the building right on the spot!  She was so rude.  We asked her when this branch of the museum is reopening -- she said it is closed permanently.  We felt especially unwelcome when she locked the door behind us on the way out!  What horrible customer service!  And there were no signs saying the building was closed to the public.  Never go to the N. Horne location -- it is apparently permanently closed.
