Our cocktails were delivered in short order. She was most personable and entertained us with the history of the restaurant and its' name. The location had once been Thomas Alva Edison's laboratory, hence the name, and a bank in its' next reincarnation.

The salad would have been more successful if baby kale had been used and grilled before presentation. The dressing was served on the side, which was appreciated.\n\nOur entrees were delivered in a timely manner and our drinks replenished. My Steak Frites was prepared perfectly! A generous cut of NY Strip that was beautifully seasoned, tender and delicious. The Frites were hot and crisp However the grilled asparagus was almost cold. Briannne asked how we were enjoying our meal and immediately replaced the asparagus with a plate that was freshly grilled. My husbands meal was equally delightful. Brianne attended to our every need without being intrusive, even as the restaurant became filled to near capacity. \n\nDessert was a decadent cheesecake with dark cherry sauce that was generous enough for two!

It is literally next to The Rock so very convenient for any event there.  We started with the cajun shrimp and grits appetizer.  This was excellent, not too spicy and they were served on what I would call a grit pancake.   Excellent but it was pricey considering there were only 3 shrimp and the grit cakes were half dollar size.  \n\nI had the Pat LaFrieda burger and my wife had the chicken sandwich.  Both were very good - large portions of meat and chicken.  The homemade garlic and herb fries served with both were excellent.  A large portion and they were fresh cut, not frozen.  $14 may seem expensive for each but they were well worth it.  When you consider that inside the Rock you'd pay $10 for a precooked, frozen burger with cardboard fries it is a good value. \n\nThe restaurant and bar was not crowded at all which was enjoyable.  Most of the other local spots are usually packed and extremely noisy.   Not so here.  They offer several different draft beers and they were also good.   Our waitress Blanca was very helpful and was always checking on us to ensure we had what we needed.  \n\nIf you are going to a Devil game or any other event at the Rock I would highly recommend Alva.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "William G, Manager at Alva Tavern, responded to this review", "text": "I am happy that you enjoyed your meal and experience with us at Alva Tavern.
