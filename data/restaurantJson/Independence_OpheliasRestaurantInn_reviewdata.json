The atmosphere is very nice, great wine, good service and the food was delicious. \nI had stuffed salmon and my husband had the chicken shrimp pasta. Both were excellent and more than enough. We had a dinner salad and bread. The bread is served with three kinds of butter.\nWe WILL go back. There is a piano in the dining area, would love to go back when someone is playing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-26T16:16:56-0400", "location_id": "390829", "id": "397701691", "user": {"username": "Nadine W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Fabulous food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60849-d390829-r397558167-m11068-Ophelia_s_Restaurant_Inn-Independence_Missouri.html#review397558167", "text": "We have eaten here on several special occasions, the most recent was a birthday.
