It was a disappointment. I've never started a restaurant review talking about ambiance. But this place is so lacking in that regard, I have to start there because it hits you in the face as soon as you walk in the dining room. The walls need painting and some kind, any kind, of artwork, fixtures, something. The tables are dark wood, some round, some square, none with table clothes. Even the napkins are dark, so they offer no contrast or color, either. The lighter wood chairs, which are on wheels and don't go with the tables, look like they came from a 1970s Holiday Inn coffee shop. The lights were too bright for dinner time and the temperature in the room almost required a sweater. The whole scene was bland and unappealing. \n\nThe setting wasn't helped by the fact that only one other table, out of about 20, was occupied. One table on the outside patio, which is quite nice, was occupied but the people there were smoking so we opted not to go out there. A couple of other people were at the bar, as was the person who appeared to be the manager.\n\nThe tapas setup, which is brought to every table is nice and tasty. We enjoyed it. We then ordered a Mediterranean sampler plate as an appetizer, which was pretty good but none of the items were particularly noteworthy. For our entree, we split an order of the lobster ravioli. Some of the pasta was cooked properly, while other pieces of it were almost dry and yellowed, as if those had been prepared well before the other or had been left under a warming light far too long. The filling in the ravioli was very good but its delicate taste was completely overwhelmed by the heavy tomato cream sauce on which the pasta was served. That sauce was good on its own, but it wasn't compatible with the ravioli. For dessert we tried the chocolate cheese cake. It, too, seemed tired and shelf weary. Between the two of us, we ate no more than half of it. I had coffee and my wife had Baileys and coffee and both were served barely lukewarm.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was the service. It was outstanding (thank you, Pauline); very friendly and attentive.

I ordered the lamb kabob, and my companion ordered the Beef kabob.  each dish comes with a choice of 1 of the 4 'sides' listed : French Fries, Rice Pilaf, Rosemary Potatoes, and 'Basil,Tomato,Garlic' Pasta - referred to as 'BTG Pasta'   \nI chose the Rosemary potatoes, which I found uninspiring.   My companion wanted none of those, but asked if he could substitute the Mushrooms from the Side Dishes section of the menu.  the waiter said there would be an additional charge. what he didn't say was you'll pay full price for the side dish ($7).   While the mushrooms were really good my companion would have preferred the rice pilaf and the $7 in his pocket. .... anyway - the kabobs were perfectly prepared. Both of us were very pleased with the presentation.   as this was a business lunch, we did not indulge in the wine choices, which are considerable.  nor did we try the desserts.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-02-10T09:39:17-0500", "location_id": "9838798", "id": "346647619", "user": {"username": "Nancy P", "user_location": {"name": "Bakersfield, California", "id": "32037"}}}]}
