Larger, brand new, on the streetcar line, now 1 block from the parade route and St Charles Avenue and featuring the same great staff. The owners brought over all the super-cool decor from the original VooDoo II-- the beaded baby grand piano, the Marie Laveau artwork, the 'leg-bottom' cocktail tables and now, a pool table. Done up nicely with a great sound system/jukebox it's definitely the new, hot, downtown hangout. The owner tells me food is planned as well. Comfy place, prices nice, great service from Rene' and Natalie, 6 big screens and great drinks.
