The family that works there/owns it/runs it is very nice.  I enjoyed reading about their story in the newspaper clipping on the wall and the etymology of the word \"pupusa.\"  I also was entertained by the bathroom signs.  HOWEVER, I concur with Martin C, this place is pricier than most Salvadorean places, and I was seriously disenchanted to wait for over 30minutes to get a takeout order.  By the time I got my food, a whole bunch of other people had gotten theirs (yes they might be regulars and close personal friends because it did have that vibe but I was hungry) and I was actually pretty upset- to the point I will not go back.  \n\nThe food: In first place are the plantains- seriously delicious, though I did not like the funky crema (smells and tastes a little too much like processed cheese dip for my taste).  It is tempting to go back for those, but I think I will be OK.\n\nIn second place is the pupusa revuelta (stuffed pupusa).  My roommate, who had never had Salvadorean food before, liked the filled pupusa.  I thought they were good but kind of expensive compared to the last place I had pupusas (still in California).\n\nThe dish I would not bother getting again was the Plato Salvadoreno tipico (thin sliced beef steak with salad, rice and beans with non-filled pupusa on the side.

My wife wanted to order the caldo de pollo (chicken soup) which was an outrageous $9.90. Thankfully they didn't have it the day we visited Las Comadres.
