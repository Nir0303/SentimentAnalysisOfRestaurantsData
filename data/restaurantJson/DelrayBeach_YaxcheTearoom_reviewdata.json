The outdoor porch is a great place to relax or read while you enjoy your tea.

The tea was fantastic. The food was fantastic. The feel and vibe? Fantastic. There used to be a place similar to this in West Palm and I'm so glad that there is finally another great little tea house. \n\nThe teas decorate the wall and walking in is like walking into a candy shop. Yes, it's a bit overwhelming with so many choices. But with the help of the staff, they make choosing the perfect tea incredibly easy. The food was also fantastic. Gluten free and vegan options also available, is that's your thing.\n\nAll in all, the Yaxche Tearoom is definitely worth visiting whether you're a local looking for something new and exciting or on vacation and looking to get a taste of Delray.
