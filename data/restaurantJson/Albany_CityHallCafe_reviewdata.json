It is a place for people who work in the area (including temporary jurors) to stop by for a quick, inexpensive breakfast or lunch.  In that, it perfectly fulfills its purpose.\n\nLunch lines are not especially long, but if you want to make sure you get in and out quickly, stop by or phone BEFORE work and let them know what you'll want (to eat in or take out) by what time and they will have it ready.  You can then go to a faster line to just pick it up and pay.\n\nThey offer the same standard fare every day plus different daily offerings.  The portions are generous, and the food fresh and delicious.  The prices are slightly less than what you'll find for similar things nearby, although still a lot more expensive than packing a bag lunch.\n\nIn case it's not clear, I gave it five stars not because it is a five-star restaurant but because it is perfect for its class.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-07-11T07:29:47-0400", "location_id": "420478", "id": "287893892", "user": {"username": "Paulette999", "user_location": {"name": "Albany, New York", "id": "29786"}}}]}
