That said, about  Miss SOUR PUSS, the food was very good and reasonably priced. We got the Thursday special combo, which was the salami sandwich, chips and a drink for 5.00. My husband liked the food so well he ordered another sandwich for his lunch the following day. One other caveat, if you have an ample backside like me, those little chairs at the little tables are uncomfortable.
