They were busy, and obviously understaffed because the service was severely lacking. We ordered a sandwich/soup combo, and a salad/soup combo. The sandwich was skimpy, both cups of soup were barely lukewarm. the shrimp & grits had fantastic flavor and would  have been sheer delight it it had been hot. The salad was good.\n\nAfter lunch we went to the counter to pay and to pick up the cheesecake slices, WHICH WEREN'T READY! Dana asked us to come back in an hour (a HUGE inconvenience) and rather than apologize for the inconvenience she gave a whole list of excuses. We came back and hour later, and THEY STILL WEREN'T READY and we had to stand there and wait for another 20 minutes!!!\nShe gave more excuses, never apologized and offered no concession. If I didn't need the cheesecake for the party I would have walked out. \n\nI understand having a busy day, and that things do happen, but making excuses rather apologizing and offering some sort of concession for the inconvenience is very poor customer service indeed.
