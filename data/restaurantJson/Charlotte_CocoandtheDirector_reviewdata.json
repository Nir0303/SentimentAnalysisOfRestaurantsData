The intersection of Trade and Tryon looks like it will be the next hot location with Coco, Essex across the street and the new Bank of America Plaza opening next Spring.\n\nI had a cinnamon and brown sugar latte which was amazing.  I picked out the banana bread from the bakery display.  It was delicious and totally different than the typical sliced loaf.  This was more cake-like and lighter with a crumble topping.  I saw a lot of other things I would like to try next time.  They also have some sandwiches and salads.  Prices are very reasonable.
