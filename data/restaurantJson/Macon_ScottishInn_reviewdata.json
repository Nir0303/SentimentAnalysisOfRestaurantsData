Our shower was grungy with hair all in it, the toilet constantly ran which meant that water covered our floor, there was hair in our beds, dirt on our sheets, etc.. We asked for a smoking room and then we were given a non-smoking room, then come to find out our smoke detector had no battery in it, there was a \"jail bar\" kind of thing on the sliding glass door and a padlock on the front door. The outlets in the walls pushed thru to the other room next door. We asked for a refund on our room and they posted a sign \"no refunds after 15 minutes of check in\" I see why that sign is there, no one with any common sense would want to stay after making it in that door of that room. We looked online at this hotel and read the accommodations of this hotel and not one was correct, false advertisement, microwave? not. Internet? Yeah but dial up and their disk to download doesn't even work. I was honestly disgusted with this hotel!!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2008-06-26T09:39:51-0400", "location_id": "240108", "id": "17256619", "user": {"username": "Monkey0521", "user_location": {"name": "NMB, South Carolina", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2007-05", "title": "Yuck!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60920-d240108-r7665914-m11068-Scottish_Inn-Macon_Georgia.html#review7665914", "text": "Was in town for the night because my husband had a show to perform at The Power Station across the street.  This was by far the worst place I have ever stayed.  I have stayed at other Scottish Inn's in the past and had no issues, but this place is awful. There were puke stains on the mattress and box spring, ceramic tile adhesive was splattered in the tub, tub walls and bathroom floor. There was only half a role of toilet paper and it wasn't even on the spool. There were stains on the towels.  The bathroom door (a hollow core door) was all chewed up and warped. It wouldn't even close. \nThere was no remote for the tv (The tv was nice.) 2 of the lamps in the room did not work (there no outlets to plug them into and one of the lamps was all wobbly.)\nSome of the other guests there appeared to be long time residents for they were hanging out, had their doors open and staring at the newcomers. Very disturbing. At least the locks on the doors were pretty strong.  \nA friend of ours stayed in the room next door and she said her room smelled of cat pee and that there were dirty socks in the trash can.\nAlso the vending machines and ice machine did not work.\nIt took the clerk a long time to get us checked in, too. He said he was new and in training, yet there was no one training him. He also said the Inn was undergoing renovations so please excuse the ugliness.  I bet if we were to come back to this place next year it will be in the same condition.   Yuck Yuck Yuck.\nGross, creepy place.\n", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2007-05-20T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "240108", "id": "7665914", "user": {"username": "MrsFishbone", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta, GA", "id": null}}}]}
