There's a ton of fun surprises (both large and little) in this room and this is a blast to do with friends. There's not as much of an emphasis on paper puzzles - the puzzles in this room are part of the decor and furniture, and work well with the overall theme.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-31T15:30:02-0400", "location_id": "10384205", "id": "413322810", "user": {"username": "William C", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Great puzzles and atmosphere", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d10384205-r377795272-m11068-Boxaroo-Boston_Massachusetts.html#review377795272", "text": "We loved this escape game! Production values were high. The puzzles were hard but fun and made sense with the theme (mystery of the magician's study). I've played many escape games and this one is better than 75% of them.\n\nThere was a good amount technology and gadgets but they weren't too gimmicky or intrusive. Everything worked just like magic!\n\nThe hint system was nice. There's no screen or intrusion to break the mood like in other games.\n\nOur gamemaster was kind enough to give us extra time as we were a team of only two people. There are several puzzles that can be worked on in parallel so I'd say 4 players would be ideal.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-29T21:38:22-0400", "location_id": "10384205", "id": "377795272", "user": {"username": "Johncormie", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
