Have always wanted to go here, but it opens at 4 PM and we generally leave Tucson to go home before the traffic starts.  This night was a stayover for a next day medical procedure so we hopped on the chance.\nAmple parking, not too busy and over the top friendly wait staff!\nThe first impression was \"this place is CLEAN!\"  We sat at the small bar where we could watch our dinners created.\nWe each had a salad, my Wife a Caprese and I a Butter Pecan.\nOne of these salads could've been a meal; MASSIVE!  We watched it being masterfully prepared.  No bagged commercial stuff here, all fresh and tastefully accented with dressing.  Our pizza order wasn't put in the oven until we were nearly completed with the salad which gave enough time to clear our plates.  \nThe Cura pizza was a circular masterpiece!  San Marzano tomato sauce base, soppresata, olives, whole garlic toes and cheese, artfully arranged and cooked to a T.  The crust was light and puffy and stood up well to the toppings.  Without the salads, I think we could've had our own pies, but the one satisfied our appetites perfectly.\nFor desert, we were drawn to the Panna Cotta.  Black raspberry panna cotta to be exact, served in a very nouveau and rustic way: in a jelly jar!  The panna acotta was pre-filled with the panna cotta and the raspberry preserves \"dolloped\" on top.  After staring at it for a few minutes we were instructed on how to eat it.  You fold it together, bringing the fruit down and the panna cotta up.  Delicioso!\nAri, the owner, is a very personable and friendly guy.  He had a smile on his face the entire time we we there and engaged in friendly conversation..  Nothing pretentious, just down to earth and very proud and passionate about his craft.\nNow we have to think of another excuse to stay over in Tucson so we can go back to Falora!!!

After dining at both Falora & PB, we came to the conclusion that it's difficult to compare the 2 because each are unique. Crusts at both places are wood-fired, but the premium toppings make them unique. Service was great. We arrived for an early dinner, so we didn't have to wait for a table (both indoor & outdoor patio seating available). The menu includes a list of around 10-12 pizzas, a few salads, & appetizers. We were starving, so we each ordered (& finished off) our own pizza. If you're not as hungry, you could easily share a pizza & also a salad/appetizer. I couldn't decide between the Pesto or Fumo (smoked salmon) pizzas, so I ordered the Pesto pizza & had the chef add smoked salmon...AMAZING!! My husband was very pleased with his Cura (salami) pizza. Our pizzas were done in prob less than 10 minutes! We paired our pizzas with wine & beer. The only suggestion I could give to the restaurant is to add maybe a bit more variety to the wine/beer list. Otherwise, everything was great, & we can't wait to return on a future trip to Tucson!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-05-28T11:38:41-0400", "location_id": "4789034", "id": "275356272", "user": {"username": "Taryn O", "user_location": {"name": "Tempe, Arizona, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Great surprise!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60950-d4789034-r271801388-m11068-Falora-Tucson_Arizona.html#review271801388", "text": "Our last night in Tucson on a college visit trip, we lucked in to finding Falora. What a treat! Superb pizza with premium ingredients (those two words don't do them justice), cooked to perfection, huge salads, nice wine . . . and the service was delightful. I'm not a communal table kind of person after schlepping all over looking at the campus, so having some privacy at dinner was important to me. Luckily, we were there early enough to get a small table. Now we know the best 4-top can be reserved . . . I hope our son chooses U of A so we can return often.
