Warm, welcoming diner-style ambiance with fun music memorabilia on the walls.  Raffi (the manager) has a smile and excellent service for every patron.\n\nThe menu offers a wonderful blend of breakfast classics - eggs, pancakes, home fries and breads, and some creative omelettes.  The omelettes are lovingly prepared, feature fresh ingredients, and nothing too oily.  The home fries are tasty without being greasy.  In fact, the entire menu is well-crafted and much less greasy than traditional diner preparations.  Good coffee - even the decaf.\n\nI've been back to the place several times since discovering it a few months ago, and brought many friends here, too.  Every one of them has thanked me for introducing them to this delightful breakfast/brunch spot. \n\nSpecial note:  A little hard to find because the sign is not on the awning or on top of the entrance.
