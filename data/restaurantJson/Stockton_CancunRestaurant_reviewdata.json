I will eat most anything lol and this food is not TERRIBLE. Its just nothing to rave about. Ita average. I always order chicken taco dinners no matter which mexican restaurant i go to. And here ...the decor is always great. A very large place. Always clean but i never really seen it packed or busy. Nice and quiet :) came here for a quick bite before working around 530pm. \nFood was brought out quick. Chicken taco dinner: Shells werent toasty or crisp but were a big soggy. Chicken was mostly thigh (i like all meats) but it tasted...like leftovers. Like reheated ...gamie? Lioe they boiled it with no spices. Rice was ok. Beans could use more flavors. Over all it was ok for the low price.
