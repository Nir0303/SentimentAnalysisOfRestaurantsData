They had a few interesting dishes there which I did try, they were a little too salty but not bad. There is a station for sea food where they serve crab legs, fresh mussels, clams for example. Another station for Asian cuisine which I looked at and thought it was very boring, just 4 types of dishes that to me did not look very appetizing and I love Asian food. The last station offers traditional American comfort food, ribs, meat loaf, mash potatoes, Roast Turkey, beef freshly sliced. Of course then there is the salad station with the generic stuff that most buffets have. I asked for some turkey and was given only ONE slice I had nothing else on my plate I was pretty disappointed. Even the sweet station really did not appeal to me, maybe I just wasnt in the mood. I did expect a little more really especially for the price at $26.99 per head which does include a soft drink. I didnt like the way that most people paid a tip upfront even before you sat down, I assume this is because you pay as you enter. The waitress was then taking the money out of the till and giving it to a member of staff which to me looked very dodgy. I would give this a miss next time I visit to me it really was not worth the money if your not into the seafood, which is really the wow factor for this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-14T17:25:28-0400", "location_id": "10844842", "id": "418651911", "user": {"username": "Maggie T", "user_location": {"name": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "id": "60927"}}}]}
