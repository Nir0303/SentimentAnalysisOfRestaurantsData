So we did just that.\n\nWe walked a short distance from the brewery to this pizza shop, located downtown.  There appears to be a public parking lot adjacent to this place, so that's handy.\n\nWe were getting our food to go, so we walked up to the ordering counter.  It's a little cramped and narrow there, and I'd image that when it's busy, that gets to be a bit of an annoyance.\n\nThe young lady who took our order was very patient as we decided.  There were three of us ordering different foods and she made sure to enter everything just as we wanted.  We appreciated how courteous she was.\n\nOne thing I didn't like is payment.  When ready to pay with my card, the ordering tablet was turned towards me and a big question about how much I wanted to tip was displayed.  I felt put on the spot and awkward.  I mean, the nice young lady was standing right there and I was to determine if I wanted to tip, even before the food came.  I didn't like that.  Besides, it was a to-go order.  No place should ever ask you to tip prior to getting your food, that's how I feel.  Don't get me wrong, I have no issues tipping when it's warranted...but this felt weird.  It's on a big tablet and displayed for anyone around to see.  Plus, they have a tip jar right beside the register!\n\nWhile waiting, we took in the cool decor of the pizza shop.  It's a long narrow building with some large photos of Springfield \"back in the day.\"  The building has a very industrial look with some charm mixed in.  \n\nThe long bar seating area surrounding the kitchen has such a cool look to it.  Very unique.  \n\nThere appeared to be an outdoor seating area out back, but we did not go out there.\n\nThis place serves beer, which is fantastic.  \n\nThe menu is huge.  If you're here for a pizza, beware, choices are ample.  They feature tons of specialty pizzas which sounded fantastic.  Or, simply create your own.  Plus, there were other Italian favorites, subs, salads, etc.  Prices were reasonable.\n\nTwo of us ordered calzones and I ordered a sub.  I cannot have dairy, so my options were a little limited (yes, I know it's a pizza place), but I did have a nice choice of subs.  I had the barbecue chicken sub which was cubed grilled chicken smothered in BBQ sauce with lettuce.  The sub roll tasted very fresh (possibly baked there) and was toasted perfectly.\n\nThe others with their calzones seemed to enjoy.  They looked good, not burnt and filled with plenty of goodies.\n\nFood was made in adequate time and cooked well.  It wasn't exceptional, but certainly nothing wrong with it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-16T14:47:03-0400", "location_id": "3475009", "id": "428549956", "user": {"username": "Willow L", "user_location": {"name": "PA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Great Food - Nice kids!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51000-d3475009-r428304742-m11068-Bada_Bing_Pizzeria-Springfield_Ohio.html#review428304742", "text": "Get the Goombah - seriously, Joey \"Bag of Donuts\" and Little Nicky  Blue Shoes wouldn't lie to you.

And although they did not deliver the grinder we ordered as asked, they were quick to correct their mistake when it was brought to their attention, and it earned rave reviews from my dad. The individual gourmet pizza I ordered was light and tasty, with a crispy outer crust that had a soft, fresh center and was not overcooked.  The larger cheese pizza was not quite as good, with too much cheese making it heavy and a bit soggy. But on balance, this was good option for casual dining and I would definitely recommend it, as there are very few other downtown options.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-27T16:00:20-0400", "location_id": "3475009", "id": "386726951", "user": {"username": "Lynda B", "user_location": {"name": "Winchester, Virginia", "id": "58318"}}}]}
