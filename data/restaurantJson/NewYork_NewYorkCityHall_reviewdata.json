Finished in 1811, it is one of the oldest buildings in the City.  You may never see another staircase so beautiful and unique, the curving steps of which circle up and around in an arc, ascending and descending onto the ground floor with no supports.  The stones of the marble steps press against each other with a wide flat stone at its top (a true keystone) which holds the whole in place.  For four days when Abraham Lincoln's body lay in state on the large flat topstone, there was a steady stream of persons viewing his body, and many feared the staircase would collapse.  The building's architect was John McComb;  and I know of only one other work by him---the beautiful, white-columned, red-brick house on State Street near the Battery which now houses the shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann  Seton.  In 1811, it was thought that the back of City Hall would seldom be seen because it was, at that time, so far north of the City; finally, in 1954, the bricks on its back (North) side were replaced by beautiful marble slabs matching those of the rest of the building and quarried from the same quarry in Vermont that was used originally.  On the second floor is a painting of Lafayette, the first ambassador from France to the United States following the French Revolution; it was painted by the man who invented the the Morse Code and is considered by some to be his masterpiece.  At a time when photography did not exist, Morse might have been considered one of the \"official\" painters of important persons in the United States, a kind of parallel, if you will, of the court painters in the old countries in Europe; the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art has another great work by Morse.\n-----The keepers of the City Hall are wary of visitors (with good reason), but if you ask they will almost surely permit you to see the grand staircase and the Morse painting and the old horsehair sofa and chairs which were used by Governor Clinton more than a hundred years ago.\n-----Nearby City Hall is the white terra cotta Woolworth Building of 1913; built by Cass Gilbert in his signature Moorish-and-Gothic style, it remained the world's tallest building until 1929.  Also nearby is the Brooklyn Bridge of 1883.\n-----When I do walking tours of historic Brooklyn Heights, I include by the Woolworth Building and City Hall and the buildings of Newspaper Row.\nSubmitted by Joseph London, Licensed New York City Tour Guide and New York Historian", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-04-20T15:35:04-0400", "location_id": "10031098", "id": "365855603", "user": {"username": "JOSEPH L", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "It's where it all began", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d10031098-r359156057-m11068-New_York_City_Hall-New_York_City_New_York.html#review359156057", "text": "It's hard to imagine this is where most of the decisions are made for what is such a big city but so we were told it is!
