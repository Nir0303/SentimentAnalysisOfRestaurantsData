We walked in and it was half empty. We assumed we would be given a table in the dining area but instead the hostess offered a high-top in the bar, which we declined, so apparently, without asking she decided we'd like a booth in the bar. She asked us to wait, even though half the dining area was empty, for her to clean off a booth in the bar. This took her at least 5 minutes. When she managed to get that done and seat us, the table was still wet with stinky water. I wiped it down with the one napkin that was provided for what was clearly a party of two. For whatever reason we were still willing to give it a shot because we had so many good times there over the years. But when my wife's menu stuck to the table, and my menu had pages inside stuck together from filth, we got up and walked away. We are so disappointed.

Not a good start.\nServer then tells us to 'grab a table' and he'll be right over with menus (looking around there was only 1 large group at a table just off the entrance, lots of people around the bar area). Manager brings us the menus and tells us the server will be right with us, he shows up approximately 4 minutes later.\nAfter taking our drink order, and bringing them to us, I enquire if there are any specials, this being a Friday night after 9 pm we expected there to be as in the past.\nApparently they changed their menu to not include Friday or Saturday in any specials/promotional pricing (in the past they had half price appetizers and the place was always packed). Not sure if this is such a good business decision as the only people in the place, besides us, were sitting at the bar drinking, not eating.\nThis didn't deter us as we ordered anyway.\nWe each had a flatbread pizza, hers being a margarita (with pasta sauce) and mine pepperoni. They were good, just not great. Server did ask how everything was as he noticed that my fianc\u00e9 didn't eat much of her pizza, we told him, all we got was a 'sorry'.

I had the Honey Wrap and substituted a tortilla soup for the fries.  Sandwich was good, and the soup was a bit spicy but still good.  There also was a mix-up on my order and I also received fries.  Oh, well!  My wife had the Bonfire Club sandwich with fries.  Food was a little slower in coming out, according to my daughter but was not excessively long.
