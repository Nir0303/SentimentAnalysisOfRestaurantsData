Was supposed to be delivered at 4:00 pm but arrived at 2:15. The delivery guy didn't speak enough English (any) to talk about the early delivery. The food was something made in a factory and probably reheated from a pouch. Everything was awful and nothing fresh. The beef seem to be some kind processed spam like beef. Essentially tasteless but very uniformly cut strips, flat on both sides. I mean I nearly gagged.
