The former manager, Steve, and his staff were wonderful. We saw them so often that they knew all of us by name, and knew our buffet favorites as well. The food was great, and the service exceptional.\nIt is not the case any more. Steve and his staff are no longer there and the people that have replaced them are seemingly doing their best to lose China Garden all their business!!!\nI took my son there yesterday for his birthday, 7/22. What a disaster!!!We arrived just at the beginning of dinner service, 5pm. Everything was empty on the buffet. We attempted to take a seat and were told to stop by a surly young waitress. She then escorted us through the empty restaurant to a tiny table in sight of the bathrooms - which are filthy and broken - and the kitchen. No welcome..not a smile...nothing. I wanted to move to the actual restaurant but did not because I assumed it was booked. It was not - she seated other guests in there during the short time we were there. The buffet was not maintained so we only ate a little, the surly young waitress did not bother to fill up my sons drink, or ask if we needed anything and then walked up to our table and tried to remove the plates we had in front of us while we still had the utensils in our hands!!!! We didn't even get to finish our meals!Walked up to pay and had to wait 5 minutes while the rude young waitress was talking to someone in the kitchen. When she came back and sullenly received my payment she didn't smile or say \"thank you.\"\nWorking at a the Front Desk here in Olde Towne I usually have about 30 or 40 hotel guests per day ask me about a good place to eat. For the past few months when I have been referring them to China Garden the ones that go come back with the same type of complaints...the buffet isn't properly maintained, or the restaurant closes early hurrying the paying buffet guests out. You can be sure from this time on that no one in my family will ever return, nor will I ever reccomend it to a guest. There is actually a very good Chinese restaurant just a few blocks away called China Ocean - and they will get all of our referrals from this point on. Their food is good, and they are friendly and welcoming, unlike this new staff at China Garden that seem to be intent on driving all the regular customers away.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-07-23T15:22:02-0400", "location_id": "418748", "id": "168779421", "user": {"username": "Sindy D", "user_location": {"name": "Portsmouth, Virginia", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2011-11", "title": "Avoid the buffet.
