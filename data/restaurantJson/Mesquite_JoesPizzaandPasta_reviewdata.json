I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before eating our meal.  upon walking in the restroom, the smell almost knocked me down. I don't know whether there was a dead rat or ruined chicken that was contributing to the smell, but it was absolutely horrible; the smell is similar.  that was the start of the bad experience.  we got our meal and the dish tasted really bad, almost like ruined chicken, so we were unable to eat the meal.  the waitress asked us if everything was wonderful and I had to tell her, my husband and I weren't please with the meal.  we only ate a couple of bites each and decided we couldn't stomach any more.  I told her we knew it wasn't her fault.  she did not get the owner/manager to come speak with us and acted offended that we had the nerve to complain.  we couldn't believe they didn't want to please their customer by at least offering to let us have another dish or give a discount.  needless to say, we won't be going back and we won't visit the sister location on Galloway ever again either.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-15T07:56:07-0500", "location_id": "1239190", "id": "437524042", "user": {"username": "sanityplease", "user_location": {"name": "dallas", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Great italian at a great price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56280-d1239190-r415713757-m11068-Joe_s_Pizza_and_Pasta-Mesquite_Texas.html#review415713757", "text": "We love this italian restaurant.
