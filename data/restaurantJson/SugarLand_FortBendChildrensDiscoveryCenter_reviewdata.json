My six year old granddaughter enjoyed the two hours we were there. However, many of the exhibits required more participation and explanation (of how to do them) from me than I expected. In other words, most of the exhibits seemed geared towards older elementary age children rather than to younger or pre-school age children, who can't read. I also think the price is a bit high, making it more of a once or twice a year excursion, rather than a more frequent one. I love that the \"town\" was created using local stores and businesses.

In my opinion this is Sugar Land proper and has gotten the short end of the stick so far.\n\nA few years down the road, I will probably eat my words, or even want to move away. The development is sweet and scary at the same time.\n\nBeing a nearby resident, I am keeping my fingers crossed that the development of the area will continue to provide this type of family oriented venue.\n\nWe do not, I repeat do not need an alcohol serving movie theater at this location. Thank you. Drink your drinks in your own backyard.\n\nOkay, back to the museum itself. It is the perfect size. For now you can park in a nice sized existing lot right in front of the old silos. \n\nThis place is a true blessing as the heat of summer creeps in. \n\nIt is your typical Children's museum with a series of venues inside for the kiddies.\n\nThe currect exhibits are:    Cyberchase \u2013 The Chase is On!, Dragons & Fairies, How Does It Work?, Kidtropolis, Tot*Spot.\n\nWe visited with two very excited little brothers. One was aged 3 and a half, the other 1 and a half.\n\nThe pricing is $12 for everyone, kids included. Only children under one are free. I feel they could have been a little more relaxed on kid pricing, but oh well.\n\nSeniors are $11 (not sure of the age).\n\nThe kids were thrilled by it all. Plenty of fun things to keep them occupied. \n\nWe had a fourteen year old with us as well and she was not bored.\n\nI splurged and went for the $175 membership which will get us in for free for a year. This extends to 8 people and you just have to list three adults on a form. They then asked that one of those three adults be in the group if you bring in friends, etc.\n\nThey have lesser memberships. I think everyone should show support and become a member!!!!!\n\nWe need this place. Remember when they had the satellite place in town center years ago? Well this is the result.\n\nI could not be happier. Thank you to the George Foundation of Richmond for providing funding. Along with all the others who donated to make this place possible.\n\nI hope it brings lots of joy to the community for years to come.\n\nSigned,\n\nVery Happy Grandma", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "CMHouston80, Public Relations Manager at Fort Bend Children&#39;s Discovery Center, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for taking the time to review our all-new Fort Bend Children's Discovery Center.
