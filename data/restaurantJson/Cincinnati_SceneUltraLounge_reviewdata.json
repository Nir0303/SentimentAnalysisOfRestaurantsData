Located next door to the Righteous Room which was our go to happy hour when I'm town but not anymore. Half price on all drinks, including the $11 bourbon I like. A bunch of $4.95 to $5.95 appetizers as well which was good food and served fast. The thing I really like was no attitude by bartender or workers and it's much wider than all the shotgun style bars so you don't feel so packed in. Will return soon I'm sure.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-05T04:02:47-0400", "location_id": "5572402", "id": "414882555", "user": {"username": "Banny9949", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Nice olace", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60993-d5572402-r315596055-m11068-Scene_Ultra_Lounge-Cincinnati_Ohio.html#review315596055", "text": "Good atmosphere, the bartender was very friendly, real nice place, went a few times with a few relatives and friends, we enjoyed it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-02T07:04:05-0400", "location_id": "5572402", "id": "315596055", "user": {"username": "jxm26", "user_location": {"name": "South Point, Ohio", "id": "50988"}}}]}
