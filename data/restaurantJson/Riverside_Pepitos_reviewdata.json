Our orders were promptly taken, but we had quite a wait for the server to bring us our food.  The bigger problem, however, is that our food was not hot (and therefore must have been sitting on the counter too long while our server was busy cleaning up after a large party).  And....  I also need to add....  what happened to Pepito's rice recipe?  That once delicious flavor is gone. \n\nYes, things have definitely changed in our once go-to Mexican restaurant.  Too bad.
