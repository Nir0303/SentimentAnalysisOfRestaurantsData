Although the noise level in the Bar area was stentorian, the booth where we dined was isolated, quiet and pleasant. The food was surprising good and reminded me of Garibaldi's when it was at its peak. The server was attentive and very responsive. It was a delightful experience.

We each got a different salad and everyone raved over theirs!  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  Parking was a piece of cake with large lot right next door.
