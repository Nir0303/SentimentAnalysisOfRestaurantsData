Its tucked away on a side street (ClintonSt) which runs parallel to Main St on library hill. We ended up there because our original plan for St Patricks Day didnt work out at a nearby eatery. We both had corned beef and cabbage which was excellent but what really makes us want to go back was some of the other dishes we saw coming out, but mostly because of our server (they all seemed very friendly and on the same team). after realizing it was our firdt time here,she proudly told us about the chef, the building (very historical - built in 1933), the owner and all of their specials. She really believed in this place - which is huge!!! The Sesame grilled Tuna that went to the table next to us looked awesome and will be my choice for our follow-up visit. The special we plan on taking advantage of is their Tuesday buy one entree and get one free deal. This special is typically seen at the chain restaurants and not at a small eatery with well thought out menu items that are already at a reasonable price. This place definitely deserves a try.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-23T08:13:37-0400", "location_id": "588498", "id": "261271371", "user": {"username": "Brian L", "user_location": {"name": "Nashua, New Hampshire", "id": "46172"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Gone downhill fast", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46172-d588498-r253055318-m11068-Fodys_Great_American_Tavern-Nashua_New_Hampshire.html#review253055318", "text": "I used to frequent here with all my friends, but now we avoid it like the plague.
