Be careful, if you are a light eater, one will feed two!  They're that big.  There can be a line (that is how good they are), but they are quick to make them up, cook, and serve to you within a few minutes of ordering.  When they run out of ingredients, they're done, so I would get there by 9:00 a.m.  Really the best breakfast burrito I've eaten.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-05-17T11:07:16-0400", "location_id": "2627549", "id": "272580725", "user": {"username": "ELS20", "user_location": {"name": "Dubuque", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Best Burritos you can find.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37853-d2627549-r270147489-m11068-Adobos_Mexican_Grill-Dubuque_Iowa.html#review270147489", "text": "The best way to describe Adobos is by comparing it to Chipotle or Pancheros. It is a burrito bar style restaurant, but much better than any chain place you have ever been to. All of the ingredients are fresh, with marinated chicken, beef or two kinds of pork. There are more options than the chain restaurants, and the burritos are much bigger! \n\nThe restaurant also offers, tacos, salads, burrito bowls, etc, with a good range of drink options as well (including alcohol). \n\nI highly recommend this place for an affordable, filling and delicious meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-05-05T06:20:15-0400", "location_id": "2627549", "id": "270147489", "user": {"username": "Austin W", "user_location": {"name": "Dubuque, Iowa", "id": "37853"}}}]}
