What a GREAT little cafe!  The sandwiches are made with delicious bread. But the sandwiches are more ingredients than bread - just the opposite of most places. Everything is fresh. The salads are wonderful. And of course they make all kinds of great juices. \nPlease note: I don't like fast food chain restaurants because the food is poor quality, tasteless, greasy, etc.  \nBut we loved the Downtown Juice Factory because it is a lunch I can actually enjoy.
