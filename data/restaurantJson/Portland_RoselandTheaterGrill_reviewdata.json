No need for binoculars EVER you can see everything which is usually just a blur at some big stadium.\n\nJust some of the names I have seen there over the years.  Rob Zombie, Joe Satriani. Blue Oyster Cult, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Godsmack, George Thorogood, Foghat and more !\n\nI will address the other reviews regarding security.  Yes they are surley, rude and generally unhelpful until you really need them. The last show I was at the mosh pit was forming just behind the first rows of people standing. There was a guy just randomly slamming into people which is pretty normal until until he started picking on the women.  people started pushing him towards the back and the idiot threw a punch.  He missed because he was drunk and next thing you know security had this guy well secured and on his way out which drew cheers from the people in the front.  So go ahead and complain just as I have in the past about their rudeness but we had more fun because security was there.  Just ignore their attitude when you enter and all will be fine.    Oh yeah.  If you have not graduated mosh pit 101 stay on the balcony or well in back on the stage level.  Or dive in and have some wild fun !

Be prepared to potentially be ejected for so much as an aspirin in your purse. The little security girl told me I needed a prescription for some generic naproxen that she kept calling something I'd never heard of. When I argued, she tried to eject me from the premises for quote 'disrespecting her'. Fortunately, her more level headed partner let me through. Be prepared to wait in a very slow beer line and to be sequestered to a dank dirty basement bar. You cannot take your drinks into the show. Be prepared to potentially have your view blocked by floor to ceiling support poles. The sound quality is so-so. I will not return to this theater unless they resurrect Jimis' ghost and I'm pretty sure that'll never happen and if it did, he would never sign on to play the Roseland.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-04-04T11:17:53-0400", "location_id": "605208", "id": "156618102", "user": {"username": "Dewbaum", "user_location": {"name": "Portland, Oregon", "id": "52024"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2013-03", "title": "\"Peter's Room\" theater is poor", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d605208-r155523188-m11068-Roseland_Theater_Grill-Portland_Oregon.html#review155523188", "text": "I attended a show in the downstairs theater (\"Peter's Room\") of the Roseland Theater last night.  Although the bands were fine, the theater was a poor experience.  First, I saw that the website said that \"There is also a first class restaurant and bar in Peter\u2019s Room\", so I planned to have dinner there.  When I got there I found they were only serving snacks (e.g. nachos, tater tots, etc.) and pizza.\n\nIn the theater, there was only seating for about 35, though the room had capacity for more if they'd wanted to put out chairs.  The room is essentially divided into quarters.  The stage only takes up half the width of the room (in front of the house-right side).  That's a little weird, but visibility from the front house-left side seems fine if a little angled.  It gets weirder in the back half.  The bar takes up the house-right quarter giving the bartender but no one else a great view of the stage.  The seating back there is on the house-left side, leaving the audience there to look diagonally across the room to the stage through a collection of pillars.  If they'd only swapped the bar and the seating back there (or put the stage in the middle or on the house-left side), it would have been much better for the audience.\n\nOverall, this feels like a barely-making-it theater that can't afford to do much for the customers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-03-24T10:35:13-0400", "location_id": "605208", "id": "155523188", "user": {"username": "Brian234", "user_location": {"name": "Portland, Oregon", "id": "52024"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-12", "title": "MAA Fight", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52024-d605208-r147811846-m11068-Roseland_Theater_Grill-Portland_Oregon.html#review147811846", "text": "Ive been to the Roseland twice for Rumble at the Roseland.
