We liked the atmosphere, and our server was very good. The food was mixed.\n\nWe each started with a glass of the house Pinot Noir, Block 9.   We eventually ordered a third glass of wine to split as we finished our meal.\n\nThe wine was good and I give La Stalla a big thumbs up for having sparkling clean wine glasses.  I can't stand glasses that  have water spots and streaks, or worse yet remnants of another diner's lipstick.  And so many \"nice\" restaurants don't go the extra mile to wipe down their glasses to ensure a sparkling glass.\n\nThe meal started out with some warm, crusty and delicious Tuscan bread.  Bread was accompanied by a serving of grated Parmesan and a side of Balsamic vinaigrette.   Olive oil is on every table.  Bread was yummy!\n\nHubby had the Caesar salad and especially liked the dressing, very light and not creamy.  I had the pear and Gorgonzola salad and was surprised to see that the pear was from a can.  The salad was very tasty, with plenty of cheese and nuts, but the canned pear was a disappointment.\n\nI had the dinner special of Osso Bucco which was delicious and fall off the bone tender.  It was served on fettuccine which was nothing special.\n\nHubby had the pasta with broccoli and sweet Italian sausage in a creamy garlic sauce.   The sausage was not served the way we expected it.  Usually we'd see sausage cut in bite size pieces or even larger chunks to be cut by diner. This sausage was in tiny little balls.  Still tasty but unexpected and not terribly visually appealing.\n\nWith the 3 glasses of wine, 2 salads, and 2 entrees our check came to $102.00 - before tip.

The bread has a nice hard crust and the vegetables were al dente.  My chicken was good but I felt that in May have been partially cooked before finishing.  My husband was pleased with his choice.  We didn't order it but the pizza looked terrific.  Prices are reasonable ( $18. For mine and $ 25. for my husbands.  Why a 4 rating ?

I will say that it was more like 4.75, but why be picky..\n\nFood - we had calamari,  mussels, and bruschetta.  The calamari was perfect..soft, not crispy, large. It was delcious. The mussels were good.basic, but good. The bruschetta was baked and topped with mushrooms. DELICIOUS! For dinner I had veal saltimbocca which was fantastic. My wife had spaghetti carbonara which was perfect. For dessert, creme Brule and Gelato. \n\nService - top notch.  She knew her wines, had a great personality, and was efficient. That's why we tipped 40%.\n\nAtmosphere- very intimate. There was three large parties but it was still cozy.\n\nGreat place. \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-08T02:08:53-0500", "location_id": "638255", "id": "353786609", "user": {"username": "22food22", "user_location": {"name": "Phoenix, Arizona", "id": "31310"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Debated a 3 or 4 Rating - Read why I went with a 3", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31190-d638255-r351592889-m11068-La_Stalla_Cucina_Rustica-Chandler_Arizona.html#review351592889", "text": "I guess I would give this restaurant a 3+. It was good, but I found it did not meet my expectations after reading many very good reviews. I would say that my reservations are based on personal preferences, so don't be turned off.\n\nThe atmosphere is attractive and clean. However, the straight-backed wood chairs are not comfortable for any length of time.\n\nWe ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer. The calamari was cooked perfectly, but we would have enjoyed it more if the coating had been crispy. The serving was more than large enough for 2 people. I think 4 could share it.\n\nI splurged on Spaghetti Carbonara. It was tasty, but (again a personal preference) the proscuitto should have had more of the fat rendered out of it. The pieces were generous, but I didn't eat most of them because they were unpleasantly chewy.\n\nMy husband had the Sweet Potato Ravioli in Gorgonzola Sauce. Very, very, rich. The ravioli filling seemes a little overly sweet. The gorgonzola sauce was good, but perhaps overloaded with butter.\n\nService was young, casual, and friendly - in a good way.\n\nWe wouldn't go out of our way to dine here again, but we might try again (selecting different menu items).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-28T07:24:22-0500", "location_id": "638255", "id": "351592889", "user": {"username": "RunawayBoomer", "user_location": {"name": "Prescott, Arizona", "id": "31323"}}}]}
