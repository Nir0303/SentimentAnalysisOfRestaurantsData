The cold noodles (appetizer) were not the typical American slop of a cold peanut butter sauce on noodles, but two varieties of noodles in a highly-complex seasoned dish with many layers. (I recommend taking this dish home as take out, as its sauce is a little messy for inhouse eating). For lunch, try the chinese eggplant with basil, a multi-flavor simple recipe and get their house rice with egg for an extra $1 in the lunch menu. If you have only ever tried American Szechaun and want to judge this place by that, don't go. But if a complex, unique kitchen of flavors and an adventure for the taste buds are your game, try this place out. It is clear the change-over of restaurants here is affected how it is viewed.

The food is excellent. The decor is not anything great; I miss Peking Cuisine's tablecloths for dinner and slightly more subdued lighting. But the staff is very friendly and we have enjoyed every dish: dumplings, fish, tofu, and chow fun.

It came loaded with cilantro. Same with the dumplings whose sauce also had cilantro.\n\nThe chicken with broccoli was very tasty and less greasy than a lot of other Chinese places. The wonton soup & dumplings were also good, though my wife couldn't eat them because of the cilantro.\n\nI look forward to trying more dishes at Dumpling House - hope they can work out the ingredient communication glitches.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-18T08:02:34-0500", "location_id": "9750076", "id": "340980268", "user": {"username": "WhosTheBOS", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}]}
