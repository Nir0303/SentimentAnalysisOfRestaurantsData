You park in the back and walk in to a very large indoor seating area. There's also tons of picnic tables outside in case you are a really messy eater! The inside is decorated with a full size tractor and some other cool farm stuff. \nThe way this place works is you get in a line to order. Along the way you pick up your own tray, cutlery, drinks, and flatware. You eventually (doesn't take too long, even on a Friday night!) get to the cafeteria-type counter where you slide your tray along the counter in front of the restaurant staff who dish up your meals. If you are ordering more than one dinner you should think about keeping your family in line with you to help carry the trays, they can be heavy!\nThere are paper menus available and the whole menu is also on the wall or somewhere we easily saw it. At the end of the counter you pay the lady, and then go to your table. Trust me, even on a super busy Friday night we were easily able to seat all 12 of our party. \nThey also have friendly staff circulating in the dining room to see if you need anything or to take away empty trays or plates. They also assist you in the beginning if you can't figure out the line or the way to order properly. Very helpful, very friendly, and make you feel like family. This makes sense because it is a family run business, and it shows.\n\nNow the food: nothing was less than EXCELLENT. The brisket was extra special and so was the pulled pork. You cannot go wrong with anything here. They have a big smoker out back and put it to good use. We have some pretty solid BBQ joints in Southern California but I'd put this one up against any of them and I'm pretty sure Joe's would win!\n\nBottom line: GO. Check it out. Be ready to take a lot home due to portion size. Save room for dessert....okay, that will never happen. But you could take some dessert home anyway. OR eat it first??? \n\nProTip: Outside on their lawn is a great place for the kids to run around after dinner while the adults are sitting around nearby fighting off their food coma's. :D  Enjoy!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-17T17:04:22-0400", "location_id": "332616", "id": "428963540", "user": {"username": "fyremaven", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "It's ok ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31230-d332616-r428876961-m11068-Joe_s_Real_BBQ-Gilbert_Arizona.html#review428876961", "text": "I used to love this place but now think it's just average.

Long before the current, new hip places popped up across from Joe's, this place has been serving locals a wonderful selection of BBQ meats and sides for many years.  I personally love the huge russet potatoes, salads and the old fashioned root beer.  The place has a charming western, farm decor with indoor and outdoor seating.  Great food and ambience!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-09-13T13:19:44-0400", "location_id": "332616", "id": "418208954", "user": {"username": "TCAGJ", "user_location": {"name": "Gilbert, Arizona", "id": "31230"}}}]}
