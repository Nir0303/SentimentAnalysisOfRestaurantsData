She remembered me and, without my asking, seated me in the table I like.  That is a touch I appreciate.\n\nI seem to be stuck on the pistachio encrusted salmon with rice and asparagus.  This is an excellent bargain for $14.  The salmon is a large, beautifully prepared piece and the rice and asparagus are savory from the sweet pistachio crust on the salmon.  Yummy and I eat every bite.\n\nThe key lime pie is sweet and tart and is an authentic version of this Florida classic.  My only quibble is that they do not use real whipped cream, which is a must with such good pie.\n\nThey have a nice selection of wines by the glass as well.\n\nAll in all, a most pleasant way to spend some time for lunch.  I know this place gets mobbed for dinner, especially during season.  So go for lunch, skip the crowds and enjoy some delicious seafood.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-11-01T11:32:13-0400", "location_id": "4104542", "id": "433709234", "user": {"username": "maria a", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Awesome", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34118-d4104542-r433672039-m11068-Fish_Tale_Grill_by_Merrick_Seafood-Cape_Coral_Florida.html#review433672039", "text": "Great dinner and service.

It was a new place for two of us and the third had been there a couple years ago. Since service in a restaurant is very important I'll start with that - it was excellent. Our waitress was was very personable and attentive. We each ordered a different dish - one had the seafood platter, another had the bourbon salmon and I had the grouper picatta. Since we first 'eat with our eyes' I must say the presentation of each dish was beautiful. After taking one taste we forgot the presentation and just enjoyed the wonderful flavors. The person who'd been there before was very impressed and said the food was better than she'd had a couple years ago so they must have a new cheff.
