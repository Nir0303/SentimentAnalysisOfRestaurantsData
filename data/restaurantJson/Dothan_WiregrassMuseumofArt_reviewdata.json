It was amazing, and I can't say enough about it!\n\nFirst of all, her artwork is just amazing. Realistic art is my favorite, so it was a hit with me. I have no words to describe it... if you are reading this post and can get to the museum before 9/26/15, when the exhibit closes, then do so!\n\nThe Art After Hours event was only $5 to get in to. They served wine and beer and other refreshments and you could walk around (most parts of the museum) with your beverage and take in the art.\n\nEveryone at the museum was super nice, none more so than the awesome security guard they had on staff posted outside one of the art exhibit rooms. I know it's probably odd to mention the security guard, but I'm telling you, he was the nicest guy and he helped add to our positive experience. (Although it was a repeat visit for me to the museum, it was my fiance's first time here. He said it was his first time at an art museum, EVER? The verdict is...he LOVED it! <and not just because he could have beer this night!>)\n\nAnyway, an enjoyable place for all, whether it's an \"Art After Hours\" or just a regular day at the museum.
