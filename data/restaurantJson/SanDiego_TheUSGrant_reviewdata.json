It was quite a hike to the elevator but that was not an issue.  Unfortunately that evening after attending a concert across the plaza from the hotel our room key would not unlock the door.  We went downstairs and security came up with us.  Their key also didn't work.  Security called someone from maintenance who determined that we needed a new battery.  We stood around for about a half an hour before it was determined by the two men trying to fix the problem that it would take about an hour and the door couldn't be fixed that evening.  So we couldn't leave our room that night and would have to check out with all our belongings in the morning since the room couldn't be sused to come and go.  We asked for and got a complimentary breakfast in the restaurant downstairs.  We were a bit dismayed to find out that there was no notation on our account at check out that we'd had the trouble with the lock on our door and the inconvenience of having workmen there for approximately a half an hour of futile attempts to fix it.\nIn the end it did not ruin our stay but the communication between security and the front desk didn't seem to be 100%.  The breakfast we had (comped in the end) was delicious and the service couldn't have been better.  The atmosphere was very elegant, our waiter's and bus staff were attentive and friendly.

The room is large and features a sitting area with an L-Shaped couch and coffee table.  There is also a work desk and another TV in the area where the bed is located.  The room also features a refrigerator (unstacked, which I prefer), coffee maker and safe.  The furnishings were new, and stylish(in my opinion).  Also, the bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom isn't very large and it is updated with a single vanity and shower only.  It easily got the job done for my solo stay but I could see it being a little tight if there was a couple staying in the room.  Overall, I would absolutely stay in this room again.  The entertaining area was perfect and utilized several times during my stay.\n\nI dined at the Grant Grill on Thursday evening and received superior service while eating at the bar.  The food and drinks were both good and there was a live jazz trio adding to the atmosphere.  I also had breakfast once at the Grant Grill during my stay and it was excellent, as well.  The service was excellent for both meals.\n\nThe location is solid, easily within walking distance of retail, dining and the public transit system.  I would say it is in a fairly active part of town but not overly so that it was inconvenient as a guest.\n\nI would definitely stay at the US Grant again and I would say that while the room was very good, the service was what stood out to me during the trip...which is what helps set a luxury brand apart for others.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-08T13:21:54-0500", "location_id": "80668", "id": "435702661", "user": {"username": "LeBeauBG", "user_location": {"name": "Cincinnati, OH", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "My favorite hotel in San Diego ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d80668-r435226822-m11068-The_US_Grant-San_Diego_California.html#review435226822", "text": "I stay at the US Grant every chance I get.

The staff were all really amazing and helpful - so I don't want to miss giving them praise.  We had a deluxe room that was large but had little furniture and what was there wasn't inviting.  The bathroom as very large but again - there was nothing in it but the vanity with the sink so it felt like it had been robbed of something - just lots of floor space.  The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, the was not place to hang towels besides one hook that had the bathrobes on it. The bathroom fixtures were just average - not cool looking or special.  \n\nThe bed was very comfortable and the sheets/pillows were great.  The towels were thick and new.  The bath products were nice.\n\nThe main lobby feels the same - empty and cold and not inviting.  I feel like they a redo on the cheap and needed to take it to the next level to get that \"luxury\" feel.
