The decor features lots of colorful painted chairs with the restaurant's name.  There are booths and tables available and you can order Spanish food and/or pizza.  This would be good for a family with picky eaters.\n\nMy wife and I usually get the goat meat burrito.  This is a very large burrito that is very tasty and less than $6.  You will not be able to pick it up to eat, a knife and fork are required.  They also give you tortilla chips with salsa.  The salsa is hot and spicy but you can request other salsas as well.  They also have specialty drinks that are tasty.\n\nParking (which could be a problem in New Brunswick) is adequate as this restaurant has a parking lot adjacent to it that is shared with a laundromat and other business.\n\nSometimes a person will come by with items to sell.

Took our order and brought stale tortilla chips and some salsa with a hair in it.... I wish down one in my group would have said, let's bail on this now... No one did so I figured we wee goon g to give it a shot. Bad move. Food was dry disgusting and tasteless... I had chicken fajita, the chicken was like wood. Seriously like wood. The vegetables were awful and bland..my son had something that's had shrimp, wings and a flouta that was fried beyond being edible.  \n\nI looked around and realized the people were all from the country of the restaurant, which is fine, but the whole place and people looked dirty. \n\nGo someplace else.
