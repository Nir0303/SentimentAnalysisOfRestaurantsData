Walked in and asked about the rooms and if available. The manager looked up at me with a scowl on his face like I was seriously disturbing him and the look of disapproval. No welcome, no how may help you, I know this look so I did not take it on I just wanted a place to sleep for a few hours because I anticipated I would be out for most of the time.  He sent me to look at a room but there were people in it, he even gave me the key. Luckily the guests were leaving and the door was open so I got a glimpse, I paid for a room and left. When I returned later and opened the door the room kicked with such a stench, I put the AC on to cool things down a little, there was a damp spot on the floor between the bed and the fridge. Every time I walk by my foot would stick to the carpet. I opened the bedside draw to put some items in it I was greeted with a box of open condoms and wrappe! The AC blows directly on the bed with no adjustment so at some time in the night it became very uncomfortable, I took the chair and put my suitcase on it in front of the vent to redirect the airflow. The man upstairs had to be doing P90X because I could hear him; every step he took was so noisy. My left arm started to itch the first night and after the second night a rash broke , that was it, I seriously know how to rough it, I am a scuba instructor and have been in some places before. I can take a beating but this was totally ridiculous to pay for it, I stayed two nights and that was it, and he still charged for 3 ontop of that. When it was time to do a refund he charged the card instead of reversing it, leaving me with $1000.00 US less on my card because it would take 10 days for  the charges  reverse.\n\nAll in all don't stay here!!!! There are many other options in Torrance which I found just by driving around, I would highly recommend Travelodge on Sepulveda Blvd. and higher up from Cali Inn there is Econolodge if you have to stay in the area.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-06-23T05:39:45-0400", "location_id": "1529502", "id": "164890144", "user": {"username": "beentheret2", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2013-02", "title": "DO NOT STAY HERE!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32177-d1529502-r152285376-m11068-Cali_Inn-Carson_California.html#review152285376", "text": "This place was terrible. As soon as I walked into my room, I could hear the people on either side of me talking and their TVs. The walls were so painfully thin that I knew I would not be able to sleep that night. I requested a different room from the manager. He told me they only had larger rooms available and that I had to pay an additional fee to switch to one of those rooms. After some push back from me, he asked if I wanted a refund and I said yes. Any hotel manager that is willing to refund my money rather than simply switch my room is crazy in my opinion, but I'm glad I got my money back and was able to get the hell outta there. I stayed at the Econolodge a couple miles down the road.
