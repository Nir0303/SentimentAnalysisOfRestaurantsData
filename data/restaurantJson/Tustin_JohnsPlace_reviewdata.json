When cooked that way they are often crispy (even sometimes burnt) on the outside, but still raw in the center.  What to do?  The decision I made was to order them inside a breakfast burrito at John's.  If they turned out to be bad, why, then I would just eat everything else.  When the HUGE item was delivered by my seat I opened it up with a knife and fork . . . perfect.  The potatoes were cooked just right, and all the way through.

We've been going there for a couple years now.  Went to the one in Orange before this one was opened.  This one is closer and never packed.\n\nFood is of a standard American variety - hamburgers, ham/turkey/steak sandwiches, hot/corn dogs, some chicken, fries, very good onion rings, some Mexican food, decent salad bar, and more.  Their breakfast menu is standard eggs, hash browns, omelettes, bacon/sausage, pancakes etc.  Soda/tea/coffee is all you can drink.  They make excellent breakfast burritos!\n\nThe food is tasty and we've rarely been disappointed.  Prices are fair.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  The staff has always been nice and will modify your meal a little if you need them to.  (If they can do it.)\n\nWe meet up with friends there when we just want a nice place to sit for a while and chat.  I'll go there with my wife on my Friday's off for a casual breakfast without the kids.  \n\nWe definitely recommend it!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-01-30T17:10:03-0500", "location_id": "2104866", "id": "123887814", "user": {"username": "TustinGuy", "user_location": {"name": "Tustin, Calif", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2011-09", "title": "A great alternative to fast food chain restaurants.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33198-d2104866-r118033170-m11068-John_s_Place-Tustin_California.html#review118033170", "text": "When I\u2019m driving around town and have a craving for fast food, I prefer to avoid the big chains and patronize locally-owned businesses.  You generally get more for your money, because that\u2019s the way these local businesses try to differentiate themselves from the national chains.  John\u2019s Place is an excellent example of a relatively small enterprise (3 units in the Orange County, CA area) that is run well.\n\nThe menu at John\u2019s is broader than most chain burger joints, and they feature several nice touches that separate them from the behemoths.  In addition to the usual (but in John\u2019s case, very tasty) burgers and fries, they also have burritos and a variety of sandwiches, both cold (like tuna and ham) and hot (like pastrami, steak and gyros).  If you\u2019d like, you can substitute onion rings or huge zucchini sticks for your fries.  And, they also have a soup and salad bar, as well as baklava for dessert.\n\nTheir breakfast menu goes beyond the typical fast food breakfast sandwiches and burritos; they also have egg platters, omelets, pancakes and French toast.  They also offer muffins and other baked treats from a local baker.  They have a large indoor seating area (all booths) as well as a well-maintained outdoor patio.\n\nOne thing I greatly admire about John\u2019s ownership is their convictions \u2013 they play contemporary Christian music in the restaurant.  It\u2019s certainly not intrusive; in fact, the volume is low enough that the music can be easily ignored.  But for those of us who recognize the music, it is greatly appreciated.\n\nAll in all, if you want a quick, hearty meal in a comfortable environment, you should definitely try John\u2019s Place!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-09-12T14:57:56-0400", "location_id": "2104866", "id": "118033170", "user": {"username": "BruinDan", "user_location": {"name": "Fullerton, California", "id": "32416"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2011-04", "title": "Get a cheeseburger.

Beats out any fast food joint.And I hear breakfast is not too shabby. My kids go out Saturday mornings for pancakes with Grandma while I sleep in.\n\nI like the remodel, and I appreciate that you don't have to wait on a boring server, when all you really want to do is eat.
