It's small and always busy at lunch. For the most part customers don't linger so it isn't hard to get a booth. I like it because, even with a lot of customers, one can hear the person talk sitting across the table from them. That's not something common in fast food restaurants at the noon hour here in our city.  Always friendly, always clean and always terrific hot dogs & fries. My favorite is the chili dog with their wonderful tasting hot french fries.\nMy partner and I always try to eat here at least once or so every 3 to 4 weeks and will continue to do so.

The fries are not as warm as they should be and my order included many short, overcooked ends. I wouldn't serve fries like that.
