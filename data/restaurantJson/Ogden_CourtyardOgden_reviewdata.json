Nicest Courtyard either my husband or I have ever been to. Next time we go to the Tetons/Yellowstone we'll definitely stay here again, so thank you.\n\nVIEW - Awesome!  We were on the 6th flr facing north - great view of the mtns, old court house, Mormon church trumpeting angel, etc.  \n\nLOBBIES - huge...  and there are several (main, lounge, business ctr, bistro). You could spend your spare time in the lobbies w/TV's & just rent a bed & bathroom to sleep in!  \n\nBEDROOM - VERY clean, possibly new?  Great use of space, outlets are all off the floor & attached to each lighting fixture or under wall-mounted TV.  (TV is small for today's standards but you can always go back to the lounge/lobby.)  Very comfortable sofa & lots of room to relax & walk around.  Best of all - THE BED WAS NICE & FIRM. Most comfortable night's sleep @ the end of an 8-day vacation.  Room d\u00e9cor is streamlined or \"state of the art\" as Marriott calls it - not my taste but it's a business hotel.  VERY spacious, nice size mini fridge & microwave are out of view.  \n\nBATHROOM - nice size shower with great water pressure!!  \n\nBISTRO - breakfast choices were nice (not free @ Courtyards) + Starbucks. They even offered dinner here, which is a great idea for Courtyards.  (Kinda silly for this one, you're 1 block north of a street with a dozen restaurants!)\n\nBASEBALL FAN??  1 block from Lindquist Field, home of the a Dodgers minor league team, Ogden Raptors.  Can see the scoreboard from the room we were in, $6 general admission.  Be sure to sit in the comfy firepit lounge chairs outside the pool for a nice way to end the evening w/a free fireworks show from the baseball field every Friday!
