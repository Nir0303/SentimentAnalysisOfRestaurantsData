At that point I told them we had wasted enough time waiting and we were going out and would come back after the check in time.  We walked over to the National Geographic exhibit and then came back, after check in time, and we still had to wait a few minutes for the room.

The location is good, the facility is quite large. This is clearly an old apartment building that has been converted to a hotel. I have stayed at several of these types of places in DC, and they usually offer large rooms with kitchens. The Beacon is no exception. I had a lovely large room with big windows, a comfy bed and a full kitchen. Many of the features in the room have been updated sometime in the recent past. So what's the problem?\n\nThe details are not perfect. Cleanliness was a big issue in my room. Dust, bits of stuff on the black carpet (bad choice, guys -- black?). Huge issues in the bathroom. The floor had clearly not been cleaned for some time. There were spots everywhere, hairs (my personal pet peeve) on the floor and in the tub, dirty shower curtain liner. Yuck. I wore my shoes in the bathroom. Just because you have marble-patterned tiles doesn't mean that we can't see the spots and hair. This type of thing says to me that housekeepers have too many rooms and are too rushed to do a complete job (not enough staff). Something stuck to the underside of the door handle to my room. Then grime in the common areas, including fingerprints and smears of gunk on the elevator panels. The same smears were there the whole time I was in the hotel, while two or three staff people were always hanging out in the lobby chatting it up. Where is the manager?? Put these people to work! When you stay at a true luxury hotel, the staff is constantly polishing every square inch of the place. That is what makes it special. \n\nThen there were more maintenance-type issues: lumpy pillow, missing panel below the AC, window that didn't quite close, dings and scratches on all of the room doors... the types of things that get missed when a place is just not quite fully staffed.\n\nRestaurant was good, if a little odd. Lots of floors to the place. Seems like it has an identity crisis. But service and food was wonderful. \n\nThis could be a truly great DC hotel if someone comes in, hires a few more people, and then insists on fixing all of the little issues all over the hotel. If not, this hotel could slip to a two star pretty fast.
