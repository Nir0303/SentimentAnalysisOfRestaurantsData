Steaks get defrosted and thrown into the microwave, if you do not believe me just ask your waiter.  I came here a couple weeks ago and ordered a half sandwich and a chicken caesar salad.  Probably the most pathetic salad I have ever seen.  About 75% of the salad had no dressing on it and the amount of chicken they gave you is little to none.  I ate only about half the salad and the waitress said, \"looks like you just ate the good stuff\" yes i did because no one likes eating room temperature dry lettuce except my turtle.  The half sandwich I had was room temperature and tasted way to sweet.
