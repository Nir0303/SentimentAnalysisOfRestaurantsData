The initial offering of chips and salsa was some of the worst I've ever had.  Really.  The chips tasted not only days old, but deep fried a few too many times..  The salsa, or hot sauce was of the watery red variety.  This was unacceptable.\n\nDishes we tried included a variety of tacos that were fair but not overwhelmingly good.  Beans were ok, but the rice was again old.  \n\nService was good, as he obliged our request for a significantly better salsa to try, and he offered a sample of a variety of meat called tinga that we had not experienced before.  The bottled soda that we ordered was really big, and great value for the price.\n\nAll in all, I probably wouldn't go back, although I did like the feel of the out of way, dusty road feel to the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-02-03T07:55:44-0500", "location_id": "852850", "id": "252428203", "user": {"username": "Scapegoat51b", "user_location": {"name": "Escondido, California", "id": "32358"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-07", "title": "Best Tacos Ever!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32524-d852850-r135848925-m11068-Taqueria_Yxtlan-Indio_California.html#review135848925", "text": "Get the tacos de lengua and the tacos de cabeza, and get a horchata to wash it down.\n\nI am going back there very soon, see you there!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2012-07-30T20:49:36-0400", "location_id": "852850", "id": "135848925", "user": {"username": "Conan B", "user_location": {"name": "Tucson", "id": null}}}]}
