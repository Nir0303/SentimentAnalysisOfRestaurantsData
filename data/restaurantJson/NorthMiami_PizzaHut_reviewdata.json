Well, it seems I could. My Order was not ready when I was told to come get it. They have my food to someone else and the Service was extremely slow and treated like a Number instead of being treated as a valued customer.....a patron. The lady at the register didn't care at all That I was trying to have dinner night with the kids and on top of that, refused to adjust price. None of which was my fault. I didn't ask for anything for free. Just to be given the correct food for the correct price. The entire staff there just didn't care. \nIt is VERY EVIDENT that they take their jobs for granted and are complacent. Never going back there again. I refuse to be treated like that again. Horrible....HORRIBLE image of what PIZZA HUT USED to be. Now they are so corporate oriented instead of family oriented. So sad. \nNow more then willing to entertain the idea of Papa Johns.... Or elsewhere.
