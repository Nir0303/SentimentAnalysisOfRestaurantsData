It is just amazing and whether or not you are a vegetarian, you will love this!!!\n\nWe've also tried the Veggie Wrap--while good, the Press is better.  Also the Mediterranean Starter plate--which is huge and more than enough for dinner.  The Side Salad could use some love--great dressing but the salad is clearly an after thought.\n\nSeveral other vegetarian options on the menu we will be trying but there's lots on there for meat lovers too.  \n\nGreat beer selection and Bota Box for the wines (along with a couple of others).  Great place for dinner and a evening drink--especially if you are pleasantly tired from climbing in the attached City Rock climbing gym!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-09T13:55:43-0400", "location_id": "10459500", "id": "381229207", "user": {"username": "Kelly M", "user_location": {"name": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "id": "33364"}}}]}
