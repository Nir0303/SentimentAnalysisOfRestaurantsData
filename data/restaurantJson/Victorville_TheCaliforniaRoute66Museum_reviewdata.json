It's a small museum that could be easily lost of if you didn't know about it. It's just off the I-15 in old Town Victorville. It's an easy detour on your way to/from Las Vegas and Los Angeles.\n\nI was greeted by a cheerful lady named Cathy who explained the museum to me and told me a bit of the history of the museum. Everything is donated and there is no admission. She encouraged me to make a purchase in the fun store as a way to help the museum. \n\nThis is a small museum in 3 rooms or so. It is crammed with fun items pertaining to Route 66 and life in the heyday of this iconic road that crossed the USA. I know that Europeans have a particular fondness for Route 66. I guess it's their idea of living the American dream. The guests before me that day were from Slovakia and Sweden so people do make a special effort to visit this museum.\n\nStep behind the front of a Volkswagen van to have you picture taken in the 1960's Free Lover but the big treat of this museum is the 1917 Ford Model T Truck. Yes, you can climb aboard and have your picture taken behind the wheel. How many times does one get to go INSIDE a Model T? This fun adventure makes the museum well worth the visit.\n\nThe rooms are filled with historical memorabilia and information on the days gone by of Route 66. Although it may not be a must-see and go out of your way to see museum, it is worth the visit if you are passing by Victorville, California. It's an easy detour from the I-15.
