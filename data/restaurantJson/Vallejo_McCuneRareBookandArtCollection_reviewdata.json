The non-profit houses an assembly of rare books, antiquated printing presses, various prints, illustrations, maps, pop-up books, and so on. The Donovan J. McCune Room, located on the basement floor of the JFK Library in Vallejo, California, is operated by a small group of passionate, knowledgeable volunteers. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not university-educated or don\u2019t know a thing about print-making; you don\u2019t need to have prior knowledge of this type of thing before coming to visit. The volunteers will expertly guide you through the materials, answering questions that you may not even know to ask, in a straight-forward, easy-to-follow manner. The most refreshing part about the McCune Collection is that the volunteers openly encourage visitors to engage with the collection by allowing visitors to hold, handle, and page through books that are over five hundred years old. The McCune\u2019s casual, welcoming environment is perfect for all types of learners, including those who prefer to learn hands-on and one-on-one.\n\nThis was recently my third visit to the collection in the last few years, and I\u2019m always astonished by the extensive breadth of materials to view, touch, and explore. Although the venue may seem small and humble from the outside, I recommend allowing at least a couple of hours to peruse the wealth of curiosities that you will discover\u2014most likely, in just an hour or two you will only be able to scratch the surface of taking it all in. \n\nSome of my favorite selections in the vault include a copy of The Consolation of Philosophy from 1491, originally written by Boethius in the sixth century. Ask the volunteers to share the story of Boethius who composed this book while in prison; his text reflects upon the transient nature of fame and wealth, suggesting that all we can ever have are the values we hold within us. The McCune Collection, additionally, contains an elegant William Morris rendition of Chaucer, created in 1896, with stunning and intricate illustrations by Edward Burn Jones. It\u2019s fun to compare this version to older, more modest versions from previous centuries, which they will also show you. Also, request to see an example of fore-edging while you\u2019re there. The volunteers will show you a tiny scene painted on the gold-paged-edges of a small palm-sized Latin book. The paintings are invisible when the book is closed, but flip the edges up or tilt them down and the cityscapes of London and Paris will reveal themselves to you! For something varied from the book scene, remember to ask to see the linoleum-block, botanical prints of Henry Evans. \n\nThe best way to see the collection is to request a private tour, as the collection is only available for walk-in-access a few times a month, but is always available to see by appointment. Call to schedule a visit in advance at 707-674-4082 or just email them at mccunecollection@gmail.com to set-up a time to come by. For those who live nearby, the collection is open the first and third Tuesday of each month, from 2 to 4pm, and also in the evenings for Second Friday Art Walk in downtown Vallejo. It is always free to visit!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-13T11:57:46-0400", "location_id": "1545069", "id": "288622792", "user": {"username": "LaRagazzaPigra", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Collins, Colorado", "id": "33423"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Wisdom of the Ages", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33212-d1545069-r286165900-m11068-McCune_Rare_Book_and_Art_Collection-Vallejo_California.html#review286165900", "text": "The McCune Kelmscott Chaucer paper/puppet show was a delight.

It starts with a leaf from the first book made with moveable type - the Gutenberg Bible (1450). They have 6 more books printed before 1500. These are called incunabula.  The great thing is that you don't have to just view these items behind glass cases. They will bring them out and let you sit at a table if you are interested in reading or just viewing them. One book I looked at for a long time was a 1517 edition of Virgil's Aeneid. It had page after page of illustrations of Aeneas journey from Troy to Italy, including a journey into the underworld.\n\nAnother great book is the Kelmscott Chaucer. This was printed in 1896 by William Morris with 72 illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones, major pre-raphelite painter. It is a large book like the large bible you see in a church.  At the end of the May and the beginning of June, the Magical Moonshine Theatre has scheduled puppet shows at the McCune using some of the illustrations from this Kelmscott Chaucer.\n\nThere is also a working 1852 Albion Printing Press and other printing presses there.  It has a large collection of binding tools.\n\nThere are too many rare books to list or see in one visit. A good place to start is their website: http://www.mccunecollection.org where they list many of the items in the collection. It is easy to make free reservations to see the collection on days or hours when they normally wouldn't be open. Just email them (mccunecollection@gmail.com) letting know your interest and possible days and times and they will work to get you in.\n\nThis sight is near the Vallejo ferry terminal and also a few blocks from the Vallejo Naval and Historical Museum at 734 Marin.
