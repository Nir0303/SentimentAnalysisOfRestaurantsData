The Fried Chicken is excellent in taste but their portions are less than average. If you want and order a chicken breast, you might get 1/3 of a breast. If you like dark meat, go for the three thighs. That is a good deal. Best to go when you see the parking lot full, that way you know the chicken is fresh. Often times one of your three pieces is a re-fried piece.
