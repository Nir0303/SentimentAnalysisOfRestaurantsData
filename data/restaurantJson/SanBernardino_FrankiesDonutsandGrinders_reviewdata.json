I asked if I could get another one since she had touched it and the new one also had gold flakes in it.

It is located about two blocks from the San Bernardino County Courthouse. They have great donuts and apple fritters, although I try to avoid them for health reasons, but I really love their grinders. I have had many different kinds of grinders and liked them all, but I particularly love their vegetarian. Their bread is thick and crusty, yet soft, the vegetarian sandwich has pickles, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, onions and mayonnaise and is nicely seasoned. I recently drove from Redlands to San Bernardino just to have this sandwich for lunch.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-09-25T03:42:22-0400", "location_id": "7107100", "id": "230840363", "user": {"username": "Robert C", "user_location": {"name": "Redlands, California", "id": "32953"}}}]}
