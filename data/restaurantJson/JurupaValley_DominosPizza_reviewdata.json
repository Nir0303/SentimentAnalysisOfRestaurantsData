I called and when I told the girl there is a fly baked into the cheese in the order I just picked up, her reply was \"what the heck?\"  She then went on asked me which one of the two was messed up and I told her I would be bringing the entire order back since I don't want my family to have cold meal, to which, she said no, she could only replace the one that is messed up.  She quickly said okay when i said I want my money back.\n\nWhen I got there, she never even look at the fly, just gave me my money back and walked away from the counter.  Never once say sorry.  Someone's health is in question, is \"I am sorry\" too much to ask for?\n\nThe three pictures I am going to post...well, DO NOT zoom in on the two of them if you are the type that would throw up easily...\n\nAnd thanks Domino's for making me wanna throw up at the sight of pizza.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-24T21:35:25-0400", "location_id": "5586678", "id": "303103083", "user": {"username": "immonkey1", "user_location": {"name": "Riverside, California", "id": "32978"}}}]}
