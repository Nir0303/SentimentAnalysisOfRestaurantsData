I have dined here several times as a business traveler staying at the hotel, not just out of convenience, but also because I think it is one of the best restaurants in Eau Claire. It has an urban big city vibe but with local Wisconsin ingredients and cuisine theme. Service is generally good and waiters are fairly attentive. Prices are moderate-range, probably little expensive for Eau Claire but on par with any big city sit-down restaurant of similar style. The food is great, love the salads and the cheese plate and the wine list is great too. My only complaint is the menu is small and in several business trips I feel like I have exhausted the menu, especially being vegetarian, options are limited here. There seem to be a lot of pork products on the menu, which would be quite limiting for anyone eating kosher as well. Wish they would have a pasta or another veggie dish and wish they were a little more healthy-oriented and used more variety of veggies, grains, etc. The one veggie dish they have includes smoked food, which I avoid due to being unhealthy. The pizza is good veggie option though and the desserts are absolutely delicious, the lemon sorbet with fragrant edible petals was to die for, can't wait to have it again when I go back there, one of my favorite desserts ever!

The downtown location is great, the sharp lines, large windows and modern atmosphere are wonderful, but the food was a BIG disappointment. And the food is what makes or breaks a restaurant.\n\nWe began our brunch with Bloody Mary's that were watered down. It was not that the alcohol was too little, but rather that the mixer that was used was a very pale red color and pretty much tasteless. We even asked for some additional mixer and it barely helped. This is not a hard thing to make properly!! \n\nFor our meals one of us had eggs benedict (very bland hollaindaise sauce) and the other had their signature burger. The burger tasted OK, but was way overdone. I asked for it medium rare and it was at least medium well which totally ruins the burger. While I know I could have sent it back, we were eating with a group of 4 and there is nothing worse than 3 people eating while the other one has to wait for their food. The key to getting properly cooked food is not to send it back if it is done wrong, but rather for it to be done right the first time. A competent chef can easily make a burger as ordered.\n\nA very disappointing meal!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Terry V, Owner at The Informalist, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for your input.

The seating areas are neat with clean lines. We started our meal with the smoked Trout Cakes which were delicious!  Loved the sauces. Our meals were wonderful and served pretty quickly.  I had the Trout entree and my friend had the Margherita pizza. We were there on a Thursday evening around 5:30 and the place filled up by the time we left with all the people going to the Sounds Like Summer concert in Phoenix Park. The park is a short walk away as is the parking ramps for parking.  The restaurant is located in the Lismore Hotel which has it's own parking ramp. Cost is pretty reasonable for parking.  There is also street parking but on a summer Thursday night in downtown Eau Claire, it's a little harder to find a spot.
