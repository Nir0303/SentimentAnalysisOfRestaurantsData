We didn't try any of them, so don't know the pricing for the concessions. I have been to numerous productions here and they are yet to start on time. It seems they wait on the inconsiderate stragglers and late comers to be seated before beginning the show, ignoring the majority of patrons who are seated well before curtain time.
