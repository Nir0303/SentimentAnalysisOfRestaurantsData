We had seen mixed reviews but always like to make up our own minds. \nFirst let me say the food was absolutely delicious, the pasta was obviously fresh and handmade. My daughter's calzone was huge and stuffed so full of cheese and the other ingredients that when you cut it open it oozed cheese all over the plate, absolutely wonderful. \nOur server was friendly and very attentive. But, we walked into the restaurant a little bit before 6 PM, the manager immediately asked us if we had a reservation even though there were only three other tables that had people sitting at them. He then went ahead and told us that it's always better to have a reservation because this is their busiest time and that they can never guarantee us a place to sit. I appreciated the fact that we might have needed a reservation and we were prepared to not be able to eat there. But, the condescending overly self-important attitude of the host/manager was irritating. Considering he felt it was such an upscale place that everyone needed to make a reservation I was quite surprised when he just pointed at a table and told us to go sit there. He did this to everybody that came in. Most of whom did not have reservations. When we left at 8 pm half the tables were still empty. \nWe were getting ready to go, our leftovers were in boxes, he came by and asked us if we wanted a bag for food and we said yes, he then proceeded to toss a bag into the middle of our table for us to put our own food in to. I'm perfectly happy to put my food in a bag, but if you're going to put yourself out there as a fine dining restaurant you at least need to treat your customers like you want them back. Making a reservation does not make a person likely to spend more money or make them a more important member of society. This really rubbed me the wrong way, he also may or may not have realized there were owners of a neighboring restaurant in eating. \nI am speaking only about the manager, our server was delightful, the food was wonderful and I would say it was a fine dining experience, we will definitely go back, I'm not sure if we will make a reservation.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-06T17:45:13-0500", "location_id": "8428990", "id": "345487121", "user": {"username": "LGold123", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Great service, great pizza!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56584-d8428990-r341930535-m11068-Palermo_Pasta_House-Round_Rock_Texas.html#review341930535", "text": "Small, you need a reservation for peak times, we went a little early on a Fri. night, 6:00, and got in no problem.
