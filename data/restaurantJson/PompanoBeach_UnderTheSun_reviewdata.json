He kept us informed as to how long it would take to get there and different sites along the way.  His driving was confident but surprised we didn't get stopped for speed as he passed a policeman.  The entire trip took 5-6 hours which took us to an Airboat Tour of the Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, and Hollywood.  He recommended two restaurants for lunch and we opted for the pizza place and it was excellent.  You received a free coke for being with him if you ordered two pieces of pizza which were huge and was enough for two of us.  Mitch was very informed and seemingly really enjoyed serving us.  We stopped at a famous homemade ice cream place on the way back for an afternoon treat.
