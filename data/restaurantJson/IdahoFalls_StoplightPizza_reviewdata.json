The stuffed cheese sticks were excellent.  We selected Italian sausage for our stuffing, and really enjoyed them.  The side salad was good, but nothing special.  It was just a simple salad with Italian oil and vinegar dressing.\n\nWe enjoyed \u201cThe Farmer\u201d specialty pizza.  It has bacon, ham, pepperoni, Italian and spicy sausage, onions, green bell peppers, mushrooms, banana peppers, jalape\u00f1os, black olives and lots of cheese.  The pizza dough is made fresh daily using the owner\u2019s personal recipe, and the pizzas are baked in a brick oven.  This results in a nicely browned and crispy crust that is very flavorful. \n\nMost of the ingredients are prepared fresh daily, and the owner even pickles his own jalape\u00f1os.  Takeout orders are available, but if you enjoy a crispy crust, I would advise eating your pizza in the restaurant.
