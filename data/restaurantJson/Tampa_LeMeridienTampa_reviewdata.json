Last year we stayed at the Epicurean in SoHo and loved it but wanted something different this year and liked the $40 price difference at Le Meridien, too. We were delighted with this decision, and here's why:\n\nLocation \n\nSince Le Meridien is in downtown Tampa, it's within walking distance of Channelside, the Riverwalk, and many quaint downtown lynch spots. We didn't bring a car so parking was not an issue. Uber cars are everywhere downtown so it's an easy pickup, but Le Meridien eliminates the need for most Uber rides, because...\n\nAmenities\n\n...Le Meridien offers complimentary shuttle service to anywhere within a three-mile radius. The shuttle drivers are extremely courteous and accommodating, and we found them helpful in recommending sites, restaurants, etc. this is a tremendous value. The rooms offer complimentary coffee (unlike Epicurean) and the pool is very nice, if a bit small and shaded by the downtown buildings. The lobby is functional but not fancy, the bar is very nice though didn't exactly seem to be a thriving piece of the downtown nightlife. The bartenders were very nice and quite skilled at mixology. They have Yuengling on tap, and for that this Midwesterner is always grateful. \n\nRoom\n\n12-foot ceilings give even the smallest rooms a spacious feel. Everything about them is great. We were on the second floor, just above the pool and I noticed no noise. Mini fridge is an added bonus as there is a liquor store around the corner and we could stock it with cheap drinks. Have to remember that next time. I did join the SPG club (free) and got free WIFI and free access to the hotel bicycles in doing so. Another added plus for this hotel. \n\nHotel Ambience\n\nThis place is very cool, very unique and as someone who appreciates classic architecture and reclaimed buildings, I loved it. Floor to ceiling marble and amazing woodwork highlight the interior. The grand stairs outside make this a natural for wedding pictures. This would be a fun place for a wedding reception. \n\nConclusion\n\nThere are more elegant hotels in America. There are more exclusive settings. There aren't many that offer a better combination of those things at a more reasonable price, though. Add in the shuttle, the service, the cool architecture, and the convenient location in Tampa, and Le Meridien is pretty much unbeatable. We paid $150 a night here for the smaller room and saved a great deal using the shuttle. I'll gladly stay here again. Many thanks to Thomas at the front desk and Steve the shuttle driver--their service was excellent and they make their employer look even better. Well done, Le Meridien.

Our entire experience with the Le Meridien Tampa was flawless from start to finish. Monica, Marshall, Ivan and Kristi on the Le Meridien events team were total rock stars. They were so on top of every detail of the day, from booking tons of room reservations for our wedding party and many(!) family members who were coming in from out of town, to coordinating with all of the other vendors to make sure everyone knew when to arrive and what the timeline of the day was, to setting up all the decor and food perfectly on the actual day. Our engagement was about a year long, and for the whole length of it the Le Meridien team was always very responsive whenever we had questions and would always reach out if they had any updates for us. They were very transparent from the start about how much everything would cost and we truly felt that they were helping us to make the most of our budget and have the best experience possible.The actual reception itself was beautiful. We had 100 people in attendance and the ballroom was the perfect size for people to mingle, dance, and eat while still feeling like they were in an intimate setting. People could not stop talking about how gorgeous the hotel was (they thought it was so cool that it used to be the courthouse!) or how good the food was. Every member of the staff that we or our guests encountered was extremely pleasant, helpful and courteous. Our guests who were staying at the hotel also loved that there was a great restaurant and bar downstairs and an awesome pool, and that everything in downtown Tampa was within walking distance!

I'll definitely be back!\n\nMy sister, who lives in Tampa, loves historic buildings, as do I. She and I also intended to spend a lot of time downtown during my short visit to see her. Ambiance and great customer service are important to me during my leisure stays. And so, given those factors, I chose this lovely historic (yet modern!) old Federal Court Building, which is perfectly located amongst a whole host of downtown Tampa activities.\n\nI could not have chosen a more perfect hotel! \n\nSometimes I choose very casual, mid-level hotels for my leisure stays, and other times, I like things a little more upscale. For this visit, I was hoping for upscale, and I found it here at Le Meridien Tampa.\n\nNow when I say \"upscale,\" I really mean that like just the right amount of \"luxury.\" Too much \"luxury,\" and I feel out of place. I'm pretty casual, and I feel best in comfortable, relaxed surroundings. But the \"upscale\" and \"luxurious\" factors I look for are outstanding customer service; pleasant, helpful employees; attention to detail; surroundings in great repair; and an aesthetically pleasing ambiance that completely relaxes me and makes me go \"aaahhhh.\"\n\nI like simple, casual luxury. And this place has it in spades!\n\nFrom the time I walked in the (side) door (which serves as the front door), the front desk attendant greeted me with such pleasant, welcoming helpfulness. She told me all about my room, which I think may have been an upgrade. Her demeanor made me feel so welcome and so at home.\n\nI had specifically requested a quiet location, a high floor, a corner room, and a king bed. The problem was, none of the rooms that were available that day could meet all 4 of my requests. The attendant explained this to me and assured me from the get-go that if the (upgraded) room did not meet my desires, she would be very happy to move me to a different room until I found one that suited me. (Noise was my main concern, and this room was located on the third floor and fronted the busiest street. Which gave me great pause.)\n\nI went up to my room and discovered that it was hot and smelled like ... maybe pets? I wrote the smell off as a result of the heat. Sometimes, hotels leave the AC off until just prior to the guest's arrival. So, for all I knew, the AC was working just fine, but had only recently been turned on. After all, I did arrive early and my early check-in request was granted! :) \n\nAfter about 10 minutes in the heat, I went back downstairs to ask if the AC may have very recently been turned on, or if that room may have an AC problem. She said that was certainly possible that it was just turned on, but just to be sure, she insisted that she send an engineer up to my room. The engineer was there in a matter of minutes, and he was fantastic! A cut above, for sure. He was friendly, helpful, conscientious, polite, and a great communicator. I was impressed. \n\nThe AC seemed to be cooling the room fairly quickly at that point, so we both agreed that it was probably fine. He still insisted on giving it a thorough check, though. Sweet!\n\nAfter he left, I sat in the room for about 45 minutes taking care of some business on my laptop. The room was huge and decorated very nicely in modern grays and whites. Two of the walls were filled with windows and lovely views (though I kept the room-blackening shades most of the way down to help with the heat). Beautiful! The bathroom was large, modern, and attractive. The modern, armless, leather chair I was seated in was oh, so comfortable!\n\nBut, the AC began to act up again. The room got hot and muggy ... and it continued to smell a little like ... wet dogs? damp wood? not sure ... and then after 15 minutes or so, it started to cool down again. Then hot again. Furthermore, as I sat there working, I became aware of a bass beat and the very faint, but very present sound of ... maybe techno? ... music. It began to irritate me. The pulsing bothered my ears. It didn't sound as though it was coming from outside. Rather, it sounded like it was coming from the hotel. Where? I don't know. Maybe the bar below me or the lobby? Was it piped in music I was hearing? It was not loud in any way ... but it was definitely present and pulsing, and that's the kind of thing I try to avoid by asking for \"your quietest location.\"\n\nAnd so, with some embarrassment, after already getting help with the AC (that, for a time, appeared unnecessary), I traipsed back down to the front desk and asked for a different room!\n\nThe two ladies at the front desk (I think one of them was a manager) could not have been more accommodating and friendly about my request! They put me right at ease and absolved me of any embarrassment. SO NICE. \n\n(Btw, I'm pretty sure they told me that pets are not allowed -- which would seem appropriate in this type of hotel -- so it probably wasn't pet-odor that I was smelling in the first room -- but I can't tell you what it was. It was a stale, old, subtle smell, but I never smelled it in any other location of the entire hotel. I suspect that either somebody did sneak their pet into that room before me, or that maybe the faulty AC in that room contributed to the subtle, unpleasant odor.)\n\nThey moved me to a \"downgrade\" from what I had originally requested, which, based on the things I most value in a room, was a total UPGRADE in my book! I LOVED my new room! On top of that, they adjusted the cost difference in my favor based on the fact that my first, prepaid room was a higher category than my new, totally dreamy room! THIS is exactly the kind of customer service I hope for when I book a Luxury hotel. THIS is what I want when I seek out \"upscale.\"\n\nMy new room was gorgeous! It was a bit smaller than my first room, but it was still plenty spacious. It had three huge windows -- again, the high-quality blackout shades were mostly rolled down to keep out the heat. But that was all at my discretion. The views behind them were lovely! I had an old, beautiful church outside one of my windows. Ahhh. \n\nLike the other room, this room was decorated in relaxing, modern, grays and whites. Soothing. The bathroom was huge and modern, composed of earthy stone tiles and granite, with a walk-in shower (which I love). The upscale amenities were in handy, squeezable tubes instead of the less convenient tiny bottles. They smelled earthy and wonderful in a very unisex way. Perfect! \n\nThere was a perfect-sized built-in, modern gray \"closet\" with shelves and hangars.\n\nThere was a very quiet refrigerator under the counter, which I admittedly had a hard time figuring out. (Digital settings? No rotary switch to set the temperature?)\n\nThe large, flat-screen TV was swivel-mounted on the wall above the long counter/desk. It was easily viewable from the bed; and from the luxurious, armless-but-very-comfy, black leather chair; and from the tall, leather, armed bar-chair that sat at the counter/desk. It seems that these designers thought of everything! \n\nThe bed and bedding were totally heavenly. Firm but soft. Warm but cool. I slept like a total log! In a way that I rarely, rarely sleep. I was in heaven here.\n\nThe central AC was very quiet and instantly adjustable. Perfect!\n\nThis fifth floor room was quiet, quiet, quiet.\n\nThe pool, while a simple, rather small rectangle, was somehow divine! Pristine white towels sit conveniently in racks as you approach the 1st floor door to the pool. I had the place to myself. The area was largely shaded in the morning (by tall city buildings and palm trees) but the furniture was very comfy and the downtown surroundings were surprisingly serene! The pool water was perfectly warm for me -- not too warm, and not cold.\n\nThe 2nd floor restaurant and bar area were GORGEOUS! Such ambiance! Plenty of cozy, yet modern seating in the \"lobby area\" adjacent to the stairwell, elevator, and bar area. (There's also a lobby downstairs -- the main lobby -- which has a whole host of interesting comfortable, modern furniture of its own.) \n\nMy only bad experience at this hotel was in this restaurant. I went downstairs to order to-go, but the two very-happily-socializing male employees never noticed me. There was ONE table of 4-5 men finishing up their midday meal in the restaurant. I was the only other person in the place. After 5-6 minutes of waiting around, I finally walked over to them and interrupted them. \n\nThe one guy gave me a lunch menu at my request, but then he disappeared. I had to again approach the second guy to order, but he informed me that lunch ended at 2pm. (I arrived there at 2:10 -- by the time I got the menu and looked at it, it was 2:20.) I was about to leave hungry, but then it occurred to me to ask for an all-day menu. Yes, they had one. (Did he not think to offer that to me after he told me that the lunch menu was done for the day?)\n\ni ordered a spinach salad with strawberries, walnuts, prosciutto, and \"a topping of warm brie.\" Sounds great! \n\n10-15 minutes later, he showed up with my salad in a to-go container with no bag and no utensils. (No bread or crackers either, which most hotel restaurants provide without asking -- I didn't ask, and I don't require them. But they ARE usually provided at hotel restaurants.)\n\nI pointed out that I was a hotel guest and would need utensils. He asked me, \"What sort of roll-up would you like?\" Hahaha!!! I had no clue what he was talking about! He explained that I could have a cloth napkin with metal silverware or a paper napkin with plastic utensils. I thought the disposable ware would be more convenient, so I asked for \"paper and plastic, please.\" About 5-10 minutes later, he brought me cloth with metal silverware! Haha.\n\nIn his defense regarding how long it took him to get the silverware for me, he was surprising me with a tiny plastic container of extra brie cheese. You see, on top of my salad, there were two tiny slices of brie -- about 3/4\" long x 1/2\" wide x 1/16\" deep. Tiny, tiny slices. Two of them. That were cool, if not cold. That was my \"topping of warm brie.\" I had asked him whether that was the normal \"topping of warm brie\" that came on the salad (love that brie!), and he said, simply, \"Yes.\" But while he was back there getting my \"roll-up\" (lol), he was also kindly getting me some more brie. Nice!\n\nHowever, all in all, he seemed very distracted, unprofessional, and not well-trained. A nice guy. But ... hotels of this caliber usually do much better. I was, after all, the only customer in the place at this point. \n\nI took the salad up to my room, with the cloth napkin and silverware, and ate it at my very nice counter/desk in the comfy armed, leather, bar chair.\n\nThe salad, which was $13 before tax, left a whole lot to be desired! There was nothing special about it. The dressing was meh. The prosciutto was warm and stringy and just not very good. The walnuts and strawberries were very far and few between. And most surprising of all, the strawberries appeared to be thawed from frozen! I guess it's good that there weren't many of them, haha! This was the type of salad I've purchased at TGI Friday's to-go counters in airports. Boring and not special in any way. (Well, the spinach was fresh and the replenished brie was tasty.)\n\nTo my surprise, when I returned to the hotel late that night, after a totally delightful afternoon and evening in downtown Tampa with my sister, I noticed two phone messages. One was from the front desk. She wanted to be sure I was happy with my new room because my happiness was important to her! Aw!!! And the other, MUCH to my surprise, was from the restaurant. She (the restaurant manager) said she had heard that I was initially not happy with my salad and she wanted to follow up and ensure that I was satisfied. (I wasn't, honestly. But it was late at night before I knew she had called, and I didn't really care at that point. I still don't. But I thought it would be helpful to include, here on TA, an honest evaluation of all the services I used during my stay.) Btw, the only complaint I verbalized about my salad, and only to the guy, was regarding the minimal \"topping of warm brie.\" So I was surprised that this manager knew about my dissatisfaction. The guy must have passed it along, to his credit! \n\nI failed to mention the \"coffee shop-like\" counter and refrigerated shelves that exist alongside the restaurant and bar area. They sell a few pre-packaged salads, wrapped sandwiches (I think), coffees, sodas, and a large variety of eclairs there. Oh, my goodness, the strawberry eclair I had there in the morning was scrumptious!\n\nMore about the hotel:\n\nThere are all sorts of interesting architectural and historic features, particularly in the hallways. They have left a lot of the old courthouse doors in place. The ice machines can be found on each floor behind cute, old-fashioned doors (brass knobs and mottled glass panes on the top with gold-lettered writing -- \"U.S. District Judge Chambers\" amongst other REAL things! -- and wood paneling on the bottom). Charming! There's an historic courtroom that now serves as a ballroom, with fancy ceiling, handsome crest, and wooden paneling. The hallway floors and walls appear to be the original gray and white marble.\n\nThere were two large stacks of newspapers in the lobby in the morning. The Tampa Bay Times and ... I can't remember if it was the Wall Street Journal or the USA Today, haha. I went with the Times.\n\nThe fitness center was ... either on the fourth floor or the fifth floor overlooking the city buildings. It was long and narrow with plenty of cardio machines and some weights. It was in great repair and was inviting enough. Good AC, too.\n\nThe impressive and imposing courthouse steps lead up to the second floor bar, which somehow seemed so very appropriate. (That's why I mentioned earlier that the side door is used as the \"front\" door to the lobby, below. The actual front doors to the old courthouse, at the top of the imposing steps, lead to the upper level bar above.) The bar area is simply stunning. Lots of polished wood. Handsome. Glowing. Inviting as all get out.\n\nAs a last aside, the General Manager of the entire hotel contacted me via email about another minor matter that didn't bother me in the slightest. I hadn't even complained about this matter. And yet, I was surprised to see that the GM contacted me to follow up! He was as friendly and welcoming as could be! No wonder this property seemed to be so well managed and HAPPY. \n\nTHIS is exactly the sort of thing I look for when I take the time to seek out an upscale, luxury hotel. This GM and his staff were perfect in every way. The entire stay (minus the less than polished restaurant experience) was ideal. Perfect. The exact kind of thing that keeps me coming back. \n\nThis is just a super charming, very special, very boutique-y place. I adored the juxtaposition of modern and historic. I basked in the amazing customer service. I will definitely be back! You must try it out!

We only stayed one night with the main purpose of going to Berns Steak House. \n   Check in was smooth and I was able to use our free drink cards at the bar for drinks. Our room wasn't the biggest but it was perfect for one night and barely being in the room.  The bed is extreme comfortable, one of the best SPG ones I've been in; so that's a huge plus. The bathroom is decent and the high ceiling are great. \n  Nice hotel, good service, fairly priced, and very unique. Great Hotel for the price and service.
