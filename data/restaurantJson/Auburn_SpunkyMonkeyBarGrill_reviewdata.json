I had been there 2-3 times soon after Restaurant Impossible did the makeover, and the food at that time was wonderful (the salmon with sweet potato hash were great!), though a limited menu was put in place so that the quality could be kept up. However, right from the start the service was poor due to obvious lack of training, standards and supervision. So when I went back last year I wondered how it would be, so started with drinks in the \"restaurant area\" before ordering any dinner. The place was a dirty mess, the service was TERRIBLE, and we were the only people there for food.  Everything seemed to be reverting to what the place really is...a bar with karaoke, pool and dart boards, NOT a restaurant.  The drink & service were so poor that we couldn't even consider eating there, so moved on.  I remember how filthy the food prep area and ice machines were when RI arrived, and it's an easy guess that it's reverted back to that.  It seems pretty obvious that the owners don't give a hoot about cleanliness or running a bar-RESTAURANT.  I'm sorry to write such a critical review, but I'd feel bad if someone ate there and got sick. I hope the owners can find a business model that suits them better...obviously just the drinks/pool/darts/karaoke crowd IF they can make a go of it.

First of all, it's a strange entry having to go up a bunch of stairs. Right at the top of the stairs in the entry/circulation area they had a table with people seated which you had to go around tightly to get to the rest of the restaurant (fire hazard anyone?) \n\nThe menu was just a single piece of paper. I asked about one lunch option and the server couldn't even describe it well at all...so, ended up ordering a blue cheese burger. Once it arrived, I was pretty shocked to see it with just 5 little Jo Jo's that they tried to \"stylistically\" arrange on the plate. I stared at it going, \"are you serious?\"  \n\nThe server lady pretty much plopped it down and ran off, so I had to quickly call to her if I could get some ketchup. Uh, duh..its a burger and jo jo's people! She then came back with this very small half filled cup of ketchup. I had to ask if I could please get some more or just have the bottle. But of course they couldn't bring out the bottle!  \n\nThe burger itself was pretty good, but was a bit underdone (I asked for medium and it had a bit of pink in the middle). Otherwise it was ok.\n\nSo, after sitting getting a bit upset at the ultra small food servings, I finally asked the server why they served just 5 little jo jo's and she said something like, \"well, we were just featured on a food channel show and that was their menu serving.\" I was pretty much in shock hearing that from her...hello, I DON'T CARE you were on some show...don't shortchange your customers!   \n\nAnyway, the whole place gives off a stench of hipster pretentiousness. It was pretty obvious that they were more concerned with how a plate looks (a few cutely arranged Jo Jo's), than giving their customers an actual honest meal.  That act might work in Belltown or Kirkland, but is soooo out of place in Auburn. I highly recommend staying away, whatever \"food show\" they were on has obviously gone to their head.

The service is excellent and attentive.  The chef has delivered our food and chatted with us about our experience.  The owner has been present and attentive as well.  Our service has been very good.  We continue to appreciate the experience and will continue to frequent the Spunky Monkey.  I highly recommend the Caesar Burger (they have a great Caesar Salad).

It's going to take more than a fresh coat of paint & some new furniture for me to go back.  I had not gone before the tv show came in, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I went in last night with a party of 8 for cocktails.  We waited & waited for our server.  There were only customers at 2 other tables at the time, so she wasnt busy serving other people, so I dont know what took her so long.  My husband asked what type bourbon they had.  She told him to get up & go look for himself, that it's on the far left end of the bar.  Uh, no.  We got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time.  She brought my husband's bourbon neat instead of on the rocks.  We can forgive that.  She went & got him a glass of ice & he poured it himself.  She said she would bring water for everyone.  She got half of us water, but not the other half.  She never came back to see if we needed another round.  A friend of mine that works at a different restaurant in town was there.  She came over to say hi & asked why our glasses were all empty.  Because our server hasnt come back to check on us.  Anyway, a while later,our gal comes back.  Not to ask if we needed anything, but to tell us her shift was over & she was leaving & our new server would be over.  Time passes, she finally comes over.  By then we had given up hope of getting another drink, so we just left.  We were one row of tables away from the bar.  Yes, I coulda waved my hands around & gotten somebody to come wait on us if I wanted to bad enough, but that's not my job.  It's THEIR job.

It had THE BEST Tiki Jungle theme decor!!!!\n\nWe always loved the tropical feel, and the way this restaurant had separated itself from the Typical Hipster scene.\n\nWe are so GROSSLY DISAPPOINTED with Spunky Monkey's choice to allow Restaurant Impossible to absolutely obliterate, and RUIN, their main theme.\n\nWhile we never believed this restaurant was 'in trouble,' or in need of any type of facelift (for heaven's sake, it was MEANT to be UNIQUE), we know that the owner's decision was most likely made in hopes of drawing a new/different crowd.\n\nWell... they're going to get that.  Unfortunately, there is no longer ANYthing that distinguishes this place from every other linear, watered-down, faux-Hip eatery.  It looks just BORING.\n\nPlain and simple, the real draw has always been the THEME.  It was like a good old Trader Vics, but it was just \"down the street\" and a lot more affordable.  Tiki bars in the U.S. are all but non-existent anymore.\n\nFact: we liked the food; but it's the kind of food you can get anywhere else.\n\nA lot of folks buy into the idea that \"change is good.\"  And we agree in some cases.  But don't fix what isn't broken.  This little Tiki charmer was such a great little escape for so many years!  Gone are the wild tropical plants, and the wonderful, colorful walls.\n\nIt's just a shame.\n\nOur decision to post this review was made because we certainly don't want any new patrons to be confused, deceived, or disappointed by what they find at the Spunky Monkey.  Sadly, the original Tiki Tropical Jungle Theme at the Spunky Monkey is no longer.\n\nWe hope the best for this restaurant, and guess that most regulars won't be fair-weathered fans.
