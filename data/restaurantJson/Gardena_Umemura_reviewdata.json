Whether you get the traditional Shio ramen flavor, miso ramen or something else, it is all good.\n\nToppings are generous & also fresh & tasty. The fried rice is also very tasty.\n\nNot a fancy restaurant, but delicious.  Also, fairly small in size, so come early, or expect some wait between 6:30 - 7:30 pm. They do turn the tables quickly, so the wait typically is not long and it's definitely worth it!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-23T21:23:20-0400", "location_id": "952065", "id": "375983223", "user": {"username": "DCM2015-1", "user_location": {"name": "Belmont, California", "id": "32060"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Authentic Heavenly Ramen - FRESH!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32422-d952065-r318792627-m11068-Umemura-Gardena_California.html#review318792627", "text": "Want authentic Japanese ramen?  Freshly made noodles, deliciously light broth, tender chashu all in a generous bowl of deliciousness?  Umemura is your MUST have place!  I've tried ramen in Southern Cal and NorCal and this is the only place that fulfills all parts:  fresh, tender, flavorful, authentic and generous portions.  My \"Go to\" dish is the Chashu ramen. Not only does it have a generous amount of pork and noodles, but the broth is delicious!  My son had the BBQ pork with miso broth and said it was the best, most tender ever.  Extra toppings may be added and in very generous portions.\n\nThe Chahan (fried rice) is flavorful and filling.\n\nThe place hasn't changed much since my own family started going when they opened, I think in the late 1980's.  New paint, lighting, fixtures.  Seating is limited and they take CASH ONLY.  Go early for seats. It's very popular, especially for the Japanese community.\n\nThe service is very prompt and friendly. The bathroom is uber-clean.\n\nWhenever we're back in the area (original Nisei So Cal girl), it's the first stop we make whenever in town.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-14T18:01:42-0400", "location_id": "952065", "id": "318792627", "user": {"username": "JTM_Saratoga", "user_location": {"name": "Saratoga, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Excellent Japanese Noodle House", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32422-d952065-r267182855-m11068-Umemura-Gardena_California.html#review267182855", "text": "Uemura's has excellent noodles with several different soup basis and ingredients.
