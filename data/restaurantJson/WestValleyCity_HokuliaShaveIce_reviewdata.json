THIS is shaved ice.  YES there is a difference.  It is fluffy and light and a little piece of heaven.  I first experienced it in Hawaii and when I saw the stands here, I just about flipped...and then when I saw one right down the street....I knew I was in trouble.  You can get them with just the shaved ice and flavor, or you can get them true island style with a scoop of vanilla, coconut or macadamia nut ice cream in the bottom of the cup, the shaved ice, your favorite flavor of syrup( or two, there are 50 flavors to choose from!) and then you can top it off with a sno cap, which is sweetened condensed milk, or a spritz of sour spray, or a sprinkle of Li Hing Muy Powder which is a little bit sweet, a little bit salty, and a little bit sour!!!

We were quick to go check it out. They have a bazillion flavors and combinations and you can get ice cream and/or sno cap added to it if you'd like. The prices seem reasonable and the flavors are delicious. The service was friendly and efficient. The ice is finely shaved rather than crushed, so no ice bits. It absorbs the syrups really well with a nice texture. We ordered the Big Kahuna size, Black Cherry and Pineapple and shared it between 2 of us. Very Nice!! :)  We'll be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Stephanie W, Manager at Hokulia Shave Ice, responded to this review", "text": "We're so happy you had such a positive experience at Hokulia!
