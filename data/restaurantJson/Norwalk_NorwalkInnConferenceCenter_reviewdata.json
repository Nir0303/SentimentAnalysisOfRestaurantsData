Also, one bartenders there was rude but not nearly as rude as the older lady at the front desk when we checked out, she never smiled , never made eye contact. I'm sure once the construction is over the hotel will be great as for the staff, they must strive to provide the upmost respect and good customer service as this is a 3/4 star hotel!

I read the reviews about this place and expected more than what we got.   The staff was pleasant and check in was quick and easy.   Decor is nice but it goes down hill from there.   Walking to our room the halls are stuffy and humid.   The room with 2 queen beds was small and the beds were terrible!   You sink to the floor when you sit down on the edge and the few pillows on the bed were not comfortable at all either.  Even our kids couldn't sleep,  and kids sleep anywhere!   The bathroom was missing parts,  like the bottom cover of the sink faucet,  and no exhaust fan and wires hanging for a TV I presume.   An air duct was in the bathroom but was obviously inoperable since there was tons of dust built up on it and hanging off the grate.  \nWe were given 2 free breakfasts at the buffet breakfast in the restaurant at the hotel.   We checked it out and after seeing that there  was hardly any food out and what was there was terrible we just had the kids eat pancakes and we left.   Usually my kids we will eat 4 or 5 pancakes,  they each had 1 and said they were done.   Probaly because I needed a steak knife to cut them.  I expected there to be the basic breakfast food available and refilled quickly when we were there at 8 am for breakfast.   At $11.95 a person,  this is again not what I expected.   \nIt's a shame,  the staff seemed very nice and helpful,  but the rooms and breakfast  (or lack there of) soured our stay here.  Sadly  I would not recommended this place.

It is by far the best property we\u2019ve had the pleasure of staying at in our many visits to Norwalk. \n\nUpon entering the suite we noticed the sheer historic value. Then to add all the comforts of having a full kitchen, dishwasher, cabinets with plates and pots and pans, a dining room, and a large living room with comfortable seating and wall mounted flat screen TV made this a property that we could stay at indefinitely. The unite had all the comforts of home and could easily pass as a personal vacation home.\n\nThe location of the property made it very easy to visit Connecticut and New York. In fact there is a short cut nearby that allows you to bypass some street traffic entering the Merritt Parkway. It also wasn\u2019t too far from countless restaurants and Interstate 95 where you\u2019ll find a near direct shot to the beaches.\n\nThe highlight of the room was certainly the bathroom. The bathroom was appointed with a standup shower with a floor to ceiling glass enclosure, and beautiful accented walls. \n\nThe bathroom featured what I considered to be one of the most comfortable showers I\u2019ve had the pleasure of using. After running around in the hot and humid outdoors of CT beaches, the relaxing shower was essential. The rain-shower head gave you the feeling of visiting a spa. \n\nOverall, the Guest House and Norwalk Inn is a wonderful, one-of-a-kind property.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-28T08:03:48-0400", "location_id": "85827", "id": "398446225", "user": {"username": "Nermis", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Beautiful Historic Inn", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33871-d85827-r397080219-m11068-Norwalk_Inn_Conference_Center-Norwalk_Connecticut.html#review397080219", "text": "The hotel is situated in a great location.
