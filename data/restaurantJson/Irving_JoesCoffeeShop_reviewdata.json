The waitstaff was friendly. I ordered the hot links and eggs with hash browns and biscuits and gravy. Everything was perfectly cooked (The hash browns were on the crispy side, however. That is the way I prefer them but some readers may like them a little less done.) What stood out were the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was not over-peppered like most restaurants in the Dallas scene. The biscuits were soft, yet firm enough to stand up to the gravy.

Honestly, I really like the atmosphere\n\nMy wife and I have gone about 4 times now, and so far each time was great!  I've seen reviews about food being overcooked, but not that I noticed.  My home-style fries were a bit well cooked one time though.  Probably depends on who's cooking I guess.  \n\nHonestly, the best thing to me is coming here for supper, ordering something with the salad bar for one of the sides, and getting out of there nice and stuffed for $15 for two.
