Two weeks later I asked before I ordered if they had coleslaw and they said no, yet it is described as having it on the menu.\nBut tonite really took the take. The club sandwich that I was sharing with a friend was not only dry and made with scorched bread and tough bacon it also contained a surprise. My friend made a face and produced an inch of tooth pick from the sandwich, but the mystery was that the four tooth picks used to hold the sandwich were intact. Luckily he had not swallowed it. Instead of the manager coming over as requested we were told by the waitress they would take off a dollar. After another complaint about how unprofessional this was, and how dangerous the situation could have been the very young acting manager finally after more than a few minutes of waiting said she would not charge us. I left a three dollar tip for the waitress, it is not her fault the food is crap.  \nRoyal Oak has gone way down. We just left the pig sty that is Blaze Pizza to go to Leos and this is what we get? Caveat emptor when it comes to absentee ownership in any restaurant or pizzeria. Make sure your medical insurance is paid up before eating at Leos anywhere if this is how they run the place. PS I never get a straight answer on what kind of fish is used in the Fish and Chips. I will not order it anymore. I was at a Leos on 13 mile where they at least had coleslaw but the fish tasted like catfish, not cod or Pollack that you expect minimally when you order fish and chips. No more, from now on I get by breaded North (not Pacific) codfish from Trader Joes and make my own.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-07T21:29:52-0400", "location_id": "6560448", "id": "362431138", "user": {"username": "Wolfman48067", "user_location": {"name": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "id": "42660"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d6560448-r352198851-m11068-Leo_s_Coney_Island-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review352198851", "text": "Once we are done walking at the zoo we go and enjoy a nice salad or omelet at Leo's.
