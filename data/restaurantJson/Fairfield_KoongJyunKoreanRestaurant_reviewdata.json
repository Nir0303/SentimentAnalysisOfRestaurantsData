Then came along Koong Jyun Korean BBQ IN Fairfield. If you want a good Korean meal and to lazy to drive all the way to Oakland this is your restaurant. The tables are well spaced and if it was crowded you wouldn't be bumping into people. We came in during lunch for their special (lower price) than dinner. We were greeted and seated right away and after looking at the menu we ordered. I had bibimbap in a hotpot, love the crunchy rice at the bottom, my son had the chicken teriyaki and his mom had the short ribs. Even if the \ubc18 \ucc2c [banchan] side dishes were skimpy I ordered 3 more. The food was excellent! The way I gauge that is how my two companion reacts to the food. My son will always have his unfinished dish to-go when he doesn't like the food and my wife had no single complaint but raved on on how she is enjoying her meal and the most telling evidence is the empty plates! Anytime you can please a picky and a finicky eater at the same time is Definitely two thumbs up! Highly recommend and looking forward to eating here again. The prices are moderate and service was good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-22T07:33:14-0400", "location_id": "4893079", "id": "395476432", "user": {"username": "Sijimboy", "user_location": {"name": "Vallejo, California", "id": "33212"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Mr ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32367-d4893079-r378863439-m11068-Koong_Jyun_Korean_Restaurant-Fairfield_California.html#review378863439", "text": "Excellant food, great food.
