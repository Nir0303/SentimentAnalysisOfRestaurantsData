The servers are so nice and welcoming.  The food was temperature hot and got to our table really quick and that was nice due to having to go back at work in 45 minutes.  The atmosphere is really clean.  Don't expect top of the line fancy place with an elegant feel.  It is awesomely clean, nice and tidy and a real comfortable place to go in a casual atmosphere.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-24T09:15:38-0400", "location_id": "795172", "id": "236065181", "user": {"username": "Robert N", "user_location": {"name": "Springfield, Illinois, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Best Thai in Springfield", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60887-d795172-r232962501-m11068-Mekong_Cafe-Springfield_Illinois.html#review232962501", "text": "This restaurant has the best Thai, Viet and Lao food in Springfield.
