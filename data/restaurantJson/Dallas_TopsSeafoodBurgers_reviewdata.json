I thought \"okay a burger sounds good\". Looked over their menu posted outside and was skeptical since they also had asian cuisine.  The owners were asian and me and my boyfriend decided to order from the other side of the menu.  I got pad thai and he got sesame chicken.  Both dishes were amazing.  The ladies working were very nice and the restaurant was clean.  The patio was relaxing (although not actually outside). I'm glad I stumbled on to this establishment.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-21T15:54:30-0400", "location_id": "4105417", "id": "260956179", "user": {"username": "Megan C", "user_location": {"name": "Roatan, Honduras", "id": "292019"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "Full Menu- Excellent Service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d4105417-r159078528-m11068-Top_s_Seafood_Burgers-Dallas_Texas.html#review159078528", "text": "This hole in the wall located on the edge of Downtown Dallas (next to the Dallas Library) is wonderful. The have a huge selection on the menu from burgers, fish, chicken fried steak to Asian....and excellent Asian to add. I eat here often due to its close to my office, it's cheap & mostly the food is good. The drunken noodles, Thai Pad spring rolls are always delish.... (Skip the ice tea- not so good). They have daily specials (around $ 6 bucks)  - the service is always above average...The sweet lady that either owns the place or is the manager -always calls you by name...& if you haven't been to visit them in a while she calls you out on it...I love places that appreciate my business & this place truly does. A great lunch spot for a little change....you will not be disappointed.
