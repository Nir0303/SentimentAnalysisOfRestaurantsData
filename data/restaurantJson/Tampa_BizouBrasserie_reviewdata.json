(The restaurant and bar menu at Bizou are the same.)The dinning room had only two tables of customers at 7 PM on a Saturday night, so that should have been a clue. The bar fared a bit better, but no one else seemed to be eating -- just drinking. Pleasant service from the friendly bartender did not make up for oily, rubbery escargot that tasted like they had been microwaved, then crowned with a pre-fab puff pastry. Perhaps it is unfair to judge a restaurant from one dish, but this little foray set us back $43 with tip for one barely edible appetizer and two glasses of wine, so I can assure you we will not be returning.
