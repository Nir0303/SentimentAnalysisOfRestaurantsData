Love the food, the good coffee and their location right next to the Union Pacific railroad tracks.  Can eat and watch trains at the same time.  Friendly staff.  Senior discount.  G-gauge train runs around on a track hanging from the ceiling.  Best ham and eggs anywhere.  Have taken many friends and groups there.  Will be going back ASAP.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-16T18:21:33-0500", "location_id": "918561", "id": "333423483", "user": {"username": "Paul S", "user_location": {"name": "Fair Oaks, California", "id": "32365"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Fast Service, Nice Help, Good Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32988-d918561-r333110395-m11068-Pacific_Street_Cafe-Roseville_California.html#review333110395", "text": "We dropped in here Saturday morning because it was close by.  It's kind of a hidden hole in the wall but once you go inside It is apparent this place is well known.  Lots of people eating, but still plenty of room.  We didn't have to wait, ordered food right away and didn't have to wait 30 minutes for it to arrive.  I got \"Mark's Mess\", sort of a scramble with potatoes, cheese, eggs, etc.  Really good. Mashed potatoes aren't real, but we didn't really expect them to be.  I highly recommend this place and we plan on returning next time we're in the neighborhood.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-15T11:40:51-0500", "location_id": "918561", "id": "333110395", "user": {"username": "Labguy1", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}]}
