I found the interior spacious and comfortable, the staff friendly and the food delicious.  I tried a javaccino for my drink, a coffee/chocolate concoction.  There must be some internal dissent about how to best create it, because the young ladies who served me asked me to try a sip, then tell me what I thought.  If I didn't like it, they would make me another beverage gratis.  I tried it - and it was watery, not what I expected.  They had made that with milk.  I suggested cream, got a second try and it was delicious.  I felt like I was helping them perfect the coffee menu.
