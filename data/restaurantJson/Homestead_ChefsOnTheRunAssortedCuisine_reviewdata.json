We went to this restaurant to venture into our hometown, looking for a good place to eat.  Let's  admit it, homestead is not known for wonderful restaurants.  This place is no different.  With only 8 tables, 3 where open.  We stood at the door way for a few minutes, while the guy in the front was on the phone.  There is no sign to sit yourself or to wait to be seated.  Eventually we went to sit ourselves.  The 1 waitress was a tad rude and told us to wait to be seated.   Ok, so we overlooked the waitress deminer and went back to the entrance to wait.  At his point we figured it would be fast.  To our surprise we waited over 5 more minutes and still did not get acknowledged.\n\nIf people are at your restaurant willing to spend there money then the least you can do is give them a decent greeting, which we didn't get.  The guy on the phone simply just walked away into the kitchen, and the waitress never came to get us. My spouse decided that we should leave. For a restaurant the size of a single bedroom,  and a greeting area the size of a personal restroom, 5 minutes is 1 minute too long.  \n\nMy advice is to greet your customers, let them sit or sit them and let them know you will be with them shortly.  This way, they feel acknowledged and believe it or not it is an unspoken gratitute for their business.  As we were walking out the door, the chef popped his head out the kitchen window, and i said \" I really wanted to try your food, but you should get better servers.\"\n\nNeedless to say, we will never return or try the food here.

As I am gluten and diary intolerant it is sometimes difficult to find a restaurant who caters to my needs, Will went out of his way to make sure I had the choice of a range of side dishes and the ribs he recommended were delicious. He was so knowledgeable and a real Ambassador for the Restaurant. The Chef even made a point to speak to us.  Both men were very passionate about what they do. Highly recommended.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-04T18:16:01-0400", "location_id": "2452058", "id": "401524622", "user": {"username": "deniseandmark2016", "user_location": {"name": "Brisbane, Australia", "id": "255068"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Best burgers!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60739-d2452058-r397068314-m11068-Chefs_On_The_Run_Assorted_Cuisine-Homestead_Florida.html#review397068314", "text": "This restaurant is very small if you go it's best to make reservations.
