It was busy but not crazy.   Had to go to bar to get attention & seated; understaffed for being holiday & weekend. Long time to order & we had to ask if we could get something to drink.   Tamela (sp?) was great & spoke english so she kept coming from behind the bar to help & wait on us after initial waitress left & didn't return after taking our order.  There were young kids there & music was good- not too loud so could talk etc.  \n\nThe  awkward part was having 2 security guys walking -\"SECURITY\" very largely printed on their shirts.  1 had fully loaded vest & what looked like a taser gun.  Not sure if they've had trouble there or was preventative but took away from the atmosphere &   very distracting. In most other restaurants you don't see security hanging so close to tables etc.  \nFood was decent & reasonably priced.  Asked for small Margarita & waitress brought huge- turns out it was $11.95 . When my husband protested that it was too large, she laughed & said he'll like it.

It has a very awesome spacious area of seating, and section for people to enjoy some dancing, a nice full bar with TV showing recent news, sports and anything else you would like to watch.  AND THAT'S JUST THE MAIN FLOOR!  This place has second level which also has a full bar and seating as well.   \n\nWe were greeted with smiles and was sat immediately.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, the specials for the day, both food and drinks,  and also gave her personal recommendations.  \n\nWe had complimentary chips and salsa we ordered some guacamole to go with our chips and another staff member came by with a cart and made it fresh right there in front of us.  I was very impressed, she asked if we wanted to our guacamole made a particular way.  We got to customize the flavor to fit our mood. I loved this! \n\nWe ordered Sopes and also a Tacos Ahogados (a specialty platter).  You get very good portions of food with your order.  Which makes this place a shoe in for those big groups that want a nice place to take in some authentic mexican cuisines.  The food was amazing! \n\nTip:  Please be aware that if you do ask for guacamole, the restaurant staff member that makes your fresh batch get tips separately from your waiter.  So please be mindful of that as you enjoy your evening.  She definitely earned my tip!  I wanted to take some extra home. \n\nThere is a huge value here, being in an active downtown area.  This place has great portions of food for the price you pay.  And the drinks specials also equally as great!  Try the Original Margarita or the Mango Margarita.  Both are huge in size and also a great buy! \n\nI am a Resident Recommended Ambassador for the Elgin Area.\n\n#ResidentRec", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-03-02T11:16:52-0500", "location_id": "3928631", "id": "153549387", "user": {"username": "saulbhp", "user_location": {"name": "Elgin, Illinois", "id": "35942"}}}]}
