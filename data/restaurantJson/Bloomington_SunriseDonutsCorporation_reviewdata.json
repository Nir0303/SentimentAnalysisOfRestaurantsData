I had recently gone to Donut Star in Burnsville right off the Eagan border and was sadly disappointed in the donuts but this place made up for it big time! The donuts were moist, savory, sweet and the delicious! The chocolate was thickly coated and hit the spot. Would completely recommend visiting this hidden Gem. It is in the white bear shopping center. There's a big polar bear on the sign by the entrance but their sign is hard to see as it is underneath somebody else's sign that I believe said Paw Spa. Hope this review gets them some more business as good donut shops are hard to find these days. Good luck Sunrise Donuts I will be back!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-19T15:08:45-0400", "location_id": "894854", "id": "420328572", "user": {"username": "Bryan T", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Awesome donuts", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43323-d894854-r351601628-m11068-Sunrise_Donuts_Corporation-Minneapolis_Minnesota.html#review351601628", "text": "Just got some this morning and they melted in my mouth!

We don't usually make it in early in the day...more like mid-morning. The selection of donuts at that time is usually slim...but that's to be expected. [I don't believe they make more during the day?] They are only open until like 1 or 2PM anyways...so makes sense. Regardless...we never have trouble choosing and always enjoy what we get. I always add a cup of coffee to my order...because really...who can eat a donut without coffee? The inside isn't terribly small...and offers several seating options...even a couch/chair set-up. The decor is alright...my favorite part are the old photos of Bloomington [where this shop is actually located...not Minneapolis as the address above suggests...making it difficult to find to even review.] that adorn the walls. The dining area and restrooms are always well-maintained and clean. The guy who typically works there is always friendly and helpful as well. The location can be a bit tricky to find if you're not already familiar. It's in a strip mall...except in the middle section...which continues along the middle inside of the building. There is also a small courtyard outside of the shop where during weather-permitting months...you can enjoy your pastries outdoors. I think it's safe to say...we'll always return for a tasty treat!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-10T08:58:20-0500", "location_id": "894854", "id": "346634563", "user": {"username": "StarletteSkye", "user_location": {"name": "Murderapolis", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-03", "title": "Get there with the Sunrise for the best of everything", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43323-d894854-r127213844-m11068-Sunrise_Donuts_Corporation-Minneapolis_Minnesota.html#review127213844", "text": "This donut shop is family owned and operated and it shows in the great quality and friendly service.
