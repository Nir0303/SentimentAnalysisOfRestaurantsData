To give a back story I have worked as a server in both bars and restaurants at multiple establishments over the past 7 years and never seen anything to this extent. I am amazed this place is still in business. \nThe evening started with us seating ourselves as the sign instructed. The place wasn't very busy, Thursday evening, 7:20 to be precise. We promptly seated ourselves at the bar and talked for upwards of thirty minutes prior to being acknowledged by the staff whatsoever. Rather than being greeted and made to feel welcome the server rushed us as if our presence was imposing. As soon as we ordered a round of waters she rushed off without allowing another word. We planned to order beers and an appetizer at the same time. Ten minutes later she came back with the four waters and spilled mine all over both the bar and myself. No big deal, Accidents happen. She did promptly get me a replacement. Though she immediately left again as I was initiating our order, cutting me off. After what seemed an eternity I approached a manager and informed her that we were still without anything but water after surplus time and requested that they send us our server. During the fifteen minute hiatus between our server's return we decided to clean up the dirty dishes that plagued our seating area and had been present since our arrival. \nOnce our server finally returned we were once again rushed through our order. Keep in mind we are only just now being allowed to order anything past waters after forty five minutes of being there. We ordered our appetizer, nachos, we requested the jalapenos and sour cream come as sides rather than on top as not everyone wanted them. Of course when they came out the sour cream was right on top of the nachos and there weren't even jalapenos present. She grudgingly went off to fix the error after making us feel bad for even fretting over the discrepancy. The new nachos were soggy and cold but we agreed to hold out in hopes of the service turning around. That was the last time we ever saw our server. \nWe conferred amongst each other regarding the fact that our beers were still non existent as we sat and ate our nachos. Upon finishing the nachos we waited another ten minutes or so and concluded not only that the beers were never coming but it would be hopeless to attempt to order an entree. After two brutal hours of being baited we called it quits. \nI settled the bill with the manager and we left for the 54th Street bar just down the road; we had great service with a wonderful atmosphere.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-11T20:56:00-0400", "location_id": "882388", "id": "279637743", "user": {"username": "BarGuru4", "user_location": {"name": "Lee's Summit, Missouri", "id": "44588"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Greasy food, poor service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44588-d882388-r266614098-m11068-Peanut-Lee_s_Summit_Missouri.html#review266614098", "text": "Stopped in for the first - and last - time Friday evening.\nHad the fish & chips which was a mistake.
