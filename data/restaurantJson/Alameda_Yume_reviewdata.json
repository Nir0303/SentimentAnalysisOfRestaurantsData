Once seated, there was a sign behind the sushi bar that read no pictures are allowed inside.  Hideki was first up on preparing the sushi and his mastery of using the knife was impeccable.  Midway thru the course, they changed chefs and we ended up with 13 pieces.  The use of different ingredients on top of the sushi was excellent.

He is all of these things!  The reason Yume would not survive in Japan is because of the sheer rudeness and complete lack of class displayed by Hideki's wife.  \n\nAnd before any of you try to go native on me, here's the deal:  My father was born in Kobe and raised in Yokohama.  And I lived in Tokyo for several years.  So I think I know what I'm talking about when I say that no people take customer service more seriously, and more to heart than the Japanese.  And so, no matter how delicious the sushi might be, Yume would not survive in Japan, because the Japanese people would have no tolerance for that kind of behavior.  None whatsoever.

The son came out and blew me off but it was clear they were more interested in the larger party waiting behind me. This has been my favorite restaurant for the last couple of years but recently they've raised their prices, redecorated, and brought their son in ( who is not nearly as skilled as his father but presents a lot more attitude). Sad to say I will not be going back and I would strongly discourage anyone from eating here. We were very excited about their change in policy about allowing parties larger than two but it looks as though we'll never get the opportunity to experience this.

Obviously they don't like children, since that's really the only purpose such a limitation serves (any group of more than two adults can simply split up).  That for me is the last straw, and I won't be back.  Kamakura around the corner is not quite as good, but it's cheaper and the owners and staff actually act like they want your business.
