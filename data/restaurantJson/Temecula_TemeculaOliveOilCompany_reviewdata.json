What brought us in was the complementary tastings of their farm-made Oils and Vinegars, as well as to stock-up for my trip home. \n\nWhen we entered, we were greeted by an employee behind the register. We told her we were interested in trying the olive oil and she told us to head to the next room where someone can take care of us.\n At first my Mother asked if we should buy some crusty french bread (they sell a few different types of bread by the register), but the employee told us that the olive oil is actually best tasted as is. She said it can be sipped directly. She said that often times the bread will change some of the nature flavors of the oil, so She suggested we try the tasting first and if we still want to get some bread, then we can come back, get some and try all of them again. So we decided to head to the tasting room where we were greeted by an employee who helped us try a few different types of oils. \nNow just to let you know, you are able to taste as many of their oils and balsamic vinegars as you like and are not pressured to buy any (but most people seem to purchase something). After trying several different oils and vinegars (and a combination of them), we ended up purchasing:\n\nRoasted Garlic Extra Virgin Olive Oil ($20.99 per bottle)- This olive oil is incredibly delicious and is only available just after the pressing, twice a year and it sells out fast. You can really taste that roasted garlic. The olive oil itself really is thin so that you can drink it directly (like a wine tasting). I can see making delicious sauces and dressings in the future with this (or just enjoying it with a little bit of bread by itself isn't a bad idea either).\nOverall, service was very friendly. Granted these oils and vinegars are not cheap, but the prices seem to be comparable to other olive oil stores that we have gone to before. I definitely would come back to purchase more oils and vinegars in the future. (By the way, a set of oil and vinegar would make an excellent hostess gift). \nI CANNOT visit my Mother in Sun City, CA without the 20 minute drive to Temecula, just to bring some Temecula Olive Oils, Flavored Vinegars, Specialty Salts, Olive Tapenades, unique gift items (such as the Green Olive Leaf shaped Pasta) and Bruschetta home for my family and friends....", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-20T21:31:28-0400", "location_id": "2312699", "id": "408100921", "user": {"username": "BRENT C", "user_location": {"name": "OMAHA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Olive Oil Tastings!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33165-d2312699-r407245844-m11068-Temecula_Olive_Oil_Company-Temecula_California.html#review407245844", "text": "We came across this place while walking around Old Town.
