We each opted for the buffet.  The salad portion of the buffet was fine but the hot portion was hit pretty hard.

I am sure they made it from scratch in the back but I easily could have confused it for a frozen pizza.  Our service was very good.  The waitress had her cute daughter helping her.\n\nWould I got there again?  Not a chance.  Even if the food is normally better, I cannot imagine it would jump up enough to be satisfactory.

To my pleasant surprise, there was a nice outdoor patio to dine on and a large open seating area inside. We went on a Sunday night and there were a good five tables dining in where we decided to sit. There seemed to be only one waitress in the whole joint doing most of the work with a random girl or two helping out. For as large as the place was, it was strange to see a \"seat yourself\" sign. There had to have been a few more tables scattered down near the bar area, as she kept going down there as well. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgable, but since she was the only one waiting tables, it took a while to get drinks, to-go boxes, the check, etc. We ordered cheese bread and a pepperoni pizza. I also ordered the Italian wedding soup, which was not what I was expecting, but tasty nonetheless. Someone from the back brought out each part of our meal as our waitress attended to others' needs. Everything tastes pretty good-the pizza crust was a little too fired for me and lacked a little flavor, but all-in-all a really good meal for the price. We ordered a medium for 2 adults an 1 kid and had almost half a pizza to take back to the hotel--glad we decided against the large at the last minute! Would definitely return back here if the opportunit arose! Just hope by that time they will have hired some waitstaff!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-08-13T19:54:05-0400", "location_id": "539793", "id": "172145326", "user": {"username": "jlynne08", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-09", "title": "Great food, disappointing service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42835-d539793-r147522062-m11068-Frankie_V_s_Pizzeria_Sports_Lounge-Wyoming_Kent_County_Michigan.html#review147522062", "text": "I have eaten here several times with friends.
