My expectations were far less than what South Bound Delivered.  The atmosphere was great, the service was friendly and efficient even though the place was hopping and to top it off, the food was good!   I had the wings and they were great.  Trivia moved along very slow, but other than that, I can't wait to go back!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-24T15:41:17-0500", "location_id": "8411366", "id": "350677998", "user": {"username": "flyboy1980", "user_location": {"name": "Florida", "id": "28930"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Don't bother!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29212-d8411366-r345282703-m11068-South_Bound_Smokehouse-Augusta_Georgia.html#review345282703", "text": "We love bbq!  Love to try other's bbq, but this wasn't good at all.  It wasn't bad... It just wasn't anything!  No flavor!  The smoked chicken barely has any smoked flavor to it and the texture was more like sawdust than bbq.  The pork has little flavor.  The hush puppies are very good, as are the pork rinds.

It was wonderful!\n\nKevin was our server and he was so helpful. He gave suggestions, answered all our questions, and was very attentive.\n\nBecause we couldn't decide on what to order, both my mom and I ordered The Godfather. That gave us a good sampling of ribs, wings, pulled pork and pulled chicken along with 2 sides. It was a lot of food so we both took home leftovers.\n\nWe plan on returning soon. I loved to learn they have trivia (and food and drink specials) on Wednesdays.
