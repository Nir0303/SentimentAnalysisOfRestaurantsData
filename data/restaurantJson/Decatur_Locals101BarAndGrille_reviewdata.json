The variety of burgers is enough to satisfy anyone's cravings, and they even have the central Illinois famous shoes--which are my personal favorite. The beer selection is great. The food is absolutely awesome and for that I'll keep coming back. \nHowever, the service needs some work. My family and I walked in where there were 2 employees standing behind the bar, with no acknowledgement, then a female employee rounded the corner, saw us, then walked behind the bar as well. As my father walked up to the bar to ask for a table a gentleman rounded the corner and offered to seat us. Also, the waitress wear their hair down, which when our waitress gave us our drinks there was a soft drink on her tray for another table, and when she leaned to pass us our drinks her hair got into the soft drink on her tray. Which she then gave to the patron at the next table. A few kinks to iron out... but great food and local sports atmosphere I will come back for.
