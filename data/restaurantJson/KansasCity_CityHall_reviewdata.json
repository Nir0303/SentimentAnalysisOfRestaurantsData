He was very friendly, and told us about how surreal it is going out there on cloudy days, when you can hear all the noises below, but can't see anything through the fog (you're 30 stories up).  The guards we encountered were all very nice, but their first concern is security, so keep that in mind.  You will go through a metal detector, so just don't bring much in with you.  Go in the side of the building with the Lincoln statue, get through security, then take one of the elevators down to the lower level.  They'll copy your ID and take you up to the 28th floor.  It's a super fast elevator!  After that, there are 2 floors of stairs, and a walk through a machinery room.  GREAT photo opportunities from up there, and I could see the spiral of the temple in Independence from that far up!  \n\nParking is typical for downtown.
