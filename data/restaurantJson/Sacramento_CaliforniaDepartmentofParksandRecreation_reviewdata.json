It used to be the our utility trailer with the motorcycles on it counted for a legally towed vehicle. -No extra charge. A few years back they changed it to only one motorcycle and the other was charged at 10 dollars per day. Now they only count the utility trailer as the legally towed vehicle and are being charged 30 dollars per day for our 2 motorcycles.Technically I could get a lawyer and fight it because that is not how it is stated on their website. (They count motor vehicles on the web) but instead of that headache we have decided to sell the motor home and embrace hotels.\u00a0\nWhen I made the original reservations, I was informed a week later that one of the beaches we booked would have no running water and a lot of construction noise. I cancelled that reservation and rebooked another beach. Not only did they keep my booking fee but they charged me a cancellation fee and another rebooking fee. We are fed up to our eyeballs! The State Parks and National Parks have managed to suck the fun out of enjoying camping.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-08T16:37:59-0400", "location_id": "105378", "id": "227803496", "user": {"username": "rstronti", "user_location": {"name": "Auburn", "id": null}}}]}
