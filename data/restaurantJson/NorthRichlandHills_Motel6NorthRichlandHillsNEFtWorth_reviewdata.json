Unlike the other review that is on this hotel we had a very pleasent stay. The rooms are very roomy and our room was very clean. We had everything you would expect from a Comfort Inn. I travel a lot and stay at all types of hotels I just stayed at the Best Western down the road and payed a lot more and the stay was really bad. The only bad thing about the Comfort Inn was it is a little hard to find it is off the highway behind a restaurant needs more signage. The breakfast was fresh and plenty and the housekeepers cleaned our room daily spotless. Dave on the front desk was very friendly and answered all my questions I ask him about the area and the mall down the street. I would tell anyone looking for a nice clean up to date room this is the place to stay when in the area as good if not better than the Best Western, Hampton, Motel 6, Super 8 and the new Comfort Suites at NE Mall.
