The food is ok, but the waiter's service was terrible. My wife and I always ordered two different noodles. They look a like but have different ingredients. I hate my wife's noodle, but my wife likes both of them and is not sensitive of the tastes. The last time when we dined, the waiter misplaced our orders. Insensitive of the taste, my wife ate half of my noodle while I was eating spring rolls. And I realized the noodle was not mine when I was eating it. I told the waiter the mistake politely. Then the guy got angry and said he did not make the food. Now I got upset and told the owner the mistake and his behavior.
