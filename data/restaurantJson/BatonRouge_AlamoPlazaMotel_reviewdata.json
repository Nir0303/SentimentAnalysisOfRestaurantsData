That is the one good thing I can say. On the outside at night it doesn't look terrible but not good either. But after getting inside my room, the ceiling light cover was busted on the floor. The bathroom was a total mess and the bed was downright disgraceful. Extremely old tv, the alarm clock looked from the seventies, the carpet hasn't been cleaned in years, the door locks didn't work right, and the giant finale that made me pack up and leave five minutes after being there..... cover your child's eyes.... the sheets were covered in stains. Not only of the bowel variety but stains that can only come from a male. ( if you get my point) if you don't because your a little blunt, SEMEN. Now I have lived in some terrible places being a Marine Veteran and this is worse than sleeping outside. Do yourself and your family a favor, do not stay here. I'm now staying at the Shades Motel down the street a little ways. Same price but definitely a better option by far.", "helpful_votes": "10", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-01-08T16:08:52-0500", "location_id": "2642516", "id": "190214526", "user": {"username": "dhbanks", "user_location": {"name": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "id": null}}}]}
