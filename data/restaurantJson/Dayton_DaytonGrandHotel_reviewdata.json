The safety latch on the door was loose and not well secured.

I waited and called back two more times. Still no answer so i decided it was time to leave.\nI grabbed my gear and spoke with nice lady at the desk and said there were several problems with the room and I did not feel safe.

No more valet parking, so you have to park in a horrible, filthy garage that manages to stay dark ALL THE TIME.  I don't even know how they do that.  You'd think the sun would shine in there at some point during the day, but apparently not.  It was scary, as was the walk to my room.  \n\nI think when the gal at the front card tables left at night, there were no longer staff on-site.  The bathroom reeked of mildew, which I think was coming from the shower curtain.  That would seem to be an easy fix, but apparently too difficult because of all the \"renovations\" going on.  I was there for four days and didn't see any work going on.  This hotel is a disaster and sites like Travelocity ought to be ashamed of their lack of quality control in listing this with a 73% positive rating.\n\nOh, and I put trash in the trash can near the elevator on the 3rd floor on September 11th.  It was still there when I left on the 14th.  Bet it's still there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-26T13:25:05-0400", "location_id": "217655", "id": "313858513", "user": {"username": "Marianne100", "user_location": {"name": "Parker, Colorado", "id": "33591"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Hotel OK, but parking facility very poor.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60785-d217655-r312458693-m11068-Dayton_Grand_Hotel-Dayton_Ohio.html#review312458693", "text": "Hotel under renovation, check in at makeshift lobby area, but not that bad.

I stayed at the hotel a few years ago, when it was the Doubletree for a wedding and had a wonderful experience. The hotel then was beautiful and made quite an impression on my sister and I. My sister booked her wedding at the Kuhns building, about a block away, so staying at the Dayton Grand seemed like a great decision. When she called in January to block book rooms, she was told that they would be a fully renovated hotel by the weekend of her wedding, September 5 and that because she was booking at that time, she would still get the original prices of the rooms before they switched. It seemed too good to be true, and it was.\n\nThe hotel restaurant, gym, and pool were all closed. In addition, the parking garage had an entire section of ceiling missing right as you pulled in, the front doors had caution tape hanging on them, and the entire lobby was covered in debris, plastic coverings and tape. It looked like no work had gone on in this hotel for quite some time. The poor receptionist was set up in the decrepit lobby on the second floor with card tables and fans pointed towards her as there is no air conditioning in common areas. \n\nThe second day there, two police cars sat out front as they took out an individual who had been staying illegally on one of the floors. Our rooms were not cleaned sufficiently and I had to ask for all of them to be cleaned again and all rooms booked in our block to be double checked before their arrival.\n\nNot once did my sister receive notice that the hotel was still under renovation. In fact, no where on their website do they indicate that they are under construction at all. And to kick us when we were down, the manager denied telling her that renovations would be complete when she made her initial call. No one thought to let her know what to expect. She only found out the day before her wedding when she checked in...thinking she had booked a beautiful place for guests to stay. \n\nIt felt like staying in a nightmare.  Looking back, I guess we should have checked more current reviews, but having stayed there before and having had a great experience, it never occurred to us. After looking at reviews from this time last year talking about renovations, I can't imagine that much work has been done, maybe it will never be.  All I can say is that this hotel was in absolute unacceptable shape for any person of any kind to be staying in. They should have closed to complete their work and reopened. I would not stay here until you've confirmed their work is done.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-07T19:20:42-0400", "location_id": "217655", "id": "307976414", "user": {"username": "Emily S", "user_location": {"name": "Dayton, Ohio", "id": "60785"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Worst hotel in the world", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60785-d217655-r305828964-m11068-Dayton_Grand_Hotel-Dayton_Ohio.html#review305828964", "text": "This is the worst hotel I have been to in the world and I have traveled to over 20 countries.
