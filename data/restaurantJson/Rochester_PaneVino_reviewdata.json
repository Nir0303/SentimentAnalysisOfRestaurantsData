We had prosciutto wrapped mozzarella in a red sauce (Bocconcini) as an appetizer and it was simply delicious. A very small portion for the price, but extremely well done and delicious. For dinner we took the recommendations of our server (Leslie - who was 5 star plus!) and had house made artichoke ravioli and chicken Anthony. The artichoke ravioli was perfect, as the garlic wine sauce was so good it's hard to describe. The chicken Anthony was also something you could go back to over and over again. We ended dinner with a great peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.\nWe sat outside for dinner under the canopy in a charming courtyard.  We weren't rushed and felt welcomed and comfortable from the moment we walked in.\n\nThe night was nearly perfect. Nearly.  I can't end the review without noting the area where PV fell short. After dinner we went to the bar for a drink and to listen to the live music being played in the front bar area. We sat at the bar and were quickly served. A few minutes later I asked the bar tender is she would break a twenty for me so I could leave her an additional tip and have a tip for the valet (which is free by the way). There were five people total at the bar and she was serving the floor servers as well.  So not busy at all.  She smiled, asked me to wait just a minute and she would gladly make change.  For the next 20 minutes she never so much as made eye contact.  Our drinks were empty, the twenty was still sitting on the bar, and we decided it was time to leave.  Maybe it was a bad night, or maybe one or two of the others at the bar were friends that distracted her, I'm not sure.  But we walked out with a small sour taste in our mouths after what was a nearly perfect dinner. I didn't change my rating because the dinner and PV overall was fantastic and deserving of the 5 out of 5 rating. I'm not sure what happened at the bar, but I'm sure it was an anomaly.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-04T05:02:58-0400", "location_id": "674518", "id": "401267111", "user": {"username": "GeneseoSupremo", "user_location": {"name": "Geneseo, NY", "id": null}}}]}
