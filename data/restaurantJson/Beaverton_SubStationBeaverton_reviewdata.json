Friendly staff and tasty food will be found here.  Prices are right also.  About 6 people in line which moved quickly but there was about a 15 minute wait for my to-go sandwich, it is lunch time.  Great fresh bread with lots of meat.  Next time I will ask for more condiments though, it was a little dry for me.  Prep area is really small, (sorry, as a PR Person, I see these things) but they put out a good sandwich so I guess they could make them on a breadboard and all would be well!  While waiting I saw the delivery guy load up a plastic cube full of orders and go riding off into the lunch hour to deliver off his bicycle.  Over all pleasant experience, sort of old Americana.  Great little place, just allow a few extra minutes at lunch hour but do try it, I firmly believe you will enjoy the food and the experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-01T08:17:58-0400", "location_id": "440292", "id": "369257650", "user": {"username": "INEEDAGOODNIGHTSREST", "user_location": {"name": "Grants Pass, Oregon", "id": "51891"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Great Subs!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51765-d440292-r368336115-m11068-Sub_Station_Beaverton-Beaverton_Oregon.html#review368336115", "text": "Best subs in town.
