First appearance, the place if falling apart and needs to be modernized with seats and tables that aren't falling apart. Silverware was dirty, floating items in our water, coffee was weak. We wanted something on the menu that wasn't 2,000 calories, but couldn't find anything. So we made it up and ordered 1 simple chicken breast, homestyle potatoes and coffee. $12-$15 for this simple $6 meal. I inquired with the boss if this was a misprint on the receipt, she said the cost of chicken is through the roof and it might even go up. Sorry, an entire cooked chicken at Costco or Fred Meyer cost $6 and last I checked potatoes were $5 for 10 lbs. That said, the chicken was overcooked and the amount of spuds provided was very little. Coffee was watered down and condiments included salt, pepper which actually gave the chicken and spuds some flavor.
