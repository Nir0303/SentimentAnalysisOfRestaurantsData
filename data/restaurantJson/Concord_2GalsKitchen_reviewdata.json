We weren't expecting much. We came away pleasantly surprised. 2 Gals is not \"fine dining\" - it's \"comfortable dining\", the kind of place I might go with my wife for dinner after church or on a week night. In that category, 2 Gals really excels.\n\nOur plates were generous, but not overloaded. I had the \"Jacked Up Burger\", which features jalapeno jack cheese and a whole jalapeno pepper sliced lengthwise. Very tasty. One person had a turkey sandwich and another had a grilled chicken wrap, and surprisingly, the meat was not sliced as if from a deli - it was chunks of meat. The side dishes were well-prepared, not just afterthoughts as they are at so many places like this.\n\nThe decor is really interesting. The interior walls were brick at one time, then stucco was applied to the brick. Now some of the stucco has been strategically removed, leaving original brick showing here and there. There are lots of rather plain pendant lights hung from the high ceiling, resulting in an interesting effect. I would say 2 Gals is eclectic without being weird.\n\nService was quite good, and the price was amazingly reasonable.
