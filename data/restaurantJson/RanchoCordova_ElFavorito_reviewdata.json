This is very good FOOD restaurant; order cerveza (36 ounce bottles), and enjoy more food than you can eat!\n\nA colleague and I went into El Favorito, and we knew that (while it is a hole in the wall), it had to be great.  Every table was full, and we were the only gringos there.  If you want a well-prepared meal, hearty and plentiful food, and an authentic meal, go here. If you want the marketing hype of a pretentious advertising campaign \u2026 well, we can name a bunch of them.\n\nI must also say that the prices that we paid were WELL under those charged by the slick advertising campaign locales.  So, very good food, quasi-attentive service, great prices, and abysmal margaritas \u2026 come here.  Hey, your hotel has a bar, right?  So get your margaritas there (just NOT at the Marriott \u2026 we had to teach the bartender how to make them, believe it or not).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-08-23T20:25:22-0400", "location_id": "932273", "id": "409796823", "user": {"username": "WGibson648", "user_location": {"name": "Westport, Connecticut", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Very nice staff, very bland food.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32939-d932273-r355827379-m11068-El_Favorito-Rancho_Cordova_California.html#review355827379", "text": "Had a super burrito without rice.
