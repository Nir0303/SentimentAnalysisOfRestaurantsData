We came across this little 50s style burger cafe and loved it. Hot rod pictures, 50s decor, very cool.

The burger rivals any burger we have had at In 'N' Out, and I would say is even a little better!  Sheri, the owner, has formulated her own special seasonings that she sprinkles on the burgers when she cooks them--that way folks with high blood pressure don't have to miss out on a fabulous burger. She made us feel right at home and even gave us a free refill on the coke we shared, and then a free ice cream!
