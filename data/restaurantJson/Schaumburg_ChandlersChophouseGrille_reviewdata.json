In the past we always had good service and food at a fair price.  On our last visit we found that things have changed since our last visit.  We usually picked Fridays because they would have a Fish Fry and have a white fish on the menu.  At one time they would also offer a glass of house wine at a very reasonable price.\n\nOn this visit we discovered that the wine deal was a thing of the past,  and the white fish was no longer on the special Friday menu.  We also discovered that the Fish Fry charged for additional servings.  At one time they brought all you wanted.  They then changed and gave you one additional plate for free.  Now it's $1.99 for additional servings.\n\nSince my wife couldn't get her white fish she ordered the Perch Fish Fry.  Since I couldn't get additional servings of the Perch for no charge I ordered a medium Skirt Steak sandwich.  When I got my order it was very rare.  I sent it back to the kitchen and it came back in about 10 minutes. It looked cooked so I thought everything would be fine.  However my first bite tasted really burnt.  When I turned the steak over it was totally black and really not edible.  Needless to say I sent it back and the manager came to our table.  They offered me another item but by then I had lost my appetite.  My wife's meal was not as good as it has been in the past.  Usually the Perch would be crisp. What she received was kind of soft and not real exciting.\n\nChandler's is owned by Ala Carte Entertainment.  They are best known for their Moretti's Restaurant.  I'm not sure when Chandler's became one of their restaurants but it's just not the same anymore.  That's a real shame because the place has been remodeled and is really nice inside.  But if the food isn't great it's just not worth going.  There are plenty of great restaurants in Schaumburg.
