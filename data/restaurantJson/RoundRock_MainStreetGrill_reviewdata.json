I ordered the steak and shrimp \"any way you want\" and ended up with a fishy tasting meal and the blandest steak and 'blackened' shrimp ever.  Everything on my plate tasted like fish had been put on the plate before they decided they needed the plate for my meal. They did get the fresh green beans right - nice and crisp- but ruined the dish with odd food prep practices. Even the mashed potatoes with blue cheese mixed in tasted fishy. What's worse, a disgusting brown sauce (which wasn't even on the dish description) was dumped on the plate and ran into the meat and potatoes. When I order a $30 steak, I expect to be able to taste it and that it would be savory enough to not need hiding with some kind of sauce.\n\nWe were a party of 8 and made a reservation for an early dinner so the place was not at all crowded, then (6:30 on a Sat.) or at any point through the meal. Hostess was great and returned my message to confirm, but didn't think that we might actually want to have a conversation over dinner. We were placed next to the live musicians who were just too loud for such a small restaurant. It would have been a big production to move everyone so we tried to make the best of it. Even though the waitress asked them to turn it down some, they kept getting loud (they were supposed to be background Christmas music, no vocals).\n\nOthers in our party ordered the grilled salmon or salads. They seemed happy with their meals. The key lime pie dessert was a bad deal - it looked like the kitchen staff kept back a half a piece for themselves. The Round Rock doughnut bread pudding was a hit for those who tried it. The brie appetizer cheese dip was also tasty, but I can't eat wheat so can't comment about the bread. The glass of wine was a decent pour amount for the cost.\n\nOverall, the place wins for ambience, being wheelchair accessible, and for location - downtown Round Rock is so quaint these days.  They did an okay job with the salads and fish dishes, but coming from Atlanta, I have to say, this is overpriced, and the kitchen needs to work on a few things. It was also surprising to see there were no gluten-free options at a restaurant in this price range.

The crab cake appetizer was absolutely outstanding - best crab cake I can remember. My dinner was good - that it was not outstanding may be a function of what I ordered and not the cooking (Gnocchi with a heavy cream sauce - not something I usually order). My dining companions all were more enthralled than I with their meals. The atmosphere is nice and quiet and it was perfect for chatting with the relative we came to visit. When we spilled our wine, we realized that exactly the same thing happened the last time we dined here - and it occurred to us that it is because the tables were not even (two tables together with about an inch difference in height). If they can fix that, it might save a few tablecloths. All in all, it was a very good meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-28T14:07:23-0500", "location_id": "470061", "id": "251533066", "user": {"username": "BarbaraSchiesser", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
