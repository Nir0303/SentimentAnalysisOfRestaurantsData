This review is just a general warning that the service may not always be the greatest.  We were here on a Monday evening and found the restaurant about 2/3 full by the appearance of it.  We were told that we would have about a fifteen to twenty minute wait, which we felt was reasonable.  After a few minutes outside, we were not sure that they would know where to find us, so one of our party went back into the hostess and came out with a pager.  Then two of us remained outside reviewing the extensive menu, and the third person sat at the bar.  About twenty-five minutes later, we still had not been called, so we returned to the hostess stand.  We were told that the wait would now be thirty minutes.  No one had been out to give us any updates, and we were never given a satisfactory reason of why the wait would be getting longer.  The restaurant never appeared to be full.  I realize that it's not always a matter of tables, but sometimes staffing is an issue.  On the other hand, the staffing ought not to have changed between the time that we arrived and after we had waited nearly a half hour, and even if something unexpected did happen to extend our wait, someone ought to have updated us, as it would be only courteous.  Given that there was no guarantee that we would even be able to get in after another half hour wait, we gave up and went elsewhere.\n\nMy friends had been to the restaurant in the past, and had assured me that the food had been quite good, so the restaurant probably deserves a much better review, but it assumes that you can get in.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-22T17:25:03-0400", "location_id": "605467", "id": "385098700", "user": {"username": "AHW676", "user_location": {"name": "Kansas City, Missouri", "id": "44535"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Poor service and sub par food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32243-d605467-r383017235-m11068-La_Pinata_6_Mexican_Restaurant_Tequila_Bar-Concord_California.html#review383017235", "text": "When this restaurant first opened it was a great place to eat and it was a family friendly environment.
