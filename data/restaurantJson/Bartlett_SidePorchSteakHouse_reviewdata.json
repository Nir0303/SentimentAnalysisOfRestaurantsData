Tilapia was cooked until perfectly tender, good and buttery, but just a tad salty. Baked sweet potato was good and came with a side of cinnamon sugar. A glass of wine was a bit small, or rather in too big of a glass, makes for an optical illusion. Over all, yes I would like to eat here again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-18T03:58:09-0400", "location_id": "489563", "id": "319762984", "user": {"username": "bornredprincess", "user_location": {"name": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "id": "60845"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Seafood lover ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55197-d489563-r314568740-m11068-Side_Porch_Steak_House-Memphis_Tennessee.html#review314568740", "text": "I must admit,  Side Porch Steakhouse was more than I expected.

It is a simple place, nothing fancy at all, but there food has always been pretty good. Their homemade croutons were a good start. I had the zucchini appetizer which was awful. The salad came from a bag, covered in cheese  and the dressing was not good. The steak was well cooked just right, seasoned well, and tender. The baked potato was very typical. I can get a good steak other places. I would not come back unless it was a friends birthday , and that was where they wanted to go.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-11T14:01:09-0400", "location_id": "489563", "id": "309352433", "user": {"username": "john m", "user_location": {"name": "Bartlett, Tennessee", "id": "54885"}}}]}
