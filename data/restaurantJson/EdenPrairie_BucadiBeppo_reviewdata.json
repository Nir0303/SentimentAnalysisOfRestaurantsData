There ample parking in front. Entry thru the only doors is directly into the kitchen of the restaurant....don't worry this is part of the show. We were escorted thru a series of small rooms then into seating areas. Walls covered with small framed portraits and black/white pictures of what you might imagine to be Italian genre and scenes. Walls are dark red, furniture dark and the \nrequisite red/white checkered table clothes cover large tables with many chairs per table...this is a place for large groups.\n      \nMENU:   An ample drink/wine menu focuses on Italian wines, beers and drinks (although there appears to be no espresso coffee available !!!!) A fairly abbreviated dinner menu covers the usual pizza, pasta, antipasta, soups,etc. The menu content is heavy on chicken and pasta, although several house specialties are listed, some salads and a few vegetables. Breads are a focus. It is the appetizers that offer the more originality. We had mussels with two different sauces. When we inquired about origins we were told \"unknown\" since they come in frozen bags from distributor !. There really is no clue as to the origins or ingredients of menu foods. There is almost no disclosure or even use of spices or herbs. Nothing is advertised as organic or gluten free. No caloric counts on menus. Its all a mystery.\n    The second noticeable feature here is the size of the portions. It is definitely a \"throwback\" to 1980's giant portions and heaps of food on large plates. Here on the menu it discloses there are two sizes of portioning \"small\" serving 1-3 people and \"large\" serving 4-7+. Food is served on platters, not plates. Individual plates are available, but customers are encouraged to \"dig in\" and serve themselves from the massive platters. Very communal, perhaps not hygienic. The results are not artful.\n\nSERVICE: Hostesses and servers are very friendly and knowledgeable about their menus. While a bit slow in serving, they seem genuinely interested in pleasing customers.  \nTAKEAWAY.....Good idea for a fun restaurant whose menu is stuck back in 1980's. A fresh update in menu, plates, services and portion size would do wonders here.\n\nSUMMARY: A good place for a multigenrational dining experience-but not a good choice for lighter, more modern food tastes.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-16T19:48:57-0400", "location_id": "444799", "id": "356213640", "user": {"username": "deem705", "user_location": {"name": "Edina", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Great but getting more expensive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43028-d444799-r354216167-m11068-Buca_di_Beppo-Eden_Prairie_Minnesota.html#review354216167", "text": "As always the food was great.

No lunch menu offered on a Saturday so we ordered family sized Fettuccini Alfredo with added chicken and prosciutto stuffed chicken (We usually get the chicken parmesan, but wanted to try something different and we were very pleased with the stuffed chicken).  Waiting for our waitress was painfully long.  Finally we were able to order.  We watched another table with a different waitress get seated, get their drinks and bread before our waitress came back to tell us they were out of fettuccini noodles and would we like to wait for fettuccini noodles or take a different noodle for our fettuccini Alfredo?  Hungry, we said, yes, we'd take anything and we would also like our bread.  Everything came at once a few minutes later.  Our waitress disappeared and left us plate-less and with no silverware.  It was also self serve on the refills of water as we were forced to help ourselves to the pitcher sitting behind us on a ledge.  A manager (?) came by and asked us how we liked our food.  We said it was good.  He asked \"was it hot?\"  Not sure why he'd ask that.  We were quite hungry and ate it right away and don't remember having \"hot\" food, but food that was at least edible.  Due to the service given to us here, we won't choose this eatery again.

We actually had to ask the server for more sauce.  The brought what seemed to be a large bowl but didn't help enough.  We also had chicken parmigiana which was ok, but nothing special.  For desert we had the Cheesecake which if you have never had is worth the trip just for desert.  We learned our lesson, there are far better places out there for this type of food.  We might be back to grab a cheesecake to go, but I don't think we will be eating there again anytime soon.  Even with our coupon it was ridiculously expensive.
