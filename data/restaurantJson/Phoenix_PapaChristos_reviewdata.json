The restaurant is located just off the street in a plaza area that offers outside seating, but it has its own indoor seating as well. \n\nI had the pizza lunch special which is two slices and a fountain drink for $6.50 including tax. The pizza is thick-crust (but not the fried-type of pan pizza that a lot of places have) and there are several multi-topping choices available. One of my slices was Mediterranean, but there were also a few other choices with at least 4 or 5 toppings. The slices are very generous, and I thought the flavor was good too, even though I was there after the lunch rush and got some slices that had been around for most of the lunch hour.\n\nThe service was friendly and very fast, so you should be able to get in and out quickly if you're in a rush. The only thing they could've improved would be if they put the slices in the oven for a minute or so after I ordered it to warm it up a little more. \n\nI rate restaurants on here based on how well they're executing on what they're trying to deliver. Papa Christo's offers tasty pizza very quickly with good portions and at a great value, and I'd definitely eat here again.
