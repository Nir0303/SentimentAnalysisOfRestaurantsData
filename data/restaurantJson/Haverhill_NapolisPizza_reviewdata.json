The one thing I've noticed about this place is they have VERY LOYAL FANS!  The first time I was introduced to this place, it was introduced as \"The best pizza you will ever have in your life.\"  My wife's co-worker raved about Napoli's and told her how she would drive like 30 or 40 mintues just to get the pizza.  So we figured it has to be great.\n\nI'll definitely give the pizza very positive reviews - super crunchy crust, but not overcooked.  Really gives you that perfect pizza crust crunch.  Flavorful pizza sauce and the unqiue spin is the cheese.  it's covered in grated Parmesan cheese, not shredded mozzarella or some sort of mozzarella blend.  It's simply grated Parmesan cheese which give it a unique flavor.  Definitely a bit on the salty side.  \n\nThey offer a few topping options and also have spinach and meat pies - I've only tried the traditional pizza and have been back 4 times in total.  For me - it's kind of out of my way to drive to just for pizza and I'd highly recommend calling ahead becasue they only make a certain amount of pizza each day.  once it's gone, it's gone.  \n\nAs there are many takes on pizza, it's certainly worth a visit, especially those of you who like Tripoli, Christy's, Piro's pan/square pizza.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-22T09:11:44-0400", "location_id": "823576", "id": "408776149", "user": {"username": "Keith F", "user_location": {"name": "Methuen, Massachusetts", "id": "41677"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Classic place to grab a slice!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41605-d823576-r407450147-m11068-Napoli_s_Pizza-Haverhill_Massachusetts.html#review407450147", "text": "Classic place to grab a slice!
