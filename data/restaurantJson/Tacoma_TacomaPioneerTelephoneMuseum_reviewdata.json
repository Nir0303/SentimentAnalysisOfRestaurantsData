Staffed by retired ATT volunteers who are passionate about the history of telephones and the phone industry.  The collection is great, but the real fun is learning about how things actually worked from the retired workers.  The building in which the museum is housed used to house 400 phone company employees -- today the whole thing is run by just two techs!  Great collection of old phones, switches, memorabilia, and actual switchboards.  It will all mean very little to anyone less than 50 years old or to anyone who doesn't watch old movies or tv show.  For those of that older generation this is great place.", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-10-23T21:49:16-0400", "location_id": "7218627", "id": "235978018", "user": {"username": "dunnrej", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle", "id": null}}}]}
