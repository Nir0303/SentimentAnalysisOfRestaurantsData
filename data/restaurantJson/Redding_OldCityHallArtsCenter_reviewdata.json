It's a brick box without a lot of character-- it seems its major claim to fame is that it's old. The artwork shown there is mostly local and not much is worth seeing.  Occasionally there are shows of local photographers, which are often worth seeing, but I'd skip most of the other shows of local painters as they are as amateurish as you'd expect in a local art gallery.  The truth is that there isn't much more to do after you've visited the Arts Center.  There is the downtown mall, finally re-opened to the sky after a few decades of being roofed in, and there are a few places to eat and drink in the mall and nearby, but there isn't much else to see of any import.  The Arts Center is, to me, the sort of place you drop into when you're early for another appointment and want to spend 20 minutes.  I don't see it as a \"destination.\"  Others probably feel differently...", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2011-12-05T10:31:02-0500", "location_id": "285814", "id": "121430148", "user": {"username": "Soggiorno", "user_location": {"name": "Chico, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "I just love it!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32952-d285814-r2086439-m11068-Old_City_Hall_Arts_Center-Redding_California.html#review2086439", "text": "I am part of the Artist's Rennicance Theater.
