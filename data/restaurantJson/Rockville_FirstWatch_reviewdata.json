They have a great variety of pancakes and egg dishes, plus during lunch offer some nice sandwich and salad options. I usually go for the old standby of pancakes with bacon and a bottomless cup of coffee though their egg crepe is also quite yummy!\n\nKids will be happy too as they have their own menu. Who doesn't love chocolate chip pancakes? \n\nService is always very attentive - the staff seem to go out of their way to meet the needs of the customers.
