Definitely my favorite pizza places in the area!  The sauce is absolutely delicious!  This is not your typical NY style pizza, but similar to Greek pizza as it is a little thicker.  We usually order extra cheese with pepperoni or another topping; olives, mushrooms, pineapple and pepperoni..whatever you want! You don't need to add extra cheese as they do give plenty of cheese, but we ask usually out of habit.  We usually call this order in and pick it up in 45-1hr later. If we show up early, we will grab a drink at the bar. It  is definitely a dive bar feel and when you go it is quite dark but well worth the pizza!! Andy the owner is usually there and is always friendly!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-04-30T19:08:17-0400", "location_id": "4160360", "id": "369114342", "user": {"username": "Tena28", "user_location": {"name": "Warwick, Rhode Island", "id": "54121"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Great food!
