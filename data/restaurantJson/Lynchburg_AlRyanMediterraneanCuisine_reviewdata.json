We started with a 'Sampler Plate' ($8.95) that consisted of hummus, baba gahoush, 2 falafels, tabouleh and pita chips. The falafels were to die for, crispy on the outside and soft and warm inside with delightful seasonings. The baba gahoush was great, but the hummus was way too salty. Personally, we prefer warm, fresh pita to pita chips.\n\n My wife ordered the lamb kofta platter, and I had the lamb kebab platter. Both platters come with a huge pile of rice, lettuce with an interesting dressing laid across the middle of the plate, and then either chunks of lamb with peppers and onions (the kebab) or a ground spiced lamb patty (the kofta). My kebab meat was tender, plentiful, beautifully cooked and the peppers and onions charred just right - really delicious, but my wife's kofta patty was too salty, skimpy and missing all the lovely spices one associates with kofta - garlic, cilantro, parsley and onions. The salt simply overpowered any other flavor. The platters are $9.50\n\nI had a cup of Turkish coffee - perfectly sweetened and aromatic with cardamon. $2.50 Recommended.\n\nWe finished the meal with pistachio baklava ($1.50). Very good but mavbe a day or so old. \n\nWith the right choices this could be a 5+ restaurant. Go for a falafel appetizer plate and the kebab platter entree and  enjoy!\n\nThis is a tiny, rather nondescript place with only 5 tables for two crowded into the first floor and two additional tables upstairs. Also upstairs by a large window is a lovely arrangement of low divans covered in bright red middle eastern fabrics and carpets along with lots of brass and low tables.

We approached the counter and ordered and they assumed we wanted our food to go. \n\nAs for the quality of the food, it tasted great, but I didn\u2019t feel like I got enough to warrant the price. The falafel was very good, and seemed more reasonably priced, but the lamb that I ordered came with very little lamb at all (maybe 3-4 bites). What was there was excellent, there  just wasn\u2019t enough for a $13 price tag. There was plenty of rice so that I didn\u2019t end up hungry in the end, but there really should have been more meat, in my opinion.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-02-09T11:42:12-0500", "location_id": "4444554", "id": "253411186", "user": {"username": "Ethan P", "user_location": {"name": "Lynchburg, Virginia, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Staff seemed sort of confused...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57919-d4444554-r242519370-m11068-Al_Ryan_Mediterranean_Cuisine-Lynchburg_Virginia.html#review242519370", "text": "Charged my friend's credit card twice.

So, now that its almost 40 years later, Middle Eastern food is one of my favorites and Al Ryan is now a favorite restaurant in Lynchburg.\n  When I met the owner in August, 2014, I relayed my history with my Lebanese adopted family and asked if he made several dishes that I enjoyed, including hushwa.  Although he didn't offer Hushwa on his menu, he told me he would make it for me if I gave him a day's notice.  I took him up on his offer the next week and had a great meal!  \n  The owner is a great chef who also makes his own baklava; several varieties - pistachio filled, walnut filled, walnut filled with chocolate sauce.\n  The Turkish coffee flavored with crushed cardamom is excellent!\n  As the owner is Jordanian, he also offers their cuisine: I enjoyed the Jordanian Mansif on my last trip to Lynchburg in October, 2014.\n  The downstairs seating is very small (intimate) with only 3 tables but the restaurant has an upstairs area with a table for four and a traditional Jordanian area with seating on the floor with pillows and padded backrests.\n  No alcohol is served but the fruit juices are terrific!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-11-07T15:38:47-0500", "location_id": "4444554", "id": "238687884", "user": {"username": "kamikazekiddo", "user_location": {"name": "Sterling, Massachusetts", "id": "41848"}}}]}
