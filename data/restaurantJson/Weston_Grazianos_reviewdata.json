The bartender advised us to buy the bottle which she opened as it was cheaper than her serving a glass at a time. There was no corkage fee. We ordered fish and understood it was swordfish. It was not it was a fish comparable to tilapia.  \n\nSo now we go this year and want an Argentine beef steak which we ordered medium rare. We bought a bottle of Malbec to have at the restaurant with our meal. This was done at the cash register. We were charged a $10 corkage fee on a bottle of $19 wine. We were quite shocked but sucked it up to \"never again\"! Then we got our food, steaks ordered med. rare which were served medium well! We went back to the counter regarding the problem. The steaks were replaced with steaks that were rare to the point of being cold & literally raw. We asked for a to go box and took them back to our time share and cooked them to medium rare. We will never go back! We were just in Argentina and had wonderful food everywhere we ate although only 2% of all people in South America speak English. Apparently only 1 person at Graziano's speaks English so maybe our problem was partially language. If you do not speak fluent Spanish or like your steak well done or raw don't bother eating here! I guess I'm also ticked that I gave a $15 tip at the cash register. What was I thinking?
