Typical mexican food.  Prices reasonable.  there is a large salsa bar with many fixings to compliment your meal.  The chips were from store bought bags but still tasty.  I've had the warehouse type chips that seem to have been sitting around and are a bit putrid but these were pretty good.  They might have been more than your typical corn chip like maybe whole grain.  Ordered the lunch plate (even though it was 6 PM I could still get this) and a chile relleno plate.  The lunch plate was simple: beans(refried), rice, lettuce, guacamole,plus choice of meat (I had chicken).  The meat was ample and cut into small pieces.  Came with about 10 small (about 5\") tortilla shells so I was able to make several filling combos.  the chile relleno seemed overly moist and I think it may have been frozen then cooked as ordered.  I would return but probably not order the chile relleno again.  It was very busy with almost everyone getting food to go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-06-13T07:20:07-0400", "location_id": "575552", "id": "279921523", "user": {"username": "jserramcorder", "user_location": {"name": "san francisco", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-02", "title": "A hole in the wall Place with Excellent Burritos", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32278-d575552-r148834239-m11068-Los_Metates_I_I_I-Daly_City_California.html#review148834239", "text": "Muy Excelente!
