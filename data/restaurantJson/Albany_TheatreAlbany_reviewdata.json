But, alas, I am sad to say we are not inclined to return.  The actors are fine, the production is good (quite good actually), the sets are also quite good.  But, the choice of plays to present are the problem.  Outdated and not relevant or nostalgic.  It would be fun to see a familiar show done by local actors.  Or, a new modern production that is relevant to our times.  We get neither here.  Nun-sense was enjoyable, and fit what we were hoping to get.  But it stopped there.  We will keep our eyes on the place, but we will have to see something that gets us excided.  This is a gem for the town, and I truly hope that they are able to find a way to appeal to a larger segment of the population then current.

I found that the THEATRE ALBANY was in fact running a performance of \"Steel Magnolias\", also a favorite.  A quick call to the very friendly person in their box office, and we had reservations for the Sunday afternoon matinee, along with driving directions.  The tickets were surprisingly reasonable in price as well.\n\nOn arrival, we found the theater is housed in an enchanting old southern home, with a roomy auditorium, boasting tiered, comfortable seating and not a bad seat in the house.  The entire performance was professionally presented, the sound, staging etc. was perfect, and the acting was exceptional.  What talent is within this small community theater group !  We were told that they have been in operation for 80 years, and I can see why! They put their heart, soul, time and talents into offering up a quality performance to delight their audience.   If you have any opportunity to visit Albany, or to do as we did and \"side-trip\" through the town, check out their schedule.  They have a season of perhaps six shows, and each runs for a couple of weeks.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-09-02T12:02:55-0400", "location_id": "4786649", "id": "175320791", "user": {"username": "PCBeach4Me", "user_location": {"name": "Panama City Beach, Florida", "id": "34543"}}}]}
