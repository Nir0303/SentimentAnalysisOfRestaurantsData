A bit of history, the building is located in an old school cafeteria, you can still see the architectural remnants, which IMO adds to the atmosphere.  Staff are friendly and are constantly clearing tables.  The coffee BBQ sauce is my personal favorite.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-09-25T14:23:59-0400", "location_id": "6508188", "id": "422235689", "user": {"username": "The-Randall-Clan", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Not that great", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56432-d6508188-r422130084-m11068-Killen_s_Texas_Barbecue-Pearland_Texas.html#review422130084", "text": "Killens steakhouse restaurant is one of the best steaks I've ever eaten....hands down,  and I have eaten and some of the best steakhouses in the world.

I was impressed with the beer awaiting those that were...waiting in line. The small serving area only accomodates 2-3 people which, in turn, heightens the wait. This does not equal a good product. No lie, the BBQ was great, I would never want to diminish the quality of the product, but it seemed that they wanted the wait to create anticipation. That formula doesn't equate a good BBQ which was average at best. If you really want a great BBQ, go to Joe's just down I-35 in Alvin. There is no pretensious wait and they have GREAT product.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-12T21:47:37-0400", "location_id": "6508188", "id": "417775161", "user": {"username": "David K", "user_location": {"name": "Pearland, Texas", "id": "56432"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Best BBQ Period!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56432-d6508188-r417734454-m11068-Killen_s_Texas_Barbecue-Pearland_Texas.html#review417734454", "text": "2 min from my house, best BBQ in Houston for sure!
