However as much as I thought the breakfast was going to be tops, it was a let down, nothing special.  First the grits is the big test and to serve watery tasteless grits is really a letdown.  Girts isn't that hard, just cook them correctly, perhaps with a little cream or half n half and serve them fluffy, not soup.  As for the eggs the cook needs to learn how to cook eggs and by that I mean cook them.  I hate clear liquid running out of my eggs.  Over easy means whites done, yoke running. Sorry for being a little disappointed, our service was just fantastic and they cooked our eggs over and said if not right they would do them again.
