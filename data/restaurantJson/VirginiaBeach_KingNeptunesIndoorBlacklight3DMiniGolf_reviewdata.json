I can honestly said I did not see that coming. I have said NO to my kids wanting to come here for so many years that I caved in last week and said oh well. From the outside the place looks totally dive. That should have been a clue for me to check it out right?\n\nWe went in on a weekday morning with no other customers. I looked for coupons in Sunny Days, but found none. I knew it would be more than what it was worthy and found the $7 per head with no discounts for kids to be price for 10 holes of mini golf. The male attendant was very nice and friendly. The clubs, balls, score cards and pencils are given to you along with the most important items of all...3D glasses. \n\nSo on hole #1 we all put our glasses on and I must say it is pretty darn freaky and in spectacular kind of way. I would have never thought that it would be that cool, but it was. Everything just comes out at you and if you feel disoriented don't be surprised. The club even has paint on it giving it a 3D feel and strangely enough you can't even tell if your club is level. After we all did horrible on this hole we kicked them off to try our luck on #2 and did better. \n\nYour group can decide on, or off of the glasses. Either way these shore little holes offer challenge. We had a blast with them and never got a hole in one. The favorite hole of most is #9 and a must to keep the glasses on. You will swear your hitting the ball straight and it will roll all over the place on a slightly uneven floor...those stinkers! Allow around 30 min to play, or it could be longer I suppose when they are busy. \n\nThere is also a party table in the back where the restrooms are for groups. When back in the area I did hit up the restrooms and found them clean. As a matter of fact the whole place was clean with only one piece of debris on the course. \n\nSo why not a 5 after such a glowing review? The price is steep to me for around 25-30 min of play. Also, when asking the attendant about coupons he said they are around, but did not offer where. I found out just after walking out that the Monster book had $1 off coupons. It would have been easy for him to just say that, he did not have to supply us with them. Heck for a $3 saving I would have went around the corner and grabbed them. \n\nSomething to also consider is the amount of competition with mini golf that are larger and more reasonable. This is only one of two indoors, could be a pro if rain, con if nice day. Do a little research to find what best suit your family, or group. \n\nOverall I definitely recommend this place as a fun outing with friends, family and the kids.
