The food was a big disappointment: way too salty, too downscale, no fresh fruit, green salad leaves starting to go downhill (dark and slimy), sloppy potato salad heavy on the mayo (and I love mayo), no labels. Uninspired food with no special touches. Uninspiring presentation: no fresh flowers, no white table cloths. We were seated in a small eating area off the bar, while the dining room was closed and dark. This is Sunday brunch, folks!

Really, it deserves 2 Pegs but let me explain why I'm giving it 3 Pegs instead. First, the server and hostess were beyond engaging, fun, friendly, and knew the menu. They worked hard at being down to earth and genuinely seemed to care about my experience. Unfortunately, they need some help in the training of fine dining service, and the kitchen needs more than a little work. Let's start with the drinks. I was greeted and seated immediately but at a table that was a bit too close to a middle age couple just seated 15 seconds ahead of me and obviously celebrating an anniversary (I even heard his toast to their 17 years together -- nice job with the toast and God bless them on their anniversary).  Instead of accepting the seat very near (one foot) an intimate occasion, I asked for the next table over. No problem. I was given that table and that gave the Anniversary Couple a bit of space for their celebration without me seeming to listen to their life tales. A+ to the hostess for allowing me to give that couple their space. Back to the drinks ... I was in the mood for beer but, alas, the draft mechanism was out of order. Strike One. I ask what was in bottle or can but they didn't have a beer listing. Strike Two since the bar is attached the restaurant and you would think they would have a draft menu in print. The server departs for bread and Lady #2 appears and she explains they have Anchor Steam (excellent beer) and Harpoon UFO White, which just so happens to be my Go To Beer. So that is Plus 1 because Harpoon UFO is like God touching water. But then  Lady #2 says that she is a sommelier and they have some very nice wines and hands me the wine list. Eh, decent list. There was a Russian River pinot noir I had never heard of before and she began to describe it to me, saying it would match nicely with the Tomahawk Pork Chop I was considering (I assume server girl told her that is what I was asking about). So I get a prosecco starter and the Russian River pinot for the main course. Now let me say that everything the sommelier said about the wine was spot on, and I do mean spot on. It was a decent wine, one that would run $15 in a grocery store but means $45 for the restaurant price, or $9 a glass. Half way through the meal she came back and told me the winery is one of Zac Brown's associated enterprises --- didn't mean anymore or any less to me, but it was an interesting tidbit to know. The appetizer was the Peaches and Burrata Cheese, but I didn't particularly like it. Peaches were bland and the bread crumbs in the course were either very soggy or very stale -- nothing in between. The Tomahawk pork chop was a fine cut of meat that looked like, well, a tomahawk. Problem was I ordered medium and it came out well done. It was a top what I would describe as homemade fried potatoes like my Mom would cook growing up --- thin sliced potatoes placed in a frying pan with some oil, fried with =maybe= a bit of crisp. Not these potatoes. They were not done and still had the raw potato taste. A few slices were cooked properly but most were just barely a shade past raw. The asparagus was not completely cooked either, and still had that raw, rubbery texture. All that was Strike Three, with several foul balls before hand. But the pork chop was a good cut, though it was not marinated nor seasoned very well. When the server asked how I enjoying the meal, I told her about the potatoes and asparagus, and she graciously offered to bring me something else, thought I declined since the pork chop was large enough and decent enough to make a meal.  Now before you think I'm being nit picky, I'm not. But I'm still giving 3 Pegs because the place is beautiful and the people are so genuinely Southern Nice that I just can't give it the 2 Pegs it really deserved. But I'm not paying that much again for a meal that was not prepared properly. Servers were nice but not seriously trained in upscale service. Kitchen needs a lot of work. The piano / trumpeter were good -- relaxing.  Wait Staff = B minus. Sommelier =  B minus. Kitchen = C minus minus. Quality of meat = B minus. Atmosphere = B+. Wine selection = C. Beer selection = B minus. Not really a place for kids as this is a special occasion / date night / or adult gathering place. I'm hoping this was a bad night for the kitchen and not indicative of the place in total because this could be a great place to have an upscale dinner with top tier service and $$$ prices that I would be willing to pay ... if only.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Stacy P, Manager at P.I.

The shrimp and grits and roast beef were good...the staff was very curt with answers, and we had several encounters that showed they did not want to be there.  There were no plates for dessert which looked like pre-packaged choices. For $45/per person, we were expecting excellence.
