My wife ordered the hot dog meal and I ordered the pastrami grinder meal. It was a poor experience, and we will not be returning for the following reasons:\n\n1. The food was mediocre. My wife's hot dog was cooked ok (at least it wasn't cold!) with a toasted bun, but she was given the most laughably small portions of condiments I have ever seen.  She had asked for onions and relish, and the hot dog came out with less than half a teaspoon of relish, and two of the thinnest, saddest looking slivers of onion I have ever seen.  I could hardly contain myself from laughing at the look on her face. As for my pastrami grinder, it was OK, but nothing special.  Something I could whip up half asleep at 3 o'clock in the morning, and I am not a good cook (and we don't have any pastrami in the house).\n\n2. The price was high given the above quality.  Not sure if they are driving up the price to compensate for a lack of business, but we felt the price was excessive for the aforementioned quality issues.\n\n3. The wait was long. I don't know what they were doing to prepare the food, but it seriously took over 15 minutes, and we were the only people in the restaurant at the time.\n\n4. The workers didn't really seem to care.  They weren't rude or anything, but the vibe was definitely, \"please let this shift be over soon.\"  In addition, there were no paper towels stocked in the bathroom, and they ran out of napkins (we grabbed the last two).\n\nOverall, this review may seem a bit harsh, but they really are going to need to make some changes to survive.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-17T18:46:45-0400", "location_id": "863751", "id": "406845609", "user": {"username": "Jesse F", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Frozen Custard is Awesome!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57041-d863751-r382839061-m11068-Neilsen_s_Frozen_Custard-Layton_Davis_County_Utah.html#review382839061", "text": "I had never tried frozen custard before, but I had a coupon for a free cone.
