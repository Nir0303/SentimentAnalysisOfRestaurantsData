Fast and easy check in and the staff seemed very  nice. We were unaware this was an older hotel, but since we would only be there for one night I thought ok we will go ahead and stay here .     You enter your room from the outside and park your car in front of the door. There were two men who had pulled the chairs out of there room to smoke outside on the sidewalk, they looked like loiterers which made me feel uneasy.      Our  first room looked ok when we went in. We had problems though, when turning on the lamps,  three of the four lamps that provided light, wouldn't work.        Husband took the bulbs out of the lamps and moved them around to the other lamps and still no lights.    Hotel staff moved us to another room. The next room  looked ok, decent sheets but surely not a quality mattress. I walked over to the air conditioning unit to check the temperature and the carpet was soggy wet.  That did it for me, ready to leave ..We were here one hour from check in to check out.
