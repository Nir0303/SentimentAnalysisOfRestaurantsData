I walked over but there is on-street parking and valet parking from the downtown merchants.  Walked in, was immediately struck by the old-time vibe, a small dining romm that maybe holds 50 guests.  Shown to my table, service was instantaneous, wine list and menu provided as well.  Owner came by, welcomed us and recognized my guest as a previous patron, always a nice touch.  Warm bread was average, a bit of olive oil helped.  Specials we're read, my guest and I ordered salads first, my Caesar was excellent, her Arugula looked great, I'm not an Arugula fan so could not judge.   I ordered one of the specials, shrimp and Capellini with spinach and tomato, tossed in Olive oil.  It was excellent and a very large portion.  My guest ordered the Lobster Ravioli, since her plate was clean at the end I assume it was good.  She pronounced it fantastic!  No dessert, but two Coffee Americano''s ordere, the waiter cautioned us that it would take a moment as they brew fresh for each party.  It was indeed fresh and hot.
