Outdoor seating is pleasant but a little cramped just outside the front door.\n\nUpside of the menu: They seem to have something for everyone, most ages (kids, but not tinies), adventurous and not-so-much. Prices are a good value.\n\nParts of the menu are genuinely Greek (with the usual Turkish influence): mousaka, gyros, dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves), louganiko sausage, skordalia, tzatziki, saganaki, horiatiki (\u201cGreek Village Salad\u201d on the menu), souvlaki.\n\nSome dishes are adapted to the California mainstream (Mediterranean and Mexican), adding gyro meat, Greek olives, or feta to salads, pasta, and burgers for example, or topping entrees with \u201chouse Mediterranean salsa\u201d of tomato, onion, and sweet bell pepper.\n\nAnd some dishes are completely fresh-American mainstream, like chicken or tri-tip sandwiches, fries, and green salad.\n\nMy chicken reganati was a perfectly tender, tasty chicken breast, marinated and charbroiled, then topped with that \u201cmediterranean salsa\u201d and crumbled feta. The scoop of rice pilaf was flavorful but mushy. Side veggies of zucchini, onions, and green beans were perfectly cooked and seasoned, then combined for a variety of textures. Spouse\u2019s swordfish brochette/souvlaki was the same dish with a different protein and form factor.\n\nHigh marks:\n   - Basket of sliced, grilled bread before the entrees served with soft, composed garlic butter. I *loved* it! Spouse was less enthusiastic; woman at the next table seemed alarmed\n   - Really good feta \u2014 flavorful and moist, not just US mass-market\n   - Full bar, including ouzo and Greek brandy, plus Greek choices on the small wine list\n   - Cheerful, well-organized service, from entry to kitchen to table to check to exit\n\nBiggest conflict: Fresh galaktoboureko (yay!) with still-crispy top and delicious syrup had a filling that was more like sweet scrambled egg than custard. Too bad their otherwise great quality control didn't extend to dessert.
