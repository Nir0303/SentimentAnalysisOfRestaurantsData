(They do that every day.) I had a roasted chicken that had crispy skin and a juicy inside, with fingerling potatoes, a carrot pur\u00e9e with fresh baby carrots. Over the chicken was an incredibly delicious mushroom cream sauce with pearl onions and chives. \n\nIt all worked so beautifully and I kept saying over and over to my husband, \"It's just SO GOOD\".\n\nThe next night we both did a salad with salmon, but I added it to their wedge salad, iceberg, Blue cheese, cherry tomatoes and in the menu is says \"bacon\" which it certainly was but not what we usually get! They were like little bacon chunks, and just that small thing( the quality of the pork and how it was cut), made a fun difference. The ranch dressing was good.\n\nThe second night we tried 2 desserts: the chocolate mousse, and the salted, caramel apple tort with fresh whipped cream( whipped cream also on the mousse). I felt like mousse!! IT WAS FANTASTIC!! Not real sweet or too chocolatey, nice texture. Simple. Great.\n\nThe tort wasn't huge but every bite was quality. \n\nThe last night I had to have the chicken again (not very adventurous...), but my husband ordered the pasta Bolognese. It was a huge portion. Again, it was simple but delicious. At home he'd NEVER eat that much at one sitting.\n\nThe place is open, contemporary and doubles as a dance club on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nAsk for Drew.

The restaurant is a contemporary feel, casual but classy.  All employees we came in contact with were friendly and we felt like they liked their jobs.  Thank you Cody and Wes for your excellent service.  Food:  Not your usual bar menu.  KOL cares where their food comes from and is prepared and presented in amazing fashion.  A couple of our favorites:  Pig & Parmesan sandwich and Spinach Gorgonzola soup.  It is priced in mid-range and servings are generous.   However, they have fresh seafood flown in which is a little pricey, understandably.  We hear that to assure yourself of this seafood, you need to call and reserve as they were usually sold out by the time we dined.  \nOn some evenings they have entertainment such as dueling pianos.  This is a place where  younger and older generations come together and all seems to have a great time.  KOL is quickly climbing in the ratings and this is well deserved.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-26T07:04:28-0400", "location_id": "8058700", "id": "422474675", "user": {"username": "Rhonda L", "user_location": {"name": "Goshen, Indiana", "id": "37146"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Delightful menu for a special occasion", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54774-d8058700-r422257750-m11068-Kol-Rapid_City_South_Dakota.html#review422257750", "text": "The restaurant is beautiful and the menu is really fun. I tried the pork belly appetizer purely out of curiosity and it was a tasty treat and none of the connotations 'pork belly' conjure up for me proved to be real. The appetizer was tender and exceptionally tasty. Try it! I also loved the bison kabobs and the pizza someone at our table ordered (sorry but can't recall which it was.) \n\nThe staff went the extra mile for our birthday girls and the champagne complete with sparklers was festive. Because we chose to dine very late, things were a bit awkward as the restaurant transitions to a night club after ten, and the night club atmosphere was not our cup of tea, but we were delighted that we chose Kol and we will be back for lunch or dinner again soon. The staff, by the way, was fun, friendly and went out of their way to help make our special occasion very special.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-25T16:10:37-0400", "location_id": "8058700", "id": "422257750", "user": {"username": "Dusty P", "user_location": {"name": "hot springs, sd", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Great find", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54774-d8058700-r421619158-m11068-Kol-Rapid_City_South_Dakota.html#review421619158", "text": "We were surprised to find a restaurant of this quality in a relatively small city.
