I worked at the 3M campus from 2006 through 2014 and visited the Woodbury Starbucks quite often, 3 - 4 times per week. I have to have my caffeine kick. Over those years, you eventually become friends with the baristas and the manager, Irene. I became a regular of course. As soon as the baristas saw me drive up, they started making my special coffee drink: an Americano, 6 shots, Venti with room for cream.\n\nIt snows of course in Minnesota. I was caught in a December 2010 blizzard and had to park my car about 3/4 mile from my apartment. I began my trek home but the streets and sidewalks were all one. I expected a long, slow hike trudging through deep snow with more snow falling. A car pulled up beside me. It was Amy, one of the baristas, who recognized me! She gave me a much needed ride the rest of the way home. What a life saver! Later, I logged on to the Starbucks website and wrote a thank you to Amy through the Starbucks corporate comment link. \n\nSeveral months later, I asked Amy if she had received any compliments, pat on the back or or monetary reward from the Starbucks higher management for her efforts. Nada. So, I want you folks out there to know what Amy did (albeit several years later). She certainly deserves the recognition.\n\nFast forward to 2016. I was back in St. Paul for 3M meetings and stopped by the Starbucks at the Woodbury Plaza just last week. It was like old times - they remembered me and how to make my special drink! When you stop in, say hi to Irene and Amy. They will treat you like a king!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-18T16:33:11-0400", "location_id": "4111407", "id": "419969943", "user": {"username": "Don D", "user_location": {"name": "Florence, Oregon", "id": "51867"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great Coffee - slow drive thru", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43656-d4111407-r406661243-m11068-Starbucks-Woodbury_Minnesota.html#review406661243", "text": "Good Coffee but if you are going through the drive thru or even inside be prepared to wait especially in the morning.
