We often share a $2 pancake and coffee for breakfast and also their very good veggie burger for lunch, more than enough for the two of us. Just yesterday we asked our waiter, Jay AR, if we could have a skillet with the meat replaced by a veggie patty. He found out that it was possible and so we ordered  their skillet dinner which includes a salad, the skillet and piece of pie, all for only $8.99. We split each of the items and it was more than enough to satisfy us. Also, the new coffee blend was great, both the regular and the decaf. Our waiter was more than attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.
