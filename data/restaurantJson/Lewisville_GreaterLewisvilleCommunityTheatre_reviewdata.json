It's a tiny theater, and there is not a bad seat in the house.  The building is old but kept nice looking.  The lobby is also somewhat small, as is the box office room.  They have candy, soft drinks, beer (I think, not sure, I don't usually drink beer), and wine for a donation to their scholarship fund.  The productions?  How do they always find such good actors, singers, directors, musicians, set builders, and on and on and on.  Their plays are FANTASTIC.  We just attended the last play of this season, and I'm already looking forward to the next series of performances.  Bravo, GLCT!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-22T09:09:24-0400", "location_id": "8749475", "id": "395507139", "user": {"username": "clcann", "user_location": {"name": "Lewisville, Texas", "id": "56161"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Delightful Experience", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56161-d8749475-r331290174-m11068-Greater_Lewisville_Community_Theatre-Lewisville_Texas.html#review331290174", "text": "Wonderful venue to watch a \"live\" performance of dramas and musicals.

Furthermore, the restaurant has an agreement with nearby Tierney's restaurant where you can use your ticket stub to receive a two for one dinner offer.  My wife and I have season tickets, and so do many of our friends.  We have enjoyed so many fabulous productions without the hassle or cost of having to drive into Dallas or traverse the Fair Park Area.  The most recent production of \"Evita,\" was at a very high level with superb voices, dancing, and acting.  This theater loves to take on very challenging plays and does so with grace and finesse.  Moreover, one is never seated far away from the action.  Everyone is seated close to the action.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-21T00:54:16-0400", "location_id": "8749475", "id": "320575524", "user": {"username": "chuckbianco", "user_location": {"name": "Flower Mound, Texas", "id": "55844"}}}]}
