The buffet seems well supplied, and they offered a variety of subs. I had a steak sub, about 7.50 dollars, included chips and soda. The food was good but the service was terrible. Two stone face ladies who treated me as if my money wasn't good. I felt annoyed but with hunger, no point to focus on unfriendly faces. Will I go back?

It looks small from the street and it is down a few steps, but the food room is large as is the dining area.  I was very surprised by the variety. The salad bar was HUGE and the fruit was fresh and just right. You get a Styrofoam (yuck) container (2 or more sizes) or a Styrofoam plate and help yourself. Lunch is $6.29 per pound. I had roast turkey, sweet potatoes, cajun chicken, teriyaki chicken, a big biscuit, corn with carrot chunks. I wanted the roast beef, mashed potatoes/gravy but I was full after one plate. You van eat-in at formica tables, a whole room full. Drinks are fountain, with free soda refills, include the Coke and Pepsi families. The place was fairly busy at lunch time but two registers and busboys kept the line moving and tables clear. They also make some sandwiches to order. Location is on Calvert near Fayette across from the Court House/Post Office. They take credit cards but there is no Wifi.
