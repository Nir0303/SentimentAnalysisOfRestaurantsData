My niece is in town for the weekend from NYC.  We needed a place between our locals for breakfast today.  We agreed to meet in Lewisville.  My wife used Trip Advisor and settled on Tierney's Cafe and Tavern due to its high Trip Advisor rating.  We agreed to meet at 9:30 am.  Thankfully the weather was beautiful and waiting 30 minutes for the cafe to open (at 10 am) was pleasant.  Probably good anyway as the establishment was crowded with at least 6 groups lined up at the door for the opening.  We were seated right away and were told about the Sunday Buffet.  I viewed the offerings and was very impressed at the size and appetizing quality of the offerings.  I, however, prefer to be served meals and opted for the Californian Benedict off the menu.  My 3 dining companions chose the buffet.  All three agreed that the food was tasty and that for $14.95, a tremendous value.  My brother had 3 separate platefuls of food.  My wife had 2 and a desert offering.  I tasted the prime rib off her plate and it was excellent.  As for my Benedict, it was very slow to arrive, but I didn't mind.  It was adequate (good but I've had better at other places in the past).  My wife's comment was that the buffet did not have signs/labels of the offerings which would have been nice but she enjoyed.  My brother, who eats every meal at a restaurant (I know that is crazy), said, he will include this place on his list of establishments to return to again and again.  I would gladly eat there again if in the area.  I give this place the best rating of 5 circles!  Very good breakfast food and excellent value.
