We had cheeseburgers and one had a grilled chicken. It is a nice family restaurant that has good service and prices. The hours at 6-3 everyday. The parking is on the street or a lot across or parking garage behind the restaurant. We found an open spot on the street but would say the lot or garage would be easier. The place is clean and overall everything was good.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-08-10T11:04:24-0400", "location_id": "4627162", "id": "171632009", "user": {"username": "25Bud", "user_location": {"name": "Lombard", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "ja", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "\u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u8c4a\u5bcc\u306a\u99c5\u524d\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29277-d4627162-r251093785-m11068-Village_Grill_of_Arlington-Arlington_Heights_Illinois.html#review251093785", "text": "\u30a2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30f3\u30cf\u30a4\u30c4\u99c5\u524d\u3001US14\u6cbf\u3044\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3001\u3068\u3066\u3082\u30d5\u30ec\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30fc\u306a\u304a\u5e97\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u306a\u7a2e\u985e\u306e\u6599\u7406\u304c\u305d\u308d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u63a7\u3048\u3081\u306a\u5065\u5eb7\u30e1\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u660e\u308b\u3044\u5e97\u5185\u3067\u3001\u30e1\u30c8\u30e9\u306e\u5217\u8eca\u3092\u898b\u306a\u304c\u3089\u98df\u4e8b\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-26T06:07:02-0500", "location_id": "4627162", "id": "251093785", "user": {"username": "\u4e0d\u7cbe\u65c5\u884c\u4eba", "user_location": {"name": "\u4e2d\u90e8", "id": null}}}]}
