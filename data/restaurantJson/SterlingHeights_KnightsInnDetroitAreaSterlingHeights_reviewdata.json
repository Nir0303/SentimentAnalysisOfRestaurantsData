We were surprised to find both a refrigerator and microwave. The size of the appliances allowed us to store not only our leftover Chili's takeout container, but also a mini tub of guacamole and salsa. Although we didn't use it, the bathroom featured a bottle opener mounted on the wall next to the toilet, giving a new meaning to the phrase \"out with the old, in with the new.\" Don't be deterred by the continental breakfast. Even though the idea of a continental breakfast boasts on an abundance of variety, we were only offered blueberry muffins and weak coffee, but it is important to note that the muffins were magnificent. Crumbly and sweet with a slight tang from the blueberry chunks, I dare say it was the second best thing I placed in my mouth that morning.

They were not much help at all. I did not ask for any reimbursement or stay vochures but they acted like it was no big deal. When I mentioned that I will NEVER stay at another Knights Inn anywhere.
