You get a large piece of quiche (almost like a frittata just not as dense) and a nice green salad.  It is enough to fill you up for sure and really the 'go to' item on the menu.\n\n2.  Any salad on the menu is great!-Honestly, this is what I go here for (aside from the quiche).  They are fresh and made how you like it.  \n\nStay away from their baked goods.  They are NOT yummy or worth the calories...and I love dessert...they just disappoint.\n\nMy last comment is really about the staff.  They are not super friendly.  I'm sure others will disagree but they just aren't.  At times I actually feel like I'm bothering them.  Just the truth.  \n\nRoll the dice and see what you get.

So I was very thrilled when  a friend asked me to meet her here for lunch. The food is always very good and service is excellent. It's small and popular so if you want lunch here you need to go early. Enjoy the patio or inside.

It's one of my favorite lunch spots.
