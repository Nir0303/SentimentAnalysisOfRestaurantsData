Chairs scraping the floors was hard on the ears.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich is accompanied by cole slaw and chips. Not being a cole slaw fan I specified \"no cole slaw\", no substitute was suggested or offered. \n\nWhen you swipe your credit card the screen has a tip chart. Usually I leave a tip based on service which at that point the service was no different from going to a fast good place and paying at the register. It seemed odd to prepay a tip for nothing different from any fast food joint.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich. My colleague ordered an open face melted cheese over ham sandwich. Her sandwich had no sides.\n\nThe pork on my sandwich had a fair amount of fat and gristle. When I shred my meats I remove the fat and gristle so ended up making a mess of my sandwich as I removed the fat and gristle because it gags me to bite into the gristle. The pork was very tender, the bread was toasted on one side yet very soft and chewy inside. The sandwich was very dry without any condiments. In retrospect the menu simply said pulled pork, I should not have expected a little bar-b-que sauce. I was not alone in expecting some sort of moisture as my colleague looked at the sandwich and commented \"shouldn't you have some kind of sauce?\"\n\nAs they give you a number then drop off your order, just like any fast food place, no one checks back to ask if anything else is needed or if all is fine. In hindsight I could have gone to the register to ask for some kind of condiment, I was just so surprised and we were in a hurry to finish seeing our accounts after waiting a while to receive our meals I didn't think to ask if there might be something I could have added to the sandwich.\n\nThe chips were stale.\n\nMy sandwich was $12.51 including the prepaid tip. It seemed expensive for stale chips and a dry sandwich.\n\nMy colleague didn't comment on her sandwich.\n\nI saw someone with a salad that looked scrumptious.

This venue is somewhat reminiscent of Starbucks.  Many patrons were working online while grabbing a bite to eat.  \n\nI found a gluten free peanut butter cookie.  I also ordered some ice cream made in store.  I ordered the salted Carmel with some chocolate.  The chocolate was firm and tasted superb.  The taste of the Carmel was as you would expect, but is had softened so much that its texture left me wishing it was as hard as the chocolate.  The cookie was not my favorite, but that likely was due to the gluten free nature.  \n\nThe cabinets were full of baked goods all of which were very tempting.
