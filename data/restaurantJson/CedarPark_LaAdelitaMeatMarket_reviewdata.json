This place is a small Mexican meat market and Taqueria w/ salsa bar.  They have a counter with display case to order your food then you take your order the market cash register to pay.  I usually take my order to go, but there is also a small seating area where you can sit and eat.  This place is certainly not fancy, but if you are look for authentic Mexican food you will find it here.  \n\nIf you are ever in the area stop here to have yourself a real treat.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-21T10:38:47-0400", "location_id": "10218476", "id": "366124865", "user": {"username": "DannyMac13", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}]}
