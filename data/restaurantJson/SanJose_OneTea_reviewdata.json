They've got drinks like grass jelly with red bean, matcha with matcha pearls (yes, matcha-boba!), a milk pudding taro mango dessert that is to die for, and so much more. You can also customize most of the drinks for Sweetness, Ice Level, and Milkiness -- a great feature to any good boba/pearl milk tea shop.\n\nService was friendly and nice, and very helpful. \n\nPro tip: follow them on Instagram or Facebook to get the daily secret code for 10% off your entire order!\n\nStreet meter parking available nearby.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-27T03:22:30-0400", "location_id": "11748940", "id": "432079812", "user": {"username": "lilicedt", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}]}
