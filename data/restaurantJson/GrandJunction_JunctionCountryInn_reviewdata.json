The beds were hard and you could feel the springs poking through the mattress. The doors were cracked and our bathroom door wouldn't close all the way.

The carpets were very old and not vacummed. The bathroom floor hadn't been mopped. There was hair and dirt all along the walls. There was a dead bird in the dining room. As for safety, the heat lamp on the bathroom ceiling didn't have a cover and was very outdated. In one of the rooms it wouldn't turn off. In another room the smoke detector fell off the wall, him someone in the head and had no batteries or connection to the wall. The railings outside were very loose and the metal stairway was cracked, leaning and very wet!! There were three teams staying there and I know none of them will ever stay there again.
