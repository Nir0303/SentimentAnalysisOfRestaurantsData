While I suppose it is convenient that this tasting room is in downtown Santa Barbara, it was not an enjoyable experience.  We headed in on a Friday afternoon.  The bar was occupied, so we were told to sit at the side table.  It was covered in boxes of wine and publications; we clear some space at the end.  While we were welcomed when we came in, after sitting down, it took a long time for the staff to acknowledge our presence and begin the tasting (this did not stop them from seeking gratuity at the end of the experience).  The tasting itself them took forever; our server was clearly more interested in a couple she knew at the bar.  When she finally did come to pour the next glass, she basically told us what it was and then walked away--little description as to what to expect and zero interest in what we thought.\n\nHere's what we thought:  bad wine, at least compared to most of the other things we tried in the St. Inez Valley.

It was only after we walked out and I thought about it that I realized the way they had set up the payment process, they made me tip on the carry-away purchase!!
