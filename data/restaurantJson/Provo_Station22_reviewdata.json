We went at lunchtime and had a small wait but it was so fun to see what everyone else was ordering.  They have a wide variety of burgers, sandwiches, seafood baskets, delicious beer battered fries with a delicious sauce for dipping and a HUGE selection of originally crafted sodas.   Our son had the Golden State Burger.  I had the 22 Club Sandwich on Ciabatta Bread.  My husband got the Honest Abe Burger.  So DELICIOUS.  It was  a great choice.  I would definitely go there again.  Mid price range.  We were very happy we tried it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-24T15:34:24-0400", "location_id": "2046567", "id": "376258661", "user": {"username": "Delainie A", "user_location": {"name": "Utah", "id": "28965"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Burger was good Shrimp dish not so much....", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57106-d2046567-r375231909-m11068-Station_22-Provo_Utah.html#review375231909", "text": "The craft soda selection is very good as folks say.  We stopped in for dinner and had to wait about an hour to be seated (so the place was definitely in demand).  My husband ordered a burger which was quite good.  My son and I ordered a shrimp special with grit cakes and a sauce.  The grit cakes were good.  The sauce was interesting... sort of a hot/sweet/sour sauce.  The sauce was not bad persay but I would not seek it out again.  Unfortunately my plate was literally swimming in the sauce.  Swimming as in when the waiter put down the plate the sauce was in danger of slopping off my plate.  It really looked like I ordered soup with some shrimp on top.  For us the service was also very slow - we had to keep flagging our waiter down.  I would not go out of my way to come back here but if I did go back I would definitely get a burger instead.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-21T14:03:52-0400", "location_id": "2046567", "id": "375231909", "user": {"username": "nametaken5", "user_location": {"name": "Orinda, California", "id": "32831"}}}]}
