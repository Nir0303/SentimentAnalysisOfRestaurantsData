We ordered the beer pretzels with a spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, I ordered a chicken bacon swiss (no bacon) with fries and Matt ordered the Konrad's Club.\nThe Pretzels (served hot) were FULL of salt - don't get me wrong - we like salty pretzels but this was way over the top. They were also so very greasy they felt like they would literally slip out of your hands. The dip seemed seemed nothing more than a melted stick of butter with a bit of spinach and cheese flavor. The fries were coated heavy with a seasoned salt. The sandwiches were just average - not enough to save this meal for us. \nIt was so greasy and heavy we both were burping our meals hours later. \nThe service and ambiance alone can't make a meal or a good review - after all - we were there for a good meal, and that fell short to put it lightly.\nSave this place for a night out for some drinks and maybe an appetizer when the visit hinges less on the food quality and more on the socializing, entertainment and booze.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "KonradsLS, Owner at Konrad&#39;s Kitchen and Tap House, responded to this review", "text": "We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback.
