The food was outstanding. Overall the dinners were good, but there were some issues.  I had the Hickory Smoked and Fried Colman Farms Chicken. I was not impressed with the chicken being bone-in. In an upscale restaurant such as this, you do not pick up your chicken and eat it with your hands. Yet, while others at our table were given sharper steak knives to cut their meals, I was not. I only had a standard butter knife that comes with the rolled silverware from the start. Cutting fried chicken off the bone with a butter knife is not very easy or practical. In an upscale restaurant you expect the waiter to anticipate these kinds of things and provide you with the proper utensils. Additionally, my meal was the most reasonably priced of the eight dinners at the table for the portion size received. It was $23 and it came with three medium sized pieces of chicken.
