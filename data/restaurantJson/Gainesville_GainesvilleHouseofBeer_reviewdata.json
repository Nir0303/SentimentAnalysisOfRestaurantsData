I was happy as the House of Beer has bar stools with backs as I knew I would be held hostage there by my hubbie for a while.  Try this place out if you are a beer lover as the employees really know their beers plus are very intelligent conversationalists. Oh and I had cider one day and wine the next so other drinks available as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-12-01T03:38:17-0500", "location_id": "2323012", "id": "121281832", "user": {"username": "sweetgrits1950", "user_location": {"name": "Central FL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2011-09", "title": "Well-stocked addition to Gainesville's Burgeoning Craft Beer Scene", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34242-d2323012-r119224415-m11068-Gainesville_House_of_Beer-Gainesville_Florida.html#review119224415", "text": "This is a bar, not a restaurant - no food. As a craft beer enthusiast, I had been waiting for the opening of Gainesville House of Beer for months (you can follow them on Twitter and Facebook). When we visited in September, they had only been open a few weeks. While the decor leaves something to be desired (as in, there IS NO decor, save a couple beer signs and flat screen TVs), you're not really there for the ambience, are you? No, you're there for the beer, and they've got plenty of it. Mostly draft, they rotate kegs very often, meaning there will be something new to try every time you visit. The selection has great variation - lagers, a couple stouts, some pumpkin beers (so tasty), and styles of beer of which many people have a only a passing knowledge. The service was super-friendly, and they seem to make an effort to show their appreciation for customers. They have a Rail Club, where after drinking several styles of beer (and marking it on a card they give you), you can get free drafts and other goodies. Hmm, trying to think of a critique... I was surprised by the carpet - you wouldn't think that would be a good idea in a bar, and it's very institutional-looking. But that won't stop me from returning, and often!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2011-10-12T08:00:15-0400", "location_id": "2323012", "id": "119224415", "user": {"username": "gonoles95", "user_location": {"name": "Gainesville, Florida", "id": "34242"}}}]}
