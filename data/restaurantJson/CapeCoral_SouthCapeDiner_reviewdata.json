The Diner, which routinely served breakfast and lunch, just recently began serving dinner. I ordered fish and chips off the dinner menu. My meal was served hot with a nice bunch of grilled asparagus. It all looked promising until I realized that only one small piece of fish on my plate appeared to look like the Cod I ordered and the the other two looked like fish sticks from the grocery store freezer. As I dug in, my concerns were validated. I was very disappointed. The fish stick triangle shaped pieces were flavorless and over cooked; however the small Cod piece was decent and was clearly not the same type of fish as the other pieces. This was my first visit to the diner, so to be fair I will try it again - but not for dinner. I think they may need a little more time to perfect their dinner menu offerings. The next time I will try breakfast.

There was one couple eating outside and two other couples inside. I picked my booth and sat as another couple sat in the same section.

The rest of the meal included the same attentive service. \n     Now the food. Solid, basic breakfast no frills and plenty of food. Coffee was standard diner fare with plenty of refills. I ordered the Country Scrambler with home fries and a biscuit of gravy. More food than I anticipated but I finished it. Home fries were a touch under seasoned (it may be due to the population requesting 'low salt') but cooked well. The biscuit was ok and I enjoyed the white gravy with it's bite of black pepper. \n     On the down side...too much cheese, orange juice did not give me the \"Florida Feel\" and the sounds from devices were an odd mix.
