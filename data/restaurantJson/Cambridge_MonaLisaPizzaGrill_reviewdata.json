They were sick of the hospital food so I got lunch and brought it back. The place was very busy! Of course it was 12:15 right at lunch time. They took my order quickly, I paid and then I waited. They have a big screed t.v. so I didn't even notice how long I waited because I was distracted by the news. They got my attention when the food was ready and I brought it back to the room.\nI got the Stuffed shells and meatballs and my friend got a hot pastrami sub! Mine was good but one of the shells was crisp at one end and slightly dried out. They probably reheated it for too long! The meatballs were out of this world! The sub my friend had was terrific except they only sell large subs but when they put the meat in the bread they don't spread it out so you get one end that is empty!
