It did and we jumped on the reservation.\n\nFair warning, SF is an expensive place to eat and this is high end food.  The atmosphere is bright and casual, but the prices are high, as to be expected, especially with seafood.\n\nThe food was excellent.  Trout tostadas were similar to the tuna version offered in DF and delicious.  The halibut ceviche with fennel and radish was delicate and tasty.\n\nWe heard a lot about the sweet potato and it was delicious.  It's a simple preparation - just a charred whole sweet potato, but the charred exterior lends a nice smokiness to the creamy interior.  It arrives with a bone marrow salsa negro which is just the right combination of spice and fat spread on a tortilla under the sweet potato. Yum!\n\nWe also shared the rockfish (for 2).  It was whole, butterflied and roasted then topped, divorciados-style, with a green salsa over one side and a red on the other.  It was mild but flavorful.\n\nOverall the dishes were very flavorful with much less chile heat than we expected (or would have preferred.)\n\nThere is an extensive mezcal and tequila list with many top shelf, boutique options.  The mezcals were pricey and offered in two size pours.  Be clear on preferences.  My dinner partner assumed he has a small pour instead receiving the large, which we didnt figure out until the bill came.\n\nService needs some work.  Our server was lovely and well informed but the bar was quite slow in sending out drinks and our finished plates were left on the table long after they were empty resulting in an awkward dance when new food arrived with no room at the table.

Impeccable service, we ordered 6 dishes and they paced the timing perfectly.  All the ingredients were fresh and the presentations were beautiful.  We had the trout tostadas which were served on top of a spicy chipotle sauce with avocado and topped with fried leeks.  Four tostadas with very generous toppings.  The squid and trout frito mixto was lightly breaded and very crisp, not soggy as frito mixtos sometimes are.  Another excellent choice was the grilled little gems.  They were served with corn tortillas and red beans.  The little gems had a slightly tart dressing which counter balanced nicely with the beans.  This dish could be a vegetarian main course.  Nice wine list with options of 1/2 and full carafes.  Very extensive mescal and tequila list.
