We typically go there about 6 times a year for celebrations - birthdays, graduations, new jobs, promotions, etc.  Almost always have very good experiences.  Food from the Teppan Grill always fresh and tasty.  Steak, chicken, lobster always fresh, cooked to order.  I do have one minor complaint.  Normally we go with 6-8 people so we drop well over $200 per visit.  Last time we were there, one in our party asked for an additional bowl of steamed rice.  No problem, they brought it very promptly.  When I got the bill, they charged us $1.50 for the extra rice.  Really?  Between drinks, apps, dinner, etc. we spend close to $250 and they charge us $1.50 for a nickel's worth of rice?  Thought that was pretty cheap of them.  Because of that, the next party we had, we went to Spaghetti Factory.  So that $1.50 cost THEM over $200.  It didn't stop of from coming back, but it did cost them.  Service is generally good but the \"show\" is getting a little tired - \"butter fly\" Choo Choo train, egg roll........ time to come up with new material.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience. My friend only goes there for the sushi, so if I go back I'll stick to their sushi bar and sample more salmon!! Four Claws UP!!!! Peace Out! Joe G.

You have a choice of going to the left side of the restaurant which is teppan-style which is like benihana.  They cook right in front of you on a flat grill.  The chefs are very entertaining and best in a group.  The right side of the restaurant is more like a Japanese restaurant/sushi bar.  The sushi here is always fresh and they are generous.  I hate places that give you small pieces of fish...not here.  They also have an all you can eat sushi menu for lunch and dinner....well worth the price.  They even have a special room in the back for groups and special events.  This place is also very kid friendly - they give the kiddies a lollipop on a long stick....Very nice!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-01-12T06:25:56-0500", "location_id": "887635", "id": "190605678", "user": {"username": "Cooking_Hawaiian", "user_location": {"name": "Hawaii", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-12", "title": "Awesome food, great price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32248-d887635-r186597153-m11068-Sgc_Japanese_Restaurant-Corona_California.html#review186597153", "text": "I was in Corona on business and decided to try this place.
