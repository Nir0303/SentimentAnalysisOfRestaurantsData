It was fabulous! \n\nThis is a family owned business, and they've been in location for only 3 or so weeks.  They are located two blocks east of the main grouping of food trucks - which means parking is easier here! \n\nFamily members are from Venezuela, and speak very little English - but are good with the menu and pantomime. We started with a fresh grilled chicken sandwich (#7) with fresh avocado. They have a great sauce to pour on the top and it was yummy! \n\nAn English speaking woman came to greet us once we were sitting and asked if we had any questions. She recommended the larger \"meal in a bun\" sandwich - the #14 Cabimera - beef, cheese, friend plantains, sauce - she brought one over to the table and the 3 of us passed it between us - continually exclaiming how good it was. \n\nWe all really like friend plantains, so she brought us some extra of those. Fabulous! \n\nWe don't live in the valley, or I'd be driving by there once a week to pick up a cabimera w/ extra plantains for dinner to take home. \n\nIt's worth the drive and stop.  There are tables and chairs next to the food truck for those who want to eat \"on site\" - they also package for to go orders.  See pictures to recognize the truck.  Very friendly and kind people.  Very fresh, tasty food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-07T12:00:23-0400", "location_id": "10816276", "id": "415864100", "user": {"username": "africanaddict", "user_location": {"name": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "id": "312578"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Our favorite food truck in McAllen!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56255-d10816276-r414657920-m11068-Que_Chevere_Venezuelan_Cuisine-McAllen_Texas.html#review414657920", "text": "We stopped by Que Chevere! on a Friday night before the McAllen art crawl started. What a pleasant surprise. We tried two different sandwiches - the pollo mecado (#7) with avocado, and the cabimera (#14) - meat, cheese, fried plantains, with a yummy sauce in a tasty bread pocket.  We are great lovers of fried plantains - so we ordered a few extra of those - which we practically licked the plate clean. \n\nWe sadly don't speak Spanish, and the family owning/working in Que Chevere! only speak broken English - but we managed. \n\nWe LOVED the food - it all tasted very fresh and flavorful. Nothing mediocre or middle of the road. If I lived down here, I think this truck is the kind of place I'd stop by once a week on my way home. And while I'm at it, I'd learn a bit more about the Venezuelan food.
