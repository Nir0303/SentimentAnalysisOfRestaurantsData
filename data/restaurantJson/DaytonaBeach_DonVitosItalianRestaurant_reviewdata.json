Yes, there can be a delay checking folks out dependent upon crowds. As far as the pizza and spaghetti are concerned we are bewildered? Reviews ahead and after yours speak of the SAME items and are ALL positive?  ALL our pasta are cooked al dente, [firm to the bite]. Admittedly you did wait awhile for your items for which we can only apologize. We have found that a long wait can severely impact a reviewers comments and some times distort them??  This may be at least part of the case with your visit. You also had some Steak Pinwheels which you took home but, failed to mention. I assume you enjoyed those?? Those are made with the SAME homemade dough and SAME fresh steak as the Pizza you had??? Here's the bottom line. WE apologize for the delay but, as we have stated so many times, if you're not willing to wait, or if your looking for fancy we are not for you. The wait is dictated by the crowds and the fact that EVERYTHING is cooked fresh. Wait times will vary greatly. While we too are deeply saddened by your declaration to NOT return, somehow we will find the courage to persevere and go on!! We too thought we had garnered a great customer??
