They have a LOT of choices. Bear claws, donuts, strudel, bread, cupcakes, pies, rolls, brownies, cookies...just about any baked good you can think of, and the prices were AMAZING!  We just had donuts, because I simply couldn't decide.  They were just ok, but we'll definitely come back and try more goodies each and every time we are in the area.
