Small town atmosphere with great home cooked style food.  Nothing fancy but always good.  Plus they have the added bonus of some great Greek food including gyros and baklava.  And their Greek salad can't be beat.  Great place for taking the family when you don't feel like cooking and the prices are very reason.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-13T19:51:09-0400", "location_id": "855687", "id": "299029058", "user": {"username": "Charlene S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Good Local Cafe", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43242-d855687-r249888266-m11068-Buckboard-Lakeville_Minnesota.html#review249888266", "text": "We stopped by for lunch around noon and were told of limited menu.
