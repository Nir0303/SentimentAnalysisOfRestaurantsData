It's a small building so there's only so much art to view. However, we enjoyed the brief visit. It would have been nice to have more information about the art displayed--from a pamphlet or a docent, perhaps.  We'd return though if we heard about an interesting exhibit again. It's pay-what-you-want, and it's local--for us, a good value and a good opportunity to appreciate art.

The young 20 something girl asked  us why we parked there and I just looked at her because I didn't know what to say. She said that's not a parking place. use the street. So I moved my car out of the driveway and into the street. She then told us real curtly that there was no fee to just look around and watch out because the pictures sometimes fall off the wall.\nok. I'm all about freedom of speech, religion, whatever because this is America, but The first thing I see is a confessional set up ,I look inside and the \"priest\" is a skeleton.. The second thing I see is a Bible on the wall upside down with something stabbed through the middle. Needless to say I left.  man.......wow. that's all I can say. no wonder she was so rude she lives in that place all day", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-12-06T14:37:01-0500", "location_id": "7302733", "id": "243254405", "user": {"username": "TexaxGranny", "user_location": {"name": "Texas", "id": "28964"}}}]}
