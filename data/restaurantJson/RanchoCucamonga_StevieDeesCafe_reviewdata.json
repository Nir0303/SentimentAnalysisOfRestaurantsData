My favorite night to go there is Tuesday when the full size tacos (not the street taco size) are only $.99.  You have the choice of ground beef, carne asada, or chicken and all are good.  The tacos have enough overflow of lettuce, salsa, and cheese that you have a mini side salad left over.  Try Taco Tuesday for the best bargain on tacos in town.  The homemade soups are great with chicken noodle, vegetable beef, and clam chowder leading the list.  Seniors can order dinners as a senior portion which is still a good sized meal.  My wife and I have shared a senior portion and not gone away hungry.  Most of the time you will also get a desert included - strawberry shortcake, chocolate cake, or another kind of cake with whipped cream on top.  Breakfasts are varied and plentiful.  The 'Special' for about 4 bucks is 2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, homefries, and bread or english muffin or biscuits and gravy (good gravy!).  Large waffles with/without fruit and lots of whipped cream.  The ham and egg breakfast sandwich is a favorite of mine and the large burritos also make a satisfying meal.

With Stevie Dee's Cafe (their new location at Foothill and Archibald), they've continued on with their good food and great prices from the Vineyard and 8th St. location. This is comfort food, pure and simple. Food that is probably made from recipes from the 50s and 60s. It's not extraordinary food, just what us \"mature\" people remember as \"real food.\" Nothing fancy, just tasty with great prices. There are nightly specials, and seniors can order a meal for $4.99. Coffee is only 99c a cup, with free refills whenever they are open. Service was great, \"fast\", and I'm sure most of everything is cooked when ordered. The 1/2 fried chicken came in very tasty, and even the breast piece was juicy. The all-you-can-eat fish and chips on Friday evening filled me up with a single serving. The fried fish fillets (4) were of sufficient size that it was \"all I could eat!\" An added surprise was a very good strawberry shortcake? dessert. The strawberries were fresh cut with a bit of juice, not what one normally gets where the strawberries are in a red sludge. The shortcake/biscuit or whatever was what I remember from 'way back when, when things were made from scratch. And I am almost sure the whipped cream topping was the real thing. I've enjoyed their location on Vineyard for years, and certainly will continue to enjoy their new location.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-10-20T20:15:05-0400", "location_id": "3567512", "id": "143322945", "user": {"username": "GreggL14", "user_location": {"name": "Helendale, California", "id": "32484"}}}]}
