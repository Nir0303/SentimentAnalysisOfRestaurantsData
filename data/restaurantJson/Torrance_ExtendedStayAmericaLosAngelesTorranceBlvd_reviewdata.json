More on that later. When I arrived, I was told I would have a room on the smoking floor, though I requested a non-smoking room. I asked if this was just for the night & was told it was for my entire stay. A little miffed, but not upset as I've stayed in smoking rooms before with no issues. Can't say that ever again. I could smell the smoke before I got off the elevator. OMGosh it was strong and only got worse when I entered the room. The smell was everywhere - in the room, bathroom, furniture, sheets, EVERYTHING! I went back to reception and begged for another room. They said they were fully booked, but offered me a candle (which is illegal I believe) to dull the scent. It didn't work. Now about the fully-equipped kitchen. How surprised was I when I looked in the cupboard to find it bare. No plates, utensils, pots/pans, dish towels. Nothing. Very disappointed. If in the area and looking for a place to stay for the night - drive pass this hotel and keep looking. Not worth a penny of your money.
