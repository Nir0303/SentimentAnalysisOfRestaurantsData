I liked the place because of this AND the fact that they were giving it a go at running their own store.  \n\nVery nice, friendly service, good coffee. Asked for and was given half-and-half for my coffee. I use a slug to cool the coffee off; purists might argue that this turned my drink into a latte, but, geeze, I don't use that much.  The cappucino was still rich with coffee. \n\nAs I said above, it is new, so it is still pretty bare-bones coffee-machine-wise, furnishing-wise and decor wise.
