I ordered the carne guisada plate.  It took a while for my food to arrive. When it finally arrived my plate looked terrible. There were about 8 small pieces of meat on the plate. I mentioned to the server if this was normal and after looking at the plate she stated she would bring me some additional meat. Well as I started to eat the carne guisada which was not very tasty and lacked seasoning. The beans were not fresh; they were probably old beans that were a little sour. The rice didn't have any flavor either and they threw some lettuce and a little tomato on the plate to make it look full. Anyway, our server never came back to bring me the extra carne guisada, to refill our drinks or to see how we were doing. When I went to pay my tab at the register, I mentioned my complete displeasure to the lady and explained what had happened. She didn't seem to care one iota. After I saw her reaction and demeanor I mentioned to her that I would not be coming back and she didn't even blink. I can't see this establishment lasting too much longer if this continues.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-11T06:24:50-0500", "location_id": "7933059", "id": "436376394", "user": {"username": "Edward D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "It's ok", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55786-d7933059-r431498151-m11068-My_Place_Cafe-Edinburg_Texas.html#review431498151", "text": "Their lunch specials are good.

I understand that it's the lunch rush hour, but no need to rush the food either. That is how you end up messing up the food and orders. I would recommend you try it once.
