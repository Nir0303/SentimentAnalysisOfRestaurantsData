When I walked in, my first impression was that they had done a pretty nice job with the space.  Not nearly as open as what it was when it was the previous establishment, but 4 Barrel has different cooking requirements and is shooting for a different atmosphere.  I felt a bit closed in, but all in all, they did a good job.\n\nThey have some interesting dishes on the menu which are not common such as smoked eggs and deep fried Oreos.  Both sound very interesting, but given this was the first visit, I just wanted to judge the BBQ.\n\nI had pulled pork and the Jalapeno Brat along with beans and a side salad.  Let me take each individually:\n\n* Pulled pork: Good taste, cooked perfectly, but was a bit fatty.  I had 4 chunks of fat in my serving.  Not huge, but shouldn't have been there.  The person I went with also had some fat in her pulled pork sandwich.  Strange, but nonetheless, the pork had a good flavor.\n\n* Jalapeno brat: Quite good.  Cooked perfectly.  I'd have liked it to have a lot more heat, but it was tasty as a mild jalapeno brat.\n\n* Beans: This is where things weren't quite as expected.  The beans tasted good, but didn't look good.  They were served in a metal tin, which was interesting, but the tin was so large that it looked like a miniscule amount of beans, even though it was a very reasonable portion.  In addition, they were just a flat brown.  There was no variation in color to them.  Think about refried beans, not in consistency, but in color.  That was these.  They need to add in some small chunks of bacon or pork or peppers/onions or something to give the consistency and color some variation.  Just an opinion.  Like I said, they tasted decent.\n\n* Side salad: Flat out bad.  The lettuce was so wilted it was terrible.  It should never have been served.  Perhaps the owner may reply to this review and ask why I didn't bring it up to our server.  First, it should have been obvious to the kitchen.  No excuse.  Second, well, I'll to that in \"service\" below.\n\nOverall, salad aside, the food was good and reasonably priced.  Good enough that I'll give it another try.  I think a few small refinements (get the fat out of the pork, add some color/consistency to the baked beans, and don't serve wilted lettuce) will go a long way.\n\nService:  Our waitress was prompt in getting to us and had recommendations available.  (I like a server with an opinion.  When they say, \"It's all good\", it usually isn't.)  She was friendly and the orders came out promptly and correct.  She also took our plates promptly when we finished and asked if we wanted anything else.  She brought and took care of the check quickly.  The only slip up, and reason #2 why I didn't complain about the salad, was that after the food came out, she came over very quickly to ask how everything was.  I hadn't yet had a bite.  I told her that and that I would tell her in a few minutes, but she never came back and asked.  So, no question, no feedback on the salad.  \n\nAll in all, my experience was fair.  Some good, some not so good, some in the middle.  Good enough that I'll be back again and hopefully be able to give another star or two and a better review.  I like supporting our local businesses, hope they take feedback to heart, and succeed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-21T14:20:55-0400", "location_id": "8352473", "id": "301968634", "user": {"username": "MileHighJacket", "user_location": {"name": "Denver", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Good BBQ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29140-d8352473-r300852696-m11068-4_Barrel_Bar_Bbq-Arvada_Colorado.html#review300852696", "text": "Great selection of food and bar beverages.
