Our waitress for the night, Jasmine, was not only rude and appeared to have an attitude all night but she forgot my date's food...brought it out 15 mins after I had received mine. After we finally received our food...Jasmine was no where in site. She never came to check on us. After an hour of sitting there, Jasmine finally came by the table. When I asked for a refill on my water and the check, she walked away without even acknowledging my requests. She came back about 20 mins later and asked us if we were all set - mind you with no water! Once we finally received the check it was beyond wrong! Our meal wasn't even listed correctly. I used to love bar Louie however after this last experience I'm hesitant to go again. FYI be prepared to spend at least 4 hours here if you get Jasmine!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-29T16:51:47-0400", "location_id": "2433696", "id": "268953504", "user": {"username": "Twin_hummingbirds6", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
