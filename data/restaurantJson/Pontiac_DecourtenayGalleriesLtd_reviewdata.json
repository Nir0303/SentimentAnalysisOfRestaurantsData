Across from Bo's, it is only a couple of minutes from Birmingham up Woodward from Bloomfield. I say the poster for the Grand Opening on the 21st of November and went. Great Art ! and the Belgian chocolates as amuses bouches were wonderful. The gallery really has that belgo-french feel, yet the American Artist Rebecca gray smith shows the big American city of Chicago in all it's glory. Stop by - it has weekend hours and weekday ones. I am going back to buy chocolate as christmas gifts myselfrodger coltrain", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2003-11-23T19:00:00-0500", "location_id": "291441", "id": "1497651", "user": {"username": "belgoamerican2016", "user_location": {"name": "Aachen, Germany", "id": "187367"}}}]}
