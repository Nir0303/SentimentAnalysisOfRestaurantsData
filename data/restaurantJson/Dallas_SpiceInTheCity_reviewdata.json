It's a cool place. The ground floor is a takeaway counter and there's a small bar/restaurant one floor up.  \n\nThe server was very kind and casual and we were told that they hadn't had a \"hard opening\" yet. I'm not sure what they're waiting for. \n\nThey had an option for an entree with rice, two sides, and a drink. I had red Dahl, a side of naan, and a side of saag paneer. The paneer was marvelous- exactly how I like it. The Dahl seemed to be spiced with jalape\u00f1os - which seemed a bit off in the flavor department- but the restaurant *is unabashedly fusion* so maybe I'm being too conservative. It was still very good. \n\nThe drink menu was good. I had a local beer - which was very nice - and the selection of cocktails looked interesting but too pricey to expense to my work account. :(\n\nOne last thing - my  order was wrong when it was brought to the table. It happens. The important thing is how it's dealt with. The waiters fixed things immediately. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if we decide to go back again before the end of our trip.

We were visiting friends and family, so we all decided to go on a Friday evening, based on pictures and reviews we saw on Facebook.  This is primarily a walk-up eatery that does a brisk lunch business and has only a few tables in its lobby.  However, the food is the star here....and it wins an Oscar.  I have Celiac's, so I have to eat gluten-free, and over half the menu was gf.  I was ecstatic.  So, on to our favorites.  Appetizers:  the chicken wings were devoured in less than 5 minutes.  The pakkora (fried, but not greasy at all) with mango chutney....OMG....I still dream about them.  I went back and ordered some just for myself.  For entrees we had tikki masala (one order of chicken and one of shrimp) that was excellent.  The men in the party had the steak dish and it was gone in seconds (by the guy who said he didn't know if he'd like Indian food...he did).  The fusion tikki masala quesadilla was another favorite.  And the \"cool\" side of failti (sp?), a yogurt, cucumber, etc. dish, was delish.  The chocolates and cheese cake minis we had for dessert were luscious as well.  The price?  Four of us shared a tab for less than $75 with all that food!  No wonder this place get rave reviews from the media and has lunch crowds raving.\nFYI...so far this is a BYOB place, and wine glasses were brought out for us.  A wide range of non-alcoholic beverages are available.  Naveen, the owner, is a former dietician who has worked at major hospitals and knows how to keep things from being unhealthy.  The guilt factor is gone here.
