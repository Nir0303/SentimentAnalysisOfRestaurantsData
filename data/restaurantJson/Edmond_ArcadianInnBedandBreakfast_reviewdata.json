We stayed in the Master Suite which is decorated in deep purples, there is a huge tub, a large shower, a kind size bed and SO much character. You walk in and are instantly relaxed. There were personal touches ALL OVER the room welcoming us for our stay. There were signs on the vanity and bed welcoming us by name and on the table and hand written welcome with homemade cookies. They have a great video selection should you decide to watch a movie and the Inn is located within walking distance of many local restaurants. Our room had a seating area outside of the door for enjoying a nice glass of wine. The rooms were very quiet and bed was SOO comfortable. The next morning breakfast was delivered to our room and served by candle light. It was BY FAR the best breakfast we have ever had. Waffles with sweet butter sauce, a quiche, fruit, coffee and juice. Accompanied by the morning paper and a little note hoping we enjoyed our breakfast, again referring to us by name. We loved that we were treated like family and always referred to by name rather than just being another customer.

The Arcadian Inn is such a special place to stay. The house is gorgeous and comfortable. The innkeepers are so kind and thoughtful. They personalize so many things, and make you feel so welcome.\n\nWe've stayed in the Garden Room and the Royal Master. Both rooms are great, and have their own specific good things. The Royal Master has an excellent, large Jacuzzi tub. The Garden Room has a Jacuzzi tub as well, but it's a bit smaller. Both rooms are cozy and well decorated, pretty without being too feminine. The waffle weave robes are pure bliss. They have a large selection of DVDs to choose from, which is a nice touch. The Garden Room has a bit of street noise, as to be expected since it looks out over University Drive. The Royal Master has a private entrance and is on the back of the house so you feel more secluded.\n\nThen there's the breakfast. Oh my, the breakfast. It never fails to impress us. You arrange a time for breakfast to be delivered to your room, which I really appreciate (instead of having to meet in a dining room at a certain window of time). The food is so amazing, each time. There's usually something sweet, such as waffles or pancakes with their yummy vanilla butter syrup. There's also something more savory, such as a breakfast casserole, as well as fresh fruit with yogurt. They bring you orange juice in champagne glasses with a sugared rim, and light a silver candleabra for your table. The whole thing is beautifully laid out.\n\nWe recommend the Arcadian Inn to everyone we know, and definitely plan to stay there again. We'd like to stay in each room at least once!", "helpful_votes": "5", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Badammutterfly, Owner at Arcadian Inn Bed and Breakfast, responded to this review", "text": "Wow!

They bring it to you with a candelabra and you have breakfast by candlelight, hot peppermint towels for your face, fresh fruit, pumpkin pancakes with fresh diced apples and brown sugar, OJ in a champagne glass with a red sugar rim and a \"country eggroll\" creation that is delicious and all of it visually stunning. When we checked in we were offered a huge selection of DVD's from a barrister's cabinet to watch in our room with the flat panel TV and Bose-like surround sound system.
