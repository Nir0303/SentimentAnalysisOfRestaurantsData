I googled the Medford area and came across some nice reviews of the spa.  The best part was the same-day online booking (only 2 hours advance notice!)  If you are able to, I highly recommend Charmaine Carnes.  She was so sweet, professional, knowledgeable and highly skilled.  I had a signature deluxe facial and a soothing foot treatment...both SOOOOOO nice!  I didn't want to leave the spa...lol!  It was very clean, tastefully decorated and all products smelled wonderful.  An adorable British couple owns the spa and they were so friendly; they even served English Tea and cookies!  If you're looking for a relaxing time away for a few hours, definitely come to the European Touch Day Spa in Medford!  :)", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-01T08:27:44-0400", "location_id": "7104994", "id": "305857810", "user": {"username": "Dena P", "user_location": {"name": "Wanaque, New Jersey", "id": "46897"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Great spa  experience", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51965-d7104994-r295109854-m11068-The_European_Touch_Day_Spa_LLC-Medford_Oregon.html#review295109854", "text": "My wife and I enjoy traveling to new places, and we were delighted to find the European Touch day spa in Medford, Oregon.
