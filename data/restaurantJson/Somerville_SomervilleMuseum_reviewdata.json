Believe free but there is a donation box. I visit during Somerville Open Studios- lst weekend in May.  If you cant visit all the studios in 2 days (& you cant) nice place to start as they present a representative work of each artist who is showing that wknd.  See what you like, check out the map & visit their studio.  Saves alot of walking. Few years back had a wonderful quilt showing.  The landscapes & portraits were particularly fantastic.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-27T06:18:58-0400", "location_id": "9858075", "id": "386422188", "user": {"username": "wanderlust055", "user_location": {"name": "CambridgeMA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Great find!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41818-d9858075-r347662513-m11068-Somerville_Museum-Somerville_Massachusetts.html#review347662513", "text": "Visited for their \"Union Square at Work\" Exhibit that is currently running.  It is a great tiny little place with pleasant gallery space.  The current exhibit is a feature on the history past and present of Union Square.  It was an exceptional contrast of the continuing evolution of this city.  The photo essay of current Somerville Union Square business owners was very interesting and highlights the melting pot that is the USA.  If you are in the area stop by and check it out.  You should also ask about the floating staircase that is housed here, it is an architectural gem with some great provenance.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-14T09:24:39-0500", "location_id": "9858075", "id": "347662513", "user": {"username": "souzagar", "user_location": {"name": "massachusetts", "id": null}}}]}
