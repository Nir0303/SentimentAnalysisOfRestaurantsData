We met up there at 6 pm and there was no where to park. They only have a few parking spaces. We parked next door. We went inside and it smelled like a bathroom. There were only a few customers inside. There was 1 person in the kitchen and 1 person waiting tables. Despite the smell we went ahead and sat down. We ordered Chips & Salsa (but the catch is that you have to pay for it) . Definitely didn\u2019t like that. That\u2019s the first Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to were I had to pay for chips & dip. Would I order them again? No. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they weren\u2019t bad. I just wouldn\u2019t pay for them again. We went ahead and ordered the rest of our food. The food tasted great. The prices were good. The service wasn\u2019t bad.

Even though it was close to our work, we weren\u2019t familiar with it, and learned about it from a coupon in the new Entertainment Book.  The coupon was for buy one get one free entr\u00e9e.  We checked the online menu and the food looked fantastic, so off we went.  Immediately upon entering we were taken aback, not only because of the rundown and dirty appearance of the restaurant, but because it didn\u2019t smell like food, but like mildew and what can only be described as wet dog.  It was just odd to walk into a restaurant and not smell food.  The waitress took our drink orders and when the drinks arrived they tasted like turpentine.  The waitress said \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t like diet soda either\u2019.  We finally convinced her to get us new drinks, which weren\u2019t any better.  While waiting on our food we asked about chips and salsa, only to be told that would be an additional $2.50.  No thanks.  We were about ready to just leave when our food showed up.  It was amazing.  I have no idea how these beautiful plates were put together in this place.  The meals looked amazing.  We were in shock as we started to eat.  OMG!  The food was insanely good!  We kept commenting to each other that there was no way we expected food of this caliber, due to the restaurant itself and the wait staff.  Granted, my order was wrong, I received pork instead of chicken in my burrito, but the food was so good we just didn\u2019t care!  We were already planning on bringing our friends in, because we knew they would also be shocked at how good the food was, compared to how horrible we expected it to be.  At the end of the meal we were stuffed and happy, and told the waitress we had a coupon.  \u201cNo, you don\u2019t\u201d, was her reply.  Excuse me?  \u201cWe don\u2019t have coupons\u201d.  I showed her that the coupon had the restaurant\u2019s name, address, and phone number on it, a partial menu on the back, and even a survey to fill out about the restaurant and service, and that it has an expiration date of 12/20/2015.  \u201cI don\u2019t know where people are getting these.  We don\u2019t have coupons on our website, and we don\u2019t take coupons.  This is the 4th one this week\u201d.  In shock over how rudely she dismissed the coupon, with no apology, no offer to let us speak to a manager, nothing, we explained that this was our first visit, that we wouldn\u2019t have known about the place if it wasn\u2019t for the coupon, and that we enjoyed the meal and planned to return, but that if the coupon wasn\u2019t honored that we wouldn\u2019t be back.  It\u2019s just the principle of the thing.  We drove to the restaurant and ordered food in good faith, and were now being treated like we had done something wrong.  The waitress just said \u2018Well, we have Taco Tuesdays\u201d.  What?  We actually said \u201cWe just told you we aren\u2019t coming back, why are you telling us about other specials?\u201d.  SO, this meal was a rollercoaster.  Apprehension about the condition of the restaurant, how bad it smelled, and the rudeness of the wait staff, then 180 degree turn around because of how amazing the food was, to anger, disappointment, and resentment over being treated like we had done something wrong and the complete refusal to take our coupon.  All things considered, the food was great, but if this is how a first time customer is treated, we will not be back, and will not recommend this place to any of our friends, which is sad, because there is a real lack of quality Mexican restaurants out there.  Thanks for lunch, Fogones, but we will not be back.
