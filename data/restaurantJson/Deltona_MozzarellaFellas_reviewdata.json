This is why I thought of Mozzarella Fella's, quick & on my way home.\n I just had to stop and check them out. I was greeted by, Tammy, who was very friendly and explained and answered all my questions. \nThen Tammy took my order, 1 Meatball Parmesan Hero, 1 Chicken Parmesan Hero and an order of Mozzarella Fella's Garlic Rolls (6), that Tammy had suggested.\nWe returned home and enjoyed every BITE! Keep up the \"Good\" job. See you soon!\nDr. Martin & Mrs. Kathryn Steinbaum", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-14T15:18:33-0500", "location_id": "9773578", "id": "340089902", "user": {"username": "kathryn s", "user_location": {"name": "Deltona, Florida", "id": "34180"}}}]}
