Good big chunks of broccoli and snow peas, good quality medium tailless veined shrimp infused with garlic and red pepper, and secret ingredients blended to perfection.  Also had Sichuan green beans which were Hakka'd with the pickled cabbage and nice and spicy.  Added dim sum - shrimp dumplings, which were in the most delicate wrappings and delectable, and the Juicy Pork dumplings which were in very light dough (as opposed to the chewy fried dough of the potstickers), with bits of savory pork inside, but not overwhelmingly meaty (which I prefer).

Sticky Rice Dumplings \u7cbd\u5b50 are popular too, the one we want, with meat, sold out.\nWe also ordered  Braised Pork with Rice \u53f0\u5f0f\u9b6f\u8089\u98ef , which was a failure, without true taste of Taiwanese rice with pork (the owner explained that the chef did not know how to do it right even he taught him how to) ; Pan Fried Scallion Pancake \u8525\u6cb9\u9905 ,which was too dry, not much tasty. \nThis restaurant was plain and modest in and out. Service was good though. The owner was really friendly.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-06-15T16:57:41-0400", "location_id": "4937128", "id": "210489550", "user": {"username": "Chuang004", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Best Chinese food on the east side", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58702-d4937128-r205617266-m11068-Eastern_Pearl-Redmond_Washington.html#review205617266", "text": "The Chinese food in this area is pretty unreliable so I was very excited to come across this place.
