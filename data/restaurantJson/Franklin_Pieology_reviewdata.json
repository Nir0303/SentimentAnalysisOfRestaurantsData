No other place in the Nashville can make a pizza as good as Pieology for the price or for that matter any price.

But be warned that unlike most pizza's, it's one pizza per adult. \nPro's and Con's\n* Larger than a personal pan, but due to size, one pizza per adult.\n* Very thin crust, if you like those, you'll be thrilled, otherwise no. \n* Any toppings you want, but they've VERY skimpy when first adding. For example, I asked for spinach (with many other veggie's) and they literally put on 4 spinach leaves.  She did add more when I asked, but *maybe* 8 to 10 total. The sauce is also *very* thin, it doesn't even cover the entire pizza, no matter what you pick.\n* Short cooking time but HORRIBLE wait in even a short line!\n* Gluten free options, but if you have a serious allergy, avoid or check as I do not think it's made on separate equipment\n\nI've been about 2 or 3 times. I like them okay. Biggest problem-  RIDICULOUS wait time! This is just one example, but I've had some variant of this EVERY TIME I went, whether in peak time or when they were in a lull.\nExample wait -  I went early Sunday afternoon - around 4 - and there was literally only one person in line ahead of me. He was getting 3 pizza's and had already finished the order on one when I arrived. I had to wait TEN MINUTES before I could even get to the counter to request my order. And then felt 'hurried' b/c they called the next person up right afterwards who were physically standing close and doing the impatient 'Hurry up' look while I ordered my toppings. Why did you not figure out how to do this when I was waiting people???\n\nAnd the wait was Despite the fact there were 4 employee's in the back who were obviously Not on break but were just standing around talking with each other for what looked like simple chit chat, again -for ten minutes. Which is absolutely ridiculous for a place that is essentially a dressed up fast food restaurant. The person actually preparing the pizza seemed to be going in slow motion, and not just because I was hungry, truly, she just moved physically very slow. Again, not good for an area where you need someone who can reach and scatter ingredients quickly!\n\nThe cooking time is fairly fast, but also can cause a slightly undercooked pizza - again, this has happened every time I went. \n\nThe topping's are reasonably good and they have a wide variety, but they don't add much as you can't and have it all cook thoroughly I would assume. Super thin crust is tasty at least. \n\nSuggestions to them: \n* Options for a thicker crust pizza with a longer cooking time, and a larger size.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-12T07:54:54-0400", "location_id": "10730726", "id": "427252732", "user": {"username": "LachLannae", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, TN", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Not bad", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55055-d10730726-r425358359-m11068-Pieology-Franklin_Tennessee.html#review425358359", "text": "Now, this isn't a world class pie but for $9 for every topping available, it's darn good.
