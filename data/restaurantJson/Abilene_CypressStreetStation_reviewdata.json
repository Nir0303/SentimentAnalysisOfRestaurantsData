Firstly, we got a waiter who was brand new.  We ordered drinks- he had no idea what some were or if they had the stuff to make the drinks- someone should have shadowed this poor young man.  It wasn't his fault, it was his lack of proper training before he was cut loose.  They had limited options, we thought,  for appetizers so we ordered light options-I got a grilled cheese. When the young man brought out drinks, he did so with his fingers on the rim of the glass where you would normally drink- a no no which training should have taken care of .  Then when delivered, my fries were delicious, but my grilled cheese was cold- a little timing issue there.  When it came time to pay, we waited and waited ...come to find out our server was not allowed to use the cash register and was waiting for someone else to close us out.  We felt so bad for the young man that we did not complain, but the manager/owner or someone needs to work on this.
