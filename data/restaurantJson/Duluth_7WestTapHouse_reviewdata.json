While this is not a high end place, I give a 5 star rating because it does what it sets out to do very well.......provide a nice bar atmosphere that serves good food, feels fun, and is appropriate for a wide variety of customers. My usual routine is to come here for supper and few beers by myself and I keep coming back! The bartenders are friendly and just talkative enough and I also usually get into a conversation about something with the other people at the bar. They have a nice, small menu that is cooked right behind the bar and offers some innovative burger ideas and other simple meals. The house made chips come with your choice of seasonings and are a great addition to any of the meals. The tap beer selection may not be as big as some \"beer snob\" bars, but it is quite extensive and rotates to offer seasonal choices and can accommodate a variety of beer tastes. The 7 West Taphouse can get a bit busy, especially given it's fairly small size, but one great thing is that I see people move to let others have room, or even share a table, which is the way it should be! There are TV's so you can catch a game here, but it's not necessarily a sports bar so don't expect the TVs to be blasting the announcer. Parking is limited on Superior Street in front, but there is a nice public parking garage a block away on Lake Avenue and First Street that charges $1.00 and hour for parking and it's the way to go.

Burgers and fries are where they shine, skip the apps and tacos. The fries are fresh cut and fried to perfection, not limp, not greasy. Depending on the seasoning, the salt level can be overwhelming. The beef patties can be swapped out by a vegetarian patty (not vegan). The burgers are creative without being over the top or pretentious. My order came out around $15 (not including tip) for a burger, fries, and a craft beer.
