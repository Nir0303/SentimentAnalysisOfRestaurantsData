I had the Chicken Chimi Special and a few margaritas.  Like most places they served chips and salsa before the food came out.  The chips were good and the salsa was great.

I think there was a tomato and onion mix in with the chicken.  The margaritas were outstanding.  I usually only have one with a meal but had to order a second one.  The service was outstanding.  Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly from the time I entered until the time I left.  My server was extremely attentive. The prices are very reasonable.
