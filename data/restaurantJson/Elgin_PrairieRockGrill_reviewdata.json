Decided to give it another try for a few beers and an appetizer.  Stopped in on a Sunday at 5:00 and we were the only customers.  Sat at the bar and ordered beers and the nachos.  Had to ask for a coaster as my beer was sweating all over the bar. Not a big deal but since we are the only customers would have expected at least coasters with our drinks.  The nachos came with barely warm nacho sauce with a handful of black beans, corn and jalapenos with a blob of sour cream. It was supposed to come with a side of ranchero sauce which we didn't get.  We sat at the bar and the server didn't return until we were ready to go so didn't get a chance to ask for it. The nachos were not good, the service was not good and the atmosphere was not good.  Cool can nacho sauce is not good eats to me along with lack of attention from the bartender to see if our food was ok.

You have to wait a long time to ask if you want a beer, even though no one is at the bar. There is one gentleman at the bar who is on top of things. He remembers people's names and is friendly. It would be nice to see more of that.\n\nb)Beer Selection. Although they have a few good craft beers, bring more in. The owner once said that people don't buy the craft beer. His competition, The Walnut Room\" is saturated with craft beer. I guess that's why the competition is always packed. Get more CRAFT BEER!!\n\nc) I know you serve bar food, but it doesn't have to taste like bar food. Come on! Have respect for your establishment. Try bringing in a true chef! One can only take your hamburguesses for so long!\n\nThe Bad:\nThe owner, an older gentleman, sees me in all the time, yet never once makes an effort to welcome me to his establishment, even though I have disposable income and spend $50 or more at this place.
