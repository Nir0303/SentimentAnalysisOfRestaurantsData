In our case, we first came in two years ago when we were new to the area and my wife noticed a sign for a hair salon. Mary actually does run a first-rate salon in a separate, back portion of her marketplace, and we heartily recommend it.  But it is the front restaurant portion that we are reviewing, and it is quite large, an eclectic combination of a deli serving unique and delicious hot and cold sandwiches, a smoothie-juice bar that appeals to our healthier side, and more recently the addition of an art gallery. And Mary's has always served as an unofficial neighborhood/community meeting space with lots of big tables for families and groups.\n    Our visit today was typical. I had one of my favorites, \"The Sancho\", which has pastrami, jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers, spinach, tomatoes and avocado on marble rye. And my wife enjoyed \"Mary's D'Lite\", which starts with turkey breast and then adds cheese and fresh vegetables including red and green peppers, cucumbers, avocado (of course, this is California), onions, tomatoes, spinach, sprouts, lettuce and pesto, on multi-grain bread.  Both sandwiches are huge, and we ended up taking half home for later.\n   I mentioned Mary's juices above.  You just have to try her \"Signature Green Juice\" made with fresh ginger, spinach, oranges, apples and other goodies..  My wife always has one with her meal, and then buys one to take home.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-08T10:15:17-0400", "location_id": "7998382", "id": "416186792", "user": {"username": "shelby371", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Old fashion, fresh, healthy and hometown", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32210-d7998382-r267637674-m11068-Mary_s_Downtown_Plaza-Chula_Vista_California.html#review267637674", "text": "Marys downtown plaza is the cutest little market with a huge juice bar in front and a DELICIOUS sandwich deli in back.
