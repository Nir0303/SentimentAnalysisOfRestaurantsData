The place was full & the drinks were very good. I went to the buffet & to my surprise there were no sneeze guards in any part of the buffet. The food was in Chafing Dishes but the covers were open as many people go through the line, the condiments had no covers at all. I use to work in a restaurant & on buffets we always had sneeze guards, it was a policy for us. I only had the buffet & did not have any other item for the menu. To make a long story short, the Taco buffet food was not tasty & I did not have a good night. Maybe it was the fact that the price for the buffet was only $7.00, I would rather pay more & have better food & covers on all food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-02-18T13:51:18-0500", "location_id": "492418", "id": "255092678", "user": {"username": "jc p", "user_location": {"name": "Oxnard, California", "id": "32837"}}}]}
