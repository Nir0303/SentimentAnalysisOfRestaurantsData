The\nOther day my husband and I decided to\ngive it a try. I'm so glad we did. We ordered\ncheeseburgers (your choice of cheese) &\nfries. Delicious burger and a bun that doesn't crumble and fall apart. The fries\nwere warm and crispy.\nI said \"take out\" at the beginning of this review. There are a few tables inside &\npicnic tables outside. Also, many choices\nof burgers and fillings.
