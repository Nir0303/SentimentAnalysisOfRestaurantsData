Other posts described this place as noisy but despite a full room, it was not loud at all, maybe we had a good group of  well-behaved people the night I went.  Another post described the d\u00e9cor as cheesy\u2026.I say nay, nay. It was warm and inviting, a nice place to sit back, relax and enjoy a fine meal!\nService was friendly, efficient and informative. The bread they start you out with that comes with marinara and goat cheese was off the chain!  Bread is my Achilles and I was in major trouble!  The break was piping hot, perfectly crispy on the outside and delightfully chewy inside.  A bread lovers dream come true (mine\u2019s as least!). I was a bit skeptical of the goat cheese and marinara but what a wonderful combination.  Goat cheese was creamy and light, marinara was not over powering or sweet.  \n We started out with the grilled long stem artichokes\u2026simply divine! This is not your average artichoke dish.  I am sooo happy we decided to give it a try! So tender and flavorful\u2026.and the sauce it was served with?  I could have gotten a loaf of bread and sopped up a huge bowl of it and called it a night! I fought the urge to do so though!  \n \nWe ordered 3 fish dishes and they did not disappoint.  One was the special of the day, flounder over risotto topped with 2 large shrimp, the other was Mediterranean Sea Bass and the third was the Gulf Black Grouper.  All were nice sized portions and cooked to perfection. All were very tasty but the Grouper is what stood out to me.  I would order any of the three again. \nDessert was the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. While this was very good, it was not in my top 5. This is my husband\u2019s favorite dessert\u2026.he did not have a problem finishing it.\nWhile the prices may seem on the high side, I felt it was indicative of the value. This is a wonderful date night or special occasion restaurant for sure.
