Very tasty, especially if you put their salsa on it instead of salad dressing.  $7.99 but I think very worth it.  I recommend the taco salad whether you get steak or chicken.  Both very good.

I have had their burgers which are big and good.  Their french fries are good.  Their breakfasts are usually ok.  I paid over $17.00 for two steak burritos and two orders of fries.  Again, the fries were good.  But the burritos were tasteless and borderline disgusting.  Too much dried and bland refried beans, and not enough meat or rice.  I was told that it would have cheese and sour cream on it but we sure didn't taste any.  The meat wasn't bad but wasn't great.  Overall the burritos were blah.  They just had no flavor to them.  We have said before that we won't go there again and we do, but this time I think we really won't go there again.  It costs too much for food that isn't real tasty and enjoyable.
