The food is consistent, the atmosphere with live music and the quick service from both the bartenders and wait staff make this place a 5 star.  When you do critique work it is not about how a particular place is in comparison to others in the world, it is how they compare to others in their area.  Most of the food items are well above on par with their competitors in Frisco.  While I did see someone say they had a better chicken fried steak somewhere else, Stan\u2019s is not a BBQ place churning a thousand of these a day, and the one\u2019s that they do are pretty good; and you can have a real drink for a change.  In fact their buffalo chicken sandwich is better than most of the places in Frisco churning them out and their burgers are pretty good.  Put that together with live entertainment on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night and every other Monday, and they exceed the expectations of many of the venues in Frisco.  The music, drinks and food are worthy of a much more expensive place.  So if you find Blue Goose a little too full for you, head on over to Stan\u2019s you might be surprised.
