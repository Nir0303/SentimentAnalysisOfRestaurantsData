Ordered the steak & malibu chicken, the other people I were with ordered the salad bar.  We ordered and were seated quickly.  Great service, our server came by and delivered our drinks.  My meal was delicous and the salad bar was a little small but it had everything they wanted.  Cheese bread was delivered when my meal came.  They had tvs posted around the restaurant and we got to watch some Olymmpic events.  Overall a good meal for standard Sizzler.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-08-20T14:46:24-0400", "location_id": "4963170", "id": "408045744", "user": {"username": "twinmom8", "user_location": {"name": "Torrance, California", "id": "33182"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "I've Been to Better ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33023-d4963170-r393043660-m11068-Sizzler-San_Leandro_California.html#review393043660", "text": "We paid 30 dollars for 2 adults and 1 child for the salad bar. It was not like any of the Sizzler restaurant salad bars I've eaten at, and one of the smallest too. The layout was weird. It was the bare minimum for a salad bar and not too clean to add. Very basic, the fruit looked old, the rolls were cold, and not much of a selection. The chicken good and our waiter Mike was really good. The restroom wasn't clean at all. Had it not been for the Mike and the chicken~I would have given them a lower rating. I won't be back.\n\nIt's located in San Leandro, CA on the corner of Davis and E. 14th St.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-15T16:36:39-0400", "location_id": "4963170", "id": "393043660", "user": {"username": "jazzoee", "user_location": {"name": "Oakland, California", "id": "32810"}}}]}
