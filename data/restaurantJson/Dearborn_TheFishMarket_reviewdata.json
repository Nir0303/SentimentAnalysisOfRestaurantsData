The Fish Market is a mandatory stop for us.  The fish is so fresh and cooked to perfection:  Hot and moist inside, crispy and tasty on the outside.  We have been taken to other much more expensive seafood restaurants for fish, but none are as delicious as The Fish Market.  Not only is The Fish Market more tasty, the prices are half what you'd pay at the other places.  The only problem is it really is for carry out.

It is a place to buy seafood to take home. HOWEVER....they have a menu that includes a wide variety of fish you can have fried on the spot and take to go. We tried the cod and lake perch fresh fried with a side of fries. The fries were just so-so, but the fish was so so good. The best fried fish I have ever had. Crispy and flavorful on the outside, creamy and delicious on the inside. This is truly a hidden gem. Don't expect to go and have a nice sit down elegant seafood dinner.
