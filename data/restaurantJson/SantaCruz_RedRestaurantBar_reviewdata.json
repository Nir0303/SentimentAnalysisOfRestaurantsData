We did not have a reservation and they were very friendly and accommodating about not having a table but offered to serve us in the bar.  We really wanted a dining experience so asked to wait for an available table.   They made us feel welcome while we waited and the wait was pretty short, and we were seated at a very comfortable table.  The chairs are padded and as comfortable as the expensive ones I bought for my own dining room table.  This was a nice surprise as it seems many restaurants have such uncomfortable chairs. \n\nThe food was awesome from start to finish for our meal.  We started with some excellent Onion rings for an appetizer.   For our first course I started off with the Laap Salad and my wife had the Caesar salad. We shared plates and both agreed that each salad was exceptional.  We have had Caesar salads everywhere for years, but this one stood out as one of the best we have had anywhere.  The Laap salad was unique with Thai type flavors and steak.  A surprising and different salad but a great treat as well.\n\nThe service to this point had been slow, but tolerable because the food was so good and the staff was friendly and happy.  Then our waitress confessed there had been a technical problem with our order, so it would be another 20 minutes.  This would not have been a big deal except the pace of dinner had been so slow to this point.  I give the waitress loads of credit because for one she was honest and didn't avoid us at all even knowing we would not be happy.  She also brought us an order of fantastic french fries to snack while we waited and comped us a round of drinks to boot.  I give her and her manager top marks for caring about their customers and making it right. I would return here based on this good service and the fantastic food assures I will come back.  \n\nFor our main course we both had the filet mignon, and again we agreed it was one of the absolute best steaks I have had in some time.  Wrapped in bacon, cooked to perfection and super tender.  It had a light port wine reduction and was served with the most awesome creamy mashed potatoes.  My only complaint would be I wished there was more of those yummy potatoes......  and that is hardly a complaint...\n\nOur meal was topped off with some great desserts but we had to take them to go, because of the other couple we were with had kids to attend to at home, and the meal had taken so long.  \n\nOverall I give this place top marks. I hope they can make the adjustments to have a little better pace of service because to us the food was special and by far the best of four restaurants we tried for Restaurant Week.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-10-26T14:30:45-0400", "location_id": "4914273", "id": "322153812", "user": {"username": "Paul B", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Cruz, California, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Drinks and appetizers delight", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33048-d4914273-r278407712-m11068-Red_Restaurant_Bar-Santa_Cruz_California.html#review278407712", "text": "Creative and delicious!

The restaurant/ bar was packed and lively. We had called ahead for a reservation, but the table ahead of us was not done their meal when we got their. They sat us on some cozy couches and served us our drinks. It took a while for the beverages to arrive, but the cocktails were worth the wait. We also orders some tasty fries while we waited for our table. After a moderate wait we were seated, and the entrees which we had ordered while waitin for the table arrived shortly after. The food was pretty good all around but some stood out more than others. I had the hanger steak sandwich which was very good. The best thing about this bar/ restaurant was its live music. They had a fantastic hip hop dj and two incredible vocalists performing with him. I was just passing through, but if I knew this bar had live music every weekend I would make this a must stop in Santa Cruz.
