Very small (5 tables), usually filled around dinner time.  The Thai basil chicken is incredible -- very spicy (we always order extra spicy) with a good helping of steamed rice.  The Chinese chicken dishes are good (I've had the garlic chicken and kung pao), but I'm not a fan of big chicken chunks.  (The chicken in the basil chicken dish is thinly sliced.)  The crab rangoon is decent, and the hot and sour soup is excellent.  A great find in a city with otherwise mediocre Chinese food.\n\nAs an added bonus, I overheard one of the servers saying that the menu is going to be changed to feature more Thai food. Right now, Sa-Wad-Dee is *the* only Thai place worth eating at in Missoula.  Pagoda might well be the only other!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-27T13:41:33-0400", "location_id": "4708772", "id": "398142294", "user": {"username": "No L", "user_location": {"name": "Anaconda, Montana", "id": "29679"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Outstanding", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45277-d4708772-r382845407-m11068-Pagoda_Chinese_Food-Missoula_Montana.html#review382845407", "text": "Outstanding authentic cuisine come out of the tiny kitchen at Pagoda. There are only 4 or 5 places to sit. It's cozy and comfy though. Take out seems to be a large amount of their business. \nThe Tom Kha Gy soup is the best we've had in years with subtle flavors served with a generous side of fluffy rice. The Pad Thai with pork really hit the mark. Large pieces of savory pork with scrambled egg mixed into a perfect sauce. Not too much sauce. Just enough. The Hot and Sour Chicken/ Sesame Chicken lunch portion came with fried rice AND noodles. The flavors were sweet and savory served piping hot with crispy deep fried chicken chunks. The lunch plate was heaping with food. We shared hot tea that was perfectly brewed Thai tea. We can't wait until we next visit Missoula for another round of Pagoda Chinese Food!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-15T10:12:10-0400", "location_id": "4708772", "id": "382845407", "user": {"username": "Ananda-Bindy", "user_location": {"name": "los lunas, new mexico", "id": null}}}]}
