(A BBQ place where I live now actually has tofu BBQ on the menu and that's blasphemous!)\n\nI grew up in B'ham and used to wear out Golden Rule in high school. I live 6 hours north now in a BBQ desert and on a recent trip home I just had to have some GR and I'm glad I did. \n\nIt's still the same. Busy, as always but with good, speedy, and friendly Southern service. My mother's hamburger was huge and said to be really good and my pulled pork and fries were good and hit the spot. The sauce is good with a touch of tang and the meat had a nice smokey flavor. We were served quickly and enjoyed our lunch. It was also inexpensive. \n\nIf you want good and simple BBQ from an old school Southern BBQ joint, then GR is worth a try.
