I had a City Fest, a Vienna lager, and my wife had a Boca Blonde, their traditional German Munich Helles Lager. Both were excellent representations of their styles.\n\nFor food I ordered the 10 in personal pizza with mushrooms, meatball slices and pepperoni. I loved it! My wife ordered the chicken tenders and to quote her \"These are the best chicken tenders I have ever eaten\". I had one, they were delicious!\n\nThey have menu other food items and other craft beers to choose from.
