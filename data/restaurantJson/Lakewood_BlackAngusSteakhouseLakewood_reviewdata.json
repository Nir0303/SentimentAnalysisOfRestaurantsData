The Lakewood location makes it just the way we like...juicy and crispy!!!!!  A different location put a sauce on it without us asking and we didn't like that but Lakewood leaves it simple. I like tarter sauce (and they make a good one) but my husband just uses lemon. I'm like a creature of habit because I always have broccoli with shaved parmesan cheese as one of my sides. I'm on a gluten free diet but my mouth waters just from smelling the bread and sometimes I take a tiny piece with the oats on top!!!! (I take food enzymes that are supposed to block gluten even for that tiny taste!)  We've been going for lunch lately as it feels like just the right amount of food without getting overfull . My husband orders the delicious Blackberry ginger ale sometimes and I always look forward to a sip or 2 of that!!!!!  We seem to always get coupons in the mail so for a wonderful lunch under $10, it can't be beat!!!! Once in a while when we use the coupon for dinner and get an appetizer to share we love the grilled artichoke but if we want something much less fattening we love the shrimp catalog. I know most people go there for the meat but if you're a salmon lover (and even if you're not) there's will win you over!!!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-13T00:09:21-0400", "location_id": "1972434", "id": "221491623", "user": {"username": "babsy998", "user_location": {"name": "bellflower, ca", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Decent Place To Go", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32605-d1972434-r215559839-m11068-Black_Angus_Steakhouse_Lakewood-Lakewood_California.html#review215559839", "text": "Maybe 3.5.
