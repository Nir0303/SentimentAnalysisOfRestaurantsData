I totally enjoyed both evenings. Tio Carlos caters great Mexican food, and they have a bar at the museum as well. Once the weather stays a little warmer, they will have music events outdoors. They have a beautiful garden with a huge, covered stage and it's even available for rental for private parties. The two times I went, there wasn't a cover, but merely a request for a donation for the band. I NEVER have cash, so don't forget that when you go, you'll want to drop something in the bucket. The bar and cafe, memorabilia for sale and entry to the exhibits can be put on a debit or credit card, so that helps.\nThe gallery exhibits are awesome. It's hard to believe how many incredible musicians are from our great State! There are concert posters, original costumes, signed guitars, articles, letters and photos galore!\nIf you want to make sure you have a table, call ahead and let them know how many and they'll be happy to take care of you.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-03-23T19:04:40-0400", "location_id": "2196934", "id": "358024615", "user": {"username": "laj2008", "user_location": {"name": "West Indies", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "This has moved to Irving, TX.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56852-d2196934-r294763458-m11068-Texas_Musicians_Museum-Waxahachie_Texas.html#review294763458", "text": "If you get a chance go see this place.
