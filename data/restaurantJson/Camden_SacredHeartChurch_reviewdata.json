Sacred Heart is a Catholic church in the midst of the troubled City of Camden. This 19th century graceful Christian temple is serving some of the poorest poor. You will notice the humble neighborhood surrounding the church. It is fairly safe to get to this church by car as it is located on relatively prominent streets but common sense vigilance is advised. The highlights of the interior include the wooden carvings. Admire also the simple classical beauty of the interiors. Best is to visit on Sunday during the mass.\nThe church offers social programs and appears to be a true pillar of this underprivileged community.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-31T17:05:20-0400", "location_id": "7268936", "id": "433399981", "user": {"username": "podrozniczka60", "user_location": {"name": "New Jersey", "id": "28951"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "You will be inspired!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46340-d7268936-r321361742-m11068-Sacred_Heart_Church-Camden_New_Jersey.html#review321361742", "text": "Absolutely magnificent church in the center of urban Camden.
