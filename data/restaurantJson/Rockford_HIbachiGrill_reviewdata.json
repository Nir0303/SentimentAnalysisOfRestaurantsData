They have a wide variety of dishes to sample that re HOT and not luke warm to cold. The Mongolian barbecue station is my favorite because you can pick the meats and vegetable you want to including shrimp and they prepare it on their huge tepan area. You also can have NY strip steak as part of your buffet. Every time my daughter returns home from college a trip to Hibachi is a must!!!
