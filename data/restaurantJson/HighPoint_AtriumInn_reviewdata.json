I work in a hotel and I know that we legally have to inform guests of the rate difference....was not worth it! Was run down, rooms were outdated, no refrigerators in room, tv batteries didn't work and the view outside was right into family houses living room.

I prepaid by check (required for market) 2 rooms for three occupants over a month prior to Spring 2014 market. To confirm this reservation, I received a fax from ATrium, indicating the days of my tenancy and corresponding amounts due for each night. As they had made an error on this form (initial contact over phone as they had no internet capacity to book market reservation), I re-faxed it back with the correct dates, indicating a Saturday arrival and Tuesday vacation of the rooms. A long story short, they refused to acknowledge their error, even though I provided a copy of the transmission. This resulted in my having to rent another room 10 miles down the road PLUS I received no refund of the room they claim I reserved for Tuesday night, despite my vacation of said room, as previously communicated BOTH verbally and via fax (I have the records and presented to them). In short, their error resulted in me incurring an $800+ loss PLUS Mr. PAtel had the gall to call me a liar in front of my employees, when it was he who was at fault and yet refused to remedy the error of his staff member. He's a greedy, rude innkeeper that will never see my business again..... good luck if you choose this lame motel.", "helpful_votes": "14", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-07-21T09:45:56-0400", "location_id": "632530", "id": "216629462", "user": {"username": "Jjmcclorey", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
