Highway noise is tolerable when cars aren't hotrodding along the feeder road like they were all night at this location. But then there were also 3 guys standing outside my room all night with a dog. And peaple walked by every 3 minutes all night long. And there were kids outside till all hours.\nIt was miserable and I promise to never stay at another motel 6 again as long as places which could be repaired and watched are taken care of.stay away if you need sleep.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-03-09T16:20:26-0500", "location_id": "244399", "id": "99594439", "user": {"username": "dellicsfist", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2008-03", "title": "Great stay for the price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60768-d244399-r14420970-m11068-Motel_6_El_Paso_Central-El_Paso_Texas.html#review14420970", "text": "The rooms are large.
