I wrestled long and hard with the idea of writing about it as they make it fresh, so when it's gone, it's gone.

For $5, you get a huge piece that is so moist, so fresh, the flavours so spot-on, that you will surely be unable to believe your luck and will immediately order a second one. I did not like tiramisu or coffee-flavoured anything (other than actual coffee) before trying Nick's. I am now a convert, and have yet to find tiramisu that I enjoy more than Nick's.\n\nJust one note on location: it is on a quiet road, and I've never felt unsafe at their door at night, but the overall area around this stretch off Hillsboro is not nice.
