I have had massages all over and never have had a massage help with pain, tension, stress and relaxation as much as the one I received from Sunnie. In fact I drove my husband from Denver the following day to also get a massage from her. He also had the same wonderful experience with her! I plan to drive from Denver to Colorado Springs on a monthly basis to see Sunnie at MX Spa.
