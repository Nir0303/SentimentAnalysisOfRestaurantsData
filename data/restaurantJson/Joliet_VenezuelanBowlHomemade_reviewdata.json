I didn't know their hours, they close at 2pm Mon. -Wed. and it was right at 2. The guy at the counter said they could do a carryout order for me, I said yes as I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. I ordered the shredded beef Empanada appetizer (3 pieces for $5) and the Pabellon Bowl with shredded beef ($7.95).\n\nThe empanadas were tasty.They are made with white corn and well filled. They are served with a green dipping sauce that tasted good. Not too spicy, it was flavorful.\n\nBesides the shreeded beef, the Pabellon bowl had white rice, 3 fried plantain slices, black beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese. I had never had any kind of plantain before and have to say I liked the fried ones they served. Outside of the plantains, I know it sounds like a bowl you could get at other places but it was very good. There were subtle differences in flavors from the black beans and the shredded beef, making it a different experience from the chain fast food bowl places. A good kind of different. The portion was a large amount for the price, very filling also.\n\nIt is not a large menu, but that's good. If you do enough things well, you don't need hundreds of items. They have 3 appetizers listed besides the empanadas, a soup of the day, 6 other House Favorite bowls, a salad bowl, 2 main dishes for a little more that include soup and arepa, 5 sides, 9 types of arepas, and Quesillo (Venezuelan Flan).\n\nI brought my food home and shared some of it and my wife and daughter also liked it. I definitly want to go back again. It's closer to home than any of the chain \"bowl\" places and just as good if not better. If you are in the area, its worth trying out. Almost across the street from the Rialto Theater in Joliet, another option to have a bite to eat before a show there.\n\nThe menu I brought home lists hours of Mon.-Wed. 10 am to 2 pm, Thu.-Fri. 10am to 6pm, Sat.-Sun.-Special Events.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-01-07T11:50:09-0500", "location_id": "7382241", "id": "248139151", "user": {"username": "verchad", "user_location": {"name": "illinois", "id": null}}}]}
