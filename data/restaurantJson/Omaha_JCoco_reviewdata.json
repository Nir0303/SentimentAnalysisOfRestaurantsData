The food that we have ordered has been good.  The problem: every single time, the staff at this restaurant behaves as though we--and other patrons around us--are inconveniences to their evening. If this were Paris, I'd probably accept it, maybe even in New York City. Do not make the mistake of asking how a dish is prepared as it will be greeted with scorn. Do they not know the menu? Or do they have the expectation that if the chef cooks it, you'll eat it? The location is in a neighborhood in midtown Omaha, so if you live nearby, this restaurant is really the only option.  On the other hand, if you have a car, there are so many other restaurants in Omaha from which to choose for food that are just as delicious and innovative. If you are a person who tries to frequent locally owned establishments, Brushis, for example, off of 132nd and Dodge is an amazing restaurant. Every time we visit Omaha, we have also visited Brushis. In comparison, the food is delicious, ambience pleasant, and service welcoming and prompt.
