This is a spacious diner with plenty of seating. Very clean with lots of natural light. We were taken care of by a very attentive and friendly waitress.  \n\nI already knew I wanted the biscuits with sausage and gravy, which I ordered with eggs over hard. Delicious! Gravy had a nice peppery kick that hit the back of the palate. Biscuits were perfectly cooked. Had a glass of cranberry juice with it. All in all, a fantastic breakfast for me. \n\nHusband was not so pleased. He decided on pancakes and sausage. He prefers patties but they had links and they came out overcooked and a bit tasteless. His pancakes were dry with absolutely no flavor. He did love his coffee, though. When the waitress came to see how things were, I mentioned the problem with the pancakes. She should have just taken his plate and brought him new ones, but instead, she said something about next time we come in, she'll make sure he gets fresh ones. What does that mean exactly? That there are old ones back there? \n\nSo, I have to score Tower Grill as average. I'm dying to go back because I had great food.
