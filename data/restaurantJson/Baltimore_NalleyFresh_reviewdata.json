Because I just had a religious experience here. I loved it all. Everything. Even the flooring (tile that looks like reclaimed wood?!)\n\nThere are so many choices that it's understandable if you get overwhelmed. Here are the basics: you can order a rice bowl, a noodle bowl, a salad, or soup and pick from a bazillion toppings, dressings, and broths to create a lunch that will help you achieve nirvana. If you need someone to tell you exactly what to get, skip to the end of this review and I'll list what I got and loooooved.\n\nThis is place is in a great location, close to the harbor, aquarium, etc. but that also means parking will be a pain *dun dun dun!* That doesn't ruin it for me. Nope. Because when I walked in, I loved the urban chic feel and was wowed by the gorgeous array of fixin's just waiting for me to order them. There are standard menu items (AKA you can order an Asian chicken salad) or you can create your own masterpiece. I am in favor of playing God with my food, though, and created something just right for me.\n\nThat brings me to an important point: KIDS! This was great for my preschool aged kids, who were really psyched to choose their own adventure with dinner. For $5 they got a generous helping of noodles with their choice of any of those bazillion toppings, plus chips, plus a juice box. They put together some funky combinations (egg noodles, grilled chicken, shredded carrots, corn, grapes, apples, and chicken broth?), but they ate them enthusiastically.\n\nBottom line, it's a fantastic deal to eat here. I got my money's worth and felt GREAT after eating my food. All the stars. All of them.\n\n(My specific order if you want to try it: Brown rice bowl with grilled chicken. My greens were half spring mix and half arugula. Toppings: black beans, a sprinkle of jalape\u00f1o, corn, cilantro, quinoa, wheat berries, pumpkin seeds, and parmesan shavings topped with a cilantro vinaigrette + chicken broth and tomato broth.)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-15T06:44:02-0500", "location_id": "3782543", "id": "332980408", "user": {"username": "Caitlin D", "user_location": {"name": "LA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Fresh Bowls and Salads, Eager Staff", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d3782543-r332949092-m11068-Nalley_Fresh-Baltimore_Maryland.html#review332949092", "text": "My one complaint is that i should have kept a closer eye on how my Asian Bowl was being prepared.
