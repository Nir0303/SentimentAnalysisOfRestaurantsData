The menu changes regularly (every few months), so it's hard to recommend items beyond the normal comfort foods - ribs, boneless wings, etc.  Their happy hour specials are an easy way to get some tasty bites without going full force for a meal. Their beers on tap are currently good, as the Sam Adams Oktoberfest is on tap.  They usually DON'T have a good darker beer on tap, so it's nice when there is one. Parking is easy at the big lot next to the theater, but on the weekends it may be tougher.  There's a lot to do in this part of Alhambra, and Applebee's is close to everything, so it's an excellent starting/meeting point.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-30T18:30:13-0400", "location_id": "4540291", "id": "423965257", "user": {"username": "RangerBobN", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Accomadating staff.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29078-d4540291-r398676287-m11068-Applebee_s-Alhambra_California.html#review398676287", "text": "Party of 6 three adults and three children, needed high chairs for them.
