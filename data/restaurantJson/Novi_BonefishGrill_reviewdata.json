I had a $50 gift certificate so I was looking forward to a nice dinner on someone else. The waiter seemed like he was in a hurry to get rid of me. I ordered from their 3 course set menu and added an appetizer. The appetizer came quickly and before I had a chance to eat a bite of it my salad was also at the table. Within 3 minutes my filet was also at the table. It was overwhelming and not the relaxed dinning experience I was looking for. My filet was very fatty, I questioned if it was in fact filet mignon. I asked for a box for my leftovers and the waiter tried to bring me my dessert in a to-go box. I told him I wanted to eat it then and he seemed put off. He also asked me pretty snarkily if I wanted ANOTHER ice tea. Overall, if I was spending my money, I wouldn't come back.

Ordered walleye and shrimp, they were both hammered, so over cooked.  My wife's steak was cooked perfectly medium rare.  It only took about 5 minutes or so to get napkins and utensils after the food came. Would have been nice to eat while the food was still hot.  Ordered the coconut pie for dessert, but the waiter chose to bring us the bill instead.  We could have complained, but decided to just write the place off for the future.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-29T14:09:49-0400", "location_id": "1105682", "id": "398972867", "user": {"username": "Detroittraveler250", "user_location": {"name": "Detroit, Michigan", "id": "42139"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Not as good as expected", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42538-d1105682-r398828707-m11068-Bonefish_Grill-Novi_Michigan.html#review398828707", "text": "Tried to come here by myself on a business trip on a weeknight and they told me it would be a 30 minute wait even though I was a 1 person party.

Tonight's dinner was less than that. We had reservations for 6:15 pm and the restaurant was not busy. Our waiter didn't arrive at our table for 15 minutes, even though he served two other tables that arrived after us. Our waiter spent so much time at the table next to us, we attempted to to get some attention multiple times. Example: we waited 15 more minutes to get \"hot\" bread while other tables were served with hot bread. Our meals came an hour after we sat down.  We were given the excuse multiple times that \"someone called in.\" The fish, this evening's featured special, was excessively dry.  So dry, my first mouthful scratched my throat; potatoes were swimming in butter.  We will not sit in this waiter's area, again.  Thanks to the manager for listening to our feelings of being treated like second class citizens.
