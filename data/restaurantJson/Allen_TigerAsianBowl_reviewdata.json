The good thing were we got free california roll for check in via yelp, and also the server was very friendly and informative.

The first clue that this wasn't going to go well was the place was completely empty on a Saturday, and we were there a good 10 minutes before anyone came in behind us.  The 40 minutes we were there, I'd say about 5 other people came through.  My wife and I ordered the beef terryaki bowl, and we both commented that it would've been good to actually see pictures of the different dishes.  My point of reference would be Genghis Grill where you can see what you're getting.  My wife also ordered sushi, which the guy advised was brought in from a different restaurant?  So, our food came pretty quickly, but the portion seemed really small based on what I paid.  Again for reference I could've paid $20 at Genghis Grill for 2 drinks, 2 bowls, and ice cream.  I paid roughly $40 for 2 bowls, 1 drink, and sushi.  I made quick work of my beef terryaki bowl, but my wife and I both noticed there was a ton of sauce once I got to the bottom, so I was worried they'd use the sauce to mask something.  My worries were justified the next morning when I woke up with stomach cramps.  My wife argued it couldn't have been the food because she didn't have the same symptoms, but she had eaten the sushi and took her terryaki bowl to go.  She ate her terryaki bowl a few hours after me, so sure enough her symptoms kicked in a few hours after mine.
