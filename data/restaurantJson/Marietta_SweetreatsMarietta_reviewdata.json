We were right near Sweetreats so the timing seemed perfect! \n\n    The place was crowded (always a good sign) and the menu was quite tempting with so many unique flavors to choose from. \n\n     The first counter we saw contained plates of unappealing pieces of fudge on an old, dirty peeling shelf. (See photos.) I then looked around and noticed the whole place appeared unkempt and not that clean. As a Southern Mama Bear, I immediately suggested to the family that we leave and find another ice cream shop, but I was outvoted. \ud83d\ude23 (I look around for their Health Code Score, but didn't see it posted.) \n\n     So we got on line. There were 5-6 teenagers behind the counter busy doing things like sorting cones and working the mixer, but only ONE of them was taking orders despite the crowd.\n\n     My husband (who owns/runs a business - not ice cream related) commented that their service style was clearly inefficient and disorganized. He also remarked that the sight of the chaos \ud83d\ude28 stressed him out. \"I'd never be able to sleep or even relax knowing that my business was being run by teenagers!\" \n\n     Still, the family's desire to try their ice cream outweighed the negatives. The Flavors Selection was huge and they sounded so enticing: Thin Mint, Nutella Cheesecake, Banana Pudding - just to name a few. (We limited everyone to a single cup or cone, not wanting to take too much of a risk.) \n\n      The ice cream did taste exactly as described and was full of flavor. Nevertheless, we will NOT return. The cleanliness of the shop was a real concern. For a similar sweet treat in a bright, clean, well-run, reputable ice cream shop - I would choose Cold Stone over Sweetreats Marietta any day.
