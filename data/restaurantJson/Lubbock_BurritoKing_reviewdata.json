Burrito King makes a great burrito!  There are several types you can get, including: barbacoa, carne guisada (beef or pork), carnitas, chicharon, ground beef, tripas, chicken fajita, al pastor, beef fajita, asada, brisket, lebgua, and carnitas verdes (not listed on the menu, but it's there). My favorite is the ground beef with rice and avacado added.  My second favorite is the carnitas verdes.  It has a nice kick from the green chiles.  They also have tortas and full Mexican dishes.  I've never been here for breakfast, but I hear good things about their breakfast burritos.  The salsa has a good amount of heat, but good flavor as well.\n\nThe restaurant has about 20 tables for seating, but you can also just order at the window when you walk in if you want something to go.  There is also a drive through if you don't feel like walking in. They are only open for breakfast and lunch (7am-3pm)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-29T10:21:34-0400", "location_id": "10246499", "id": "368769124", "user": {"username": "BarryBroughton", "user_location": {"name": "Lubbock, Texas", "id": null}}}]}
