Check out the walls hung with little tin stoves and refrigerators that children used to play with long ago.  It'll make you smile.\nBut the food is modern and healthful and delicious.\nMy daughter and I had a salad with a divine dressing and a smoked brisket sandwich with sauerkraut and cheese.  I think the sauerkraut was made in house.  Excellent.\nI think the chef is the same one who made flourless chocolate cake in another location we ate at once.  That was so wonderful she should do it again at this place.\nI heard this was a bagel place, but it is much more than that.  We loved the place and the food.  \nIf we get back to Fargo, we know where we will have lunch--at BernBaum's!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-25T19:33:09-0400", "location_id": "10304423", "id": "410827510", "user": {"username": "LASS4", "user_location": {"name": "Bismarck, North Dakota", "id": "49709"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Funky Vibes & Great Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49785-d10304423-r377341127-m11068-BernBaum_s-Fargo_North_Dakota.html#review377341127", "text": "Chef Andrea Baumgardner has done it again.
