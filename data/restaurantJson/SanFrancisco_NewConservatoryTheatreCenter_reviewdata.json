It was very well performed, with serious tones and light humor as well.  Birds of a Feather is about a gay penguin couple and gay marriage. The Paula Zahn digression was a bit weak, but on balance a good story and entertaining evening.\n\nIt opens this weekend (late May) and runs for several weeks.  Don't miss it if you are nearby!\n\nAnd, the lineup for the New Conservatory Theatre Center looks good, whatever the season.  I'd always check it out for a SF visit.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-05-26T11:50:56-0400", "location_id": "2442472", "id": "161909948", "user": {"username": "Nancy2005", "user_location": {"name": "Brookline, Massachusetts", "id": "60823"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2011-12", "title": "Very welcoming small theatre", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d2442472-r125426281-m11068-New_Conservatory_Theatre_Center-San_Francisco_California.html#review125426281", "text": "I believe this is a non-profit theatre which puts any money made into training underprivileged children in drama.
