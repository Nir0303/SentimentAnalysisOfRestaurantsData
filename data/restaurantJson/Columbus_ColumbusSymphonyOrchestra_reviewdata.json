I attended 4 of the Columbus Symphony Orchestra's 7 concerts last season and I enjoyed each of them thoroughly.  Each of the concerts had a unique theme and Conductor George Del Gobo did a nice job of balancing popular, crowd pleasing pieces of music with less frequently heard and very interesting music.  As I understand it, the symphony pulls talented musicians from all over Georgia and Alabama for each concert which, I believe, contributes to the quality of the ensemble- an ensemble you would expect to find in a much larger city.  If you are attending one of the \"Masterworks\" series concerts, be sure to arrive early so that you can hear Maestro Del Gobo's orientation to the concert which he calls \"Know the Score.\"  During these orientations, Del Gobo provides concert goers with cues to listen for in the music, an explanation of the historical context of many of the pieces, and answers questions from the audience.  Del Gobo is intimately familiar with all of the pieces the orchestra plays so his notes on cues, moments, and textures within the music are fascinating but these informal orientations are most remarkable for the historical context he provides for each piece- the man has virtually encyclopedic knowledge of music history.  I would reccomend the CSO to any and all music lovers living in or visiting the Chattahoochee Valley.  Final note: children's tickets to the concerts are only $5, but families with young children who need to be in bed before the end of a concert or who may not sit so well through an entire concert can also attend the orchestra's rehearsals held the day of the concert at 12:30 PM.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-06-17T13:06:13-0400", "location_id": "7735869", "id": "280973609", "user": {"username": "JustTryingtoHelp15", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Music City Hit Makers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34859-d7735869-r275337337-m11068-Columbus_Symphony_Orchestra-Columbus_Georgia.html#review275337337", "text": "I visited the Orchestra for their collaboration with the Music City Hit Makers back on Feb. 14th, 2015.
