My last visit was two weekends ago; we got there at about 6pm and there was barely any place to sit, not because the place was full, but it was dirty, tables had not been cleared and it seemed they had been there for a very long time. Apparently, they had a problem with the air conditioning and they had a small fan for the whole restaurant. Even though there were only 3 or 4 other tables, it took them a while to approach us. Our waitress was quite nice, but just assumed we knew Mexican food (no recommendation whatsoever), so we ordered the fiesta platter (what I always order); this platter as a sampler has one of each (sorry I can never remember their names!) it's about $10 and it's definitely a big portion, it used to be delicious and you could tell the difference, now it all tastes the same, it took them quite a while to serve us too. It is a cheap restaurant and food used to be really good. Unfortunately, they haven't moved on with the times, and food is only average, I would even dare say another Taco Bell, which is absolutely not good at all to me.\nThe whole restaurant looked unkept and dirty, no one cares about the place, let alone the costumer. When you are done, they give you the check and you have to go and pay yourself at the register. \nThis restaurant has been opened for ages now and they still don't have a liquor license; you can take your liquor, fair enough, but the one thing you crave when having Mexican food is a margarita.\nIt really is a shame how disappointing this place has turned.
