She raved about the juice, but my son said the smoothie (which looked great) tasted like water. My friend tried it and, sure enough, it was incredibly bland. We send it back and asked for juice instead. \n\nThe server brought us a second try at the mango smoothie, but it was still bland (as my friend confirmed after my son tried it). They then brought mango juice, which my son really enjoyed. Just as we were preparing to leave, the server brought out a third mango smoothie for my son to try, and this time it was a hit! Turns out more yogurt and honey did the trick.\n\nI am very impressed with the server's dedication to providing a quality experience. Most would have just brought us the juice and not pursued the smoothie issue any further. We left with an excellent smoothie in hand (no charge). This is our third or fourth time at the Jefferson and they never disappoint!

The hostess was great, very welcoming, walked us to the bar for a drink before dinner, then very cheerfully back to the restaurant when it was time to be seated.  The bartender was very friendly, too.\n\nThe 3-course holiday dinner for $102 included starter, entree, and dessert.  We started dinner with the cleverly presented beet puzzle salad, different colored beets cut into jigsaw puzzle form.  The flavor was nothing special, just nice cold pieces of beet.  All 3 of us ordered turkey and dressing.  The turkey seemed to be lightly pan-fried and was brownish, chewy and devoid of flavor.  The stuffing seemed to have been baked in a loaf and cut into round slices like english muffins or hockey pucks.  It, too, didn't have much flavor.  There was some other roundish piece of dark food on my plate which I wasn't sure was a) turkey, b) dressing or c) none of the above so I skipped it.  For dessert we each had the combo apple and pumpkin pie dish, which, was fair if nothing special.\n\nOur server was aloof but efficient and managed to smile when it got close to tip time.\n\nBetween the bar and dinner we shared two bottles of chardonnay, at $72 a bottle one of the least expensive on the wine list.\n\nTotal cost of dinner, wine and tips for the 3 of us exceeded $600.  For this we got food we didn't particularly care for with indifferent service, and in a hotel lobby restaurant, not in the restaurant we thought we had booked.
