There are always very nice art works on display in other parts of the old courthouse.  The museum has a room to themselves on the first floor.  The displays change every 4-6 months.  All of the displays are of some historical significance to the county.  There have been some great displays about the Civil War, the oldest churches in the area and the present display about long time school teachers in the county.  Definitely worth a visit if your are a history nut.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-23T12:58:11-0400", "location_id": "8560080", "id": "409674499", "user": {"username": "Mongo1234", "user_location": {"name": "Concord, NC", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Fun for art lovers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49049-d8560080-r406836911-m11068-Historic_Cabarrus_Association_Inc_The_Concord_Museum-Concord_North_Carolin.html#review406836911", "text": "I have been here a few times now.  I usually visit when it is the art walk and it is really pretty inside.  There is a lot of art work as in paintings, photography, pottery etc.  So far it has been mostly modern art which I am not a fan of but it is done by all local people and so it is a great way to support local arts, which I am all about!\n \n A few years back my mother in law and myself went during an art walk to view a free movie they were showing at this location.  If you go upstairs there is a big old theater and it was a lot of fun.  I believe they hold concerts and comedians come and magicians. \n\n Also on the plus side is that it is free to get in! Great for the family. Maybe not little kids due to the pottery that they have sitting out and the paintings on the walls.
