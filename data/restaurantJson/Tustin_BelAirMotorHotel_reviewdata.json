This vintage motel is a flashback of my visits to the Howard Johnson motels back in the 60s. This kitchenette suite was rented for me while I was visiting my family in Tustin, CA. The towels were fluffed upon request, while the toiletries were plentiful. The retro kitchenette was very clean and everything worked well. The bedroom was spacious had plenty of privacy for you and your significant other. The main room had a very comfortable futon, which would act as a luxury couch during family movie time and then later turn into a cozy bed for your admired children. I had plenty of closet space and hangers for my apparel and a lot of room my for my refrigerated goods in the mini fridge. The Bel Air Motor Motel is pet friendly, they even provided my dog with proper bedding. There is a park across the street, in which provided a safe playing environment for my two children. Convenient location for your next Disneyland trip. Your kids will fall in LOVE this hot spot!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-02-14T18:16:00-0500", "location_id": "271587", "id": "152149354", "user": {"username": "Belinda F", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2013-01", "title": "The worst hotel/motel I have ever stayed at!!!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33198-d271587-r151980896-m11068-Bel_Air_Motor_Hotel-Tustin_California.html#review151980896", "text": "This was the worst place I have ever stayed at.

The manager appears to work alone, beside the maid. There is no receptionist, phone calls to the front desk go unanswered, if you need something at night, you're out of luck! There is no security here either. I must add that this time we stayed in the hotel lobby building. The parking lot building is a lot nicer, has kitchenettes & we never saw any roaches when we stayed there a couple years back. The bathroom there gave us no problem. Manager yells a lot for no reason, she yelled at my girlfriend who came back in tears as she had to ask for assistance after 9pm & the manager yelled at her.
