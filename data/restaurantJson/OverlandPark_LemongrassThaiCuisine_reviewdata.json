This restaurant didn't disappoint.  The Hot & Sour soup was home made - not the gelatinous goop you sometimes get.  The broth was clear and thin and the soup was chock full of ingredients.  Delicious!\n\nEveryone at my table enjoyed their entrees which included yellow curry, Paad Thai, Cashew Chicken and my dish of Khao Nam, a fab Loas crispy rice salad.  Yummy.\n\nThis restaurant is located in old downtown Overland Park so is a great add-on to a visit to the Farmers Market, a concert at the outdoor pavilion or a movie in the old fashioned movie theater, Rio.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-07T05:07:20-0400", "location_id": "6603346", "id": "214071713", "user": {"username": "Maureen P", "user_location": {"name": "Overland Park, Kansas", "id": "38969"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Welcome to amazing Thai", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38969-d6603346-r204283141-m11068-Lemongrass_Thai_Cuisine-Overland_Park_Kansas.html#review204283141", "text": "This place opened in Old Overland Park a few months ago and my wife and I decided to give it a try. We'd heard good things from friends. Kansas City has had a long history of mostly average Thai food, so we are always on the look out for something new.  In one word: WOW.\n\nWe generally judge all things Thai on two dishes - red curry and pad thai. We were there for red curry night (Monday) and were not disappointed. The vegetables used were fresh (not canned), the rice was perfect and the curry sauce was the best we've had in Kansas City. The pad thai was also perfect. It's a nice looking space, the service was fast and the price was about average for Kansas City.\n\nIf you love Thai and you're in KC, give it a shot.
