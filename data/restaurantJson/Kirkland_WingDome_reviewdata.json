The wings were standard , nothing so special to have a restaurant named after them.  The cheeseburger was tasteless ( frozen thin burger?). The waffle fries ( I think they called them Chips?) were soggy and Luke warm.  My Shrimp Po-boy was ok.  I enjoyed the spicy batter, and my fries had a bad oil taste to them.   I'd have to say we did not complain not giving them a chance to compensate us by fixing our complaints.  We just weren't in the mood to complain to the lovely waitress that was very competent and it wasn't her fault.   Plus at this point we weren't hungry enough to order a new meal.
