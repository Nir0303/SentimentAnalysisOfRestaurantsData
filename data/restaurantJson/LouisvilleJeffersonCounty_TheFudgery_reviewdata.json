They had a number of different varieties of fudge available. After tasting a few we settled on 1. Only 1 simply because they are about 1/2 lb or more each. That's a lot of fudge. We watched them making 2 different types right behind the counter while we were deciding which one to get. Interesting! The 3 staff were very friendly and spent some time with us describing the different varieties and how they made them. The facility itself could have been a little cleaner but that probably was the result of a number of people who came thru just before us. It was as good fudge as I have had.
