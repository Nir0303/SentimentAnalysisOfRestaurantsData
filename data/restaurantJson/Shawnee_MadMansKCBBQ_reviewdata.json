I attempted to contact them via phone but did not reach them as it went to voice mail. I decided to go ahead and check out the restaurant without ordering ahead. I drove by it the first time but finally was able to find it. I went in, and was greeted with some pretty unassuming decoration and needed to hit a door bell to alert them I was there, perhaps because they also do catering and were attending to it. I had a brisket sandwich, which was cooked just like I would hope. Not falling apart, but not tough. It was also very flavorful and went down good. As I mentioned, they do catering and I think have a food truck so they seem like they may be just getting started with a physical location based upon the doorbell order system and the fact that the person at the counter was also attending to her children. This did not take away from the place, because the service was fast, very friendly and the food was great. If you eat here you will get a good BBQ meal. I would definitely recommend it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-07T19:53:52-0400", "location_id": "10458049", "id": "380717775", "user": {"username": "joshua b", "user_location": {"name": "Olathe, Kansas", "id": "38954"}}}]}
