Bedsides the large bar/restaurant area, there is a large upstairs that you can sit at, however there was no music or TV's upstairs to listen to or watch.  There is also the large patio outside that is well taken care of and hides the main street view. Food for our fundraiser: large salad that looked good, the wings were very good, mild spice and BBQ, 3 different types of  thin crust pizza, and rigatoni with nice melted cheese on top.  Considering that this was a fundraiser, the food was pretty good and readily replenished for everyone.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-11-01T06:51:10-0400", "location_id": "6372486", "id": "237400629", "user": {"username": "gcg3refs", "user_location": {"name": "North Royalton, Ohio", "id": "50780"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Neighborhood Pub With Good Grub!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g50207-d6372486-r235016757-m11068-Tradesman_Tavern-Cleveland_Ohio.html#review235016757", "text": "Tradesman's Tavern had that  typical Ohio neighborhood pub feel to it, but roomy because it's a good size place. Choose to sit on a bar stool at the large bar in the center of the room or at one of several  tables all around. There is also a nice size outdoor patio with its own bar. Servers are friendly. Prices are really beyond reasonable!\nWhat's anything but typical is the food.  This is better than regular \"bar food\".  A house side salad is plentifully served on a dinner plate & was really nice - not just bagged lettuce tossed on a plate. I ordered the wings - 10 for $5 and they were tasty, moist & meaty.  Several different rubs to choose from & the garlic parmesan was a good choice. Friends ordered the burgers & all were happy. \nDrinks also reasonably priced. All in all its a good place for friends to meet & enjoy without spending a fortune.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-18T07:20:34-0400", "location_id": "6372486", "id": "235016757", "user": {"username": "CharlaAV711", "user_location": {"name": "Anaheim, California", "id": "29092"}}}]}
