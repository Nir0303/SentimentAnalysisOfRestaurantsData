By the way..the olive oil was very fresh and flavorful, I only wish we had some decent bread to go along with it.  AND...this was the first impression...not the best.  The Greek salad was good...but please, can you splurge on more than two olives? I mean, really, olives are a BIG difference between a \"salad\" and a \"Greek salad\".  It is very obvious that you \"count\" your olives.  Throw five or six olives, a peppereronci and more Feta cheese on a Greek salad!  This left another \"bad taste\" in our mouth.  Then the entree was served.  It was really tasty!  Very good salmon...not overcooked.  The shrimp were very good as well.  And it is correct..the Marsala sauce is great.  I would return to this restaurant, but my advice to the chef is: don't set people up with \"so so\" before you serve your specialty because by then, they have already formed some of their opinion.

The food, staff, atmosphere, price and overall experience was great.  I had Shrimp on a Skewer with veggies and it was very delicious.  The price $7.00  (I think) and the portion was just right for lunch.  No complaints at all and I would certainly go back when I'm in that area.  Highly recommend this establishment.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-09T10:03:17-0400", "location_id": "7180085", "id": "308586604", "user": {"username": "patsy d", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}]}
