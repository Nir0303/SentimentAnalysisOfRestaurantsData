The prices for drinks were pretty reasonable and the music selection from the DJ was definitely meant for an older crowd as he mixed some old school in. I loved it as I'm a bit older and love the 90's jams. So why only 4 stars? They don't have a dance floor so it was a bit weird with people just dancing anywhere by their tables. It also took away from the energy of having people packed into 1 area to really dance. If they add a floor somewhere and maybe some lights, I might change it to 5 stars.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-14T18:55:44-0400", "location_id": "6649029", "id": "205611653", "user": {"username": "liquidmj", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}]}
