Located at 934 Georgia Avenue, atop Coleman Hill in downtown Macon, the Hay House is an 18,000-square-foot, 24-room palace that was designed by New York architect T. Thomas and Son and built in part by craftsmen and artisans brought from Italy. Built between 1855 and 1859 by William Butler Johnston, who obtained his wealth by investing in banks, railroads and public utilities rather than cotton, the house is built in the Italian Renaissance Revival style and includes four levels crowned by a three-story cupola. Often described as the \"Palace of the South,\" it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 for its architectural uniqueness. Its technological amenities were unsurpassed in the mid-19th century--hot and cold running water, central heating, a speaker-tube system connecting 15 rooms, an 8,000-gallon water tank, a French lift equivalent to today's elevator, an in-house kitchen and an elaborate ventilation system. Two families lives in the house, the first over four generations. But most of today's furnishings date from the Hay family's occupancy from 1926 to 1962. A few pieces date to the Johnston family (1860 to 1896), most notably the Eastlake-style dining room suite, which includes the 1857 marble statue, \"Ruth Gleaning,\" by American expatriate sculptor Randolph Rogers. After Mrs. Johnston died in 1896, her daughter Mary Ellen and her husband, Judge William H. Felton, lived in the house until 1926. They remodeled and redecorated parts of the house, updated the plumbing and added electricity. After the deaths of the Feltons, the house was sold to Parks Lee Hay and his wife. They redecorated the entire house, updating it to fit the new 20th century decor. In 1977, the ownership and operation of the house was formally transferred to The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation. Today, it is open for daily tours and renovations continue to keep Hay House up to date.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-12T10:17:44-0400", "location_id": "102963", "id": "417547530", "user": {"username": "Taylor B", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Exquiste display of the wealthy past", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60920-d102963-r416967488-m11068-Hay_House-Macon_Georgia.html#review416967488", "text": "The 500 pound front door will amaze you because they are so easy to open.
