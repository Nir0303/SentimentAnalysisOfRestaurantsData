Great smaller shows at their 5th St theatre, the Trinity Center (housed inside an repurposed 19th century church) is a wonderful and intimate playhouse for smaller shows or dinner theatre. The Empress is a converted movie theater and Goldie's variety show venue that was incredibly popular in it's heyday.
