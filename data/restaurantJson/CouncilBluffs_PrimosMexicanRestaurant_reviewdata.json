When they first opened I figured \"Great\" I'd have a close establishment to patronize. So the first time I ordered the Emilio's special to-go. They said it would take 25 to 30 min before I could Pick it up. I waited 25 minutes to pick it up and once I arrived, I sat there another 10 min waiting for anyone to acknowledge my presence. There was only one other party dining in there. I called over the bar tender, as I was sitting at the bar without being asked if I wanted something to drink, and asked how long before my order would be ready, he acted like I just took away his best friend, he was not happy. Then he hung up the phone and brought my order to me then rang it up and never even said thank you or you're welcome when I thanked him. I got home and the food was cold. It was nasty. The burrito was flavorless and the beans were bland. I swore I would never patronize that establishment again.\nThen yesterday my husband and I decided to just go out for a drink and My husband figured how could they screw up a bottle of beer so we went to Primos since it was close by. We walked in and the waitress asked if there was just two in the party and we said yes and we would just sit at the bar. She continued to the next customers. We sat directly in front of the bar tender, who was chatting and laughing with a friend on the phone. He didn't acknowledge us at all. We sat there for almost 10 minutes with him just enjoying his conversation on the phone. So I suggested loudly to my husband that we should go to Applebees instead where we could get some service. He didn't even flinch and continued talking on the phone. I wouldn't step foot in that place again if you paid me.

The place was mostly empty and the hostess/waitress told us to sit where ever we liked. By the time we finished there were only a few empty tables. \nWait staff was friendly and efficient.  We ordered drinks and then after we got those my wife asked for a large order of chips and salsa which was listed on the menu. The waitress said something like \"you'll get those included. I just haven't gotten around to it yet\". I found this an odd thing to say but she was back in a few minutes with the chips. \nI ordered the beef chimichanga which came with refried beans. The food arrived at the table hot and in a timely manner.  The ground beef was a bit bland. My teen son ordered the same thing and thought it was spiced properly so maybe it was just me. The refried beans had a bit of a smoky taste to them which was different but tasted good. \nThe consensus from the group was the tacos were the best. Fried shells and good fresh fillings. \nThe main reason I don't plan to come back is the atmosphere. Primos is located in a former convience store. It's loud and hard to have a conversation with your neighbors.  They have a \"juke box\" which was extremely loud. My wife asked them if they could turn it down and a few minutes later, during a lull in the music, I overhead a lady at the next table complain as well. The waitress said \"she said she already turned it down but I'll ask again.\" \nBesides the loud music the air quality was poor. We came out of the restaurant reeking of the smell of grease.  \nThey have a bar that extends the full length of the back wall. We didn't have any alcohol so I can't comment on the selection.  \nPrimos food is adequate but you can find better in Council Bluffs.
