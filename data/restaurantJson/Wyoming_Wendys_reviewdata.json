The person taking the order must have been new as the accuracy of this order was not good . The delivery of our food took more than 10 minutes . One sandwich was not correct, the fries were cold, one kids meal didn't have a toy, the frosty ordered was not delivered. I fought the most important things but if I had done a drive thru this would have been a disaster . Please be sure to double check your order before leaving the counter or window and don't come with small children.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-13T01:22:56-0400", "location_id": "4883290", "id": "382088696", "user": {"username": "fourbeesplus3", "user_location": {"name": "Grand Rapids, MI", "id": null}}}]}
