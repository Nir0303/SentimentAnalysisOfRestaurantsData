We stayed in the hummingbird which is a one bedroom with kitchenette , living room and bathroom. All the rooms were updated. The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have the separate space for watching tv.  Free wifi was great and didn't cut out like at some hotels. The kitchenette was great for making our own breakfast. You could do other meals as well but we chose to eat out. This place was super clean. Walking distance to Many restaurants,shops and the new rail station (opening soon). We stayed for 5 days and had no issues. Will definitely stay again if we are ever back in the area!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-01T02:19:02-0400", "location_id": "8826773", "id": "433484904", "user": {"username": "Vehowe", "user_location": {"name": "New Brunswick, Canada", "id": "154956"}}}]}
