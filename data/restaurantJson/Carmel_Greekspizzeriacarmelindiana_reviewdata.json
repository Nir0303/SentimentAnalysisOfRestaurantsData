And, of course, your favorite toppings make for a perfect pizza experience.\n\nThis location has limited seating indoors and outside but, interestingly, you can get a pizza \"to go\" and take it across the street to the craft pub and order a microbrew to enjoy with your pizza (or salad or breadsticks...all are available on the menu).\n\nWe have two pizza restaurants in our neighborhood, with very different styles and which I crave on different occasions.
