A banner above the museum door said \"Picasso, Chagall, Matisse, Miro.\" \"In Loveland???\" I wondered. In I went. Admission to the museum is free but the special art exhibit cost $5 for entry. I paid it quickly and inside I found a private collection of great art on display with easily more than 100 unique pieces of artwork and sculpture by these great artists plus Dali (my personal favorite). This is a limited exhibition, so go now. The rest of the museum is also pretty interesting with artifacts documenting early life in Loveland plus a section on GW Sugar.
