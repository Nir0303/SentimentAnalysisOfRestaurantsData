The restaurant is located on El Camino about 200 feet from the busiest intersection in Sunnyvale -where the 8 lane El Camino Real (6 lanes and 2 left turn lanes) meets the 10 lane Mathilda (6 lanes, 2 left turn lanes, two right turn lanes) at a traffic light intersection.  \n\nThe problem is that there is no right turn lane on east bound El Camino Real toward south Mathilda -the only direction on the four corner intersection without a right turn lane.  So traffic in that right lane backs up, and up, well beyond the Chick Fil A., waiting for the light to turn green.  Often you cannot leave the parking lot, until a car on El Camino stops to come into the lot.  \n\nThere's only one way into the Chick Fil A parking lot, and one way out, and that's right on that backed up El Camino Real right lane.  So getting in and getting out of the parking lot is a nightmare during eating hours, particularly at dinner time.   And the parking lot itself holds maybe 60 vehicles, while the capacity of the restaurant is in the hundreds.  \n\nThe place is clean, crowded, and with fast service.\n\nWe walked there from our house, going to the Sunnyvale library first,  and ordered one of their famous or infamous $3.50 spicy chicken sandwiches, and an overpriced $8 Chinese chicken salad.  The salad is good, with chicken and mandarins mixed in with the iceberg lettuce.     \n\nThe $3.50 spicy chicken sandwich seems overpriced for what you get - a breaded fillet of chicken on a kaiser roll with lettuce and tomato.  Granted it tastes very good, but $3.50 for a chicken sandwich, when In and Out Hamburgers are $1.80?\n\nThey also have a children's play area with various playground equipment right next to the eating area in a separate room, visible from the eating area.\n\nAs we leave the restaurant, cars wait to leave the packed parking lot, while an endless stream of cars on El Camino rolls by and comes to a standstill waiting for the light to turn green, trapping the parking lot cars.\n\nAnd if you are thinking of parking in the Fidelity Investments Parking Lot on Mathilda, two doors down, there is a sign at the entrance stating \"No chick-fil-a parking -tow away'.

All they have is chicken, but there is a wide variety of items from chicken strips, to chicken salad sandwiches, and even chicken soup. I got the cobb salad and it was very good. A large selection of dressings to choose from. My husband and kids got the strips. Lots of dipping sauces to choose from as well. Very polite servers that constantly check in on you. Not my favorite place for dinner since the menu is so limited, but I will be back for a lunch salad.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-11-18T11:28:19-0500", "location_id": "5452222", "id": "185118060", "user": {"username": "gradeschoolmom", "user_location": {"name": "Sunnyvale, California", "id": "33146"}}}, {"lang": "zhTW", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "\u6211\u5011\u6700\u611b\u7684\u7f8e\u5f0f\u5feb\u9910", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33146-d5452222-r400228582-m11068-Chick_fil_A_Sunnyvale-Sunnyvale_California.html#review400228582", "text": "\u8d85\u7f8e\u5473\u96de\u5821\uff0c\u9023\u6d77\u68c9\u5bf6\u5bf6\u90fd\u6703\u653e\u68c4\u7f8e\u5473\u87f9\u5821\uff01\u6211\u6700\u611b\u96de\u8089\u6c99\u62c9\uff0c\u7c21\u55ae\u852c\u679c\u914d\u4e0a\u73fe\u70b8\u96de\u584a\uff0c\u7f8e\u5473\u53c8\u5065\u5eb7\u3002\u96de\u584a\u5152\u7ae5\u9910\u4efd\u91cf\u525b\u525b\u597d\uff0c\u5b69\u5b50\u8d85\u611b\uff01\u62db\u724c\u96de\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\uff0c\u8abf\u5473\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u81fa\u7063\u9e79\u9165\u96de\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u7d93\u5178\u6cbe\u91ac\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff01", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-01T21:10:13-0400", "location_id": "5452222", "id": "400228582", "user": {"username": "797joannal", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
