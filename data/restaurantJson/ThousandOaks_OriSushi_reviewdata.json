Ori is an authentic Japanese restaurant. this is the second time visiting since the change of ownership and I feel that it has changed for the better.The sashimi was very fresh and good quality and tempura was done nicely. Another note my experience at Japanese restaurants is meals are always served as made but here the dinner was brought at the same time, made it nice. I will be back. Note: most Japanese restaurants are closed on Mondays, Ori is open 7 days a week!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-07-07T19:21:14-0400", "location_id": "4420118", "id": "166685418", "user": {"username": "zato1", "user_location": {"name": "Simi Valley, California", "id": "33093"}}}]}
