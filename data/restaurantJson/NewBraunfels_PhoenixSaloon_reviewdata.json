I've heard from friends and family it was overrated and not a good place to go. Now I understand why they said this. My boyfriend and I went @ 3:30 on Saturday. When we arrived it was clear they were in the beginning of a huge rush, so we ordered quickly. We got a Frito pie and a chicken sandwich. We each ordered a cocktail and began waiting. We knew it would be longer than usual, but we had no idea we would be receiving our food @ 5:05. That's right, an hour and 35 minutes. I had to go back to work at 5 pm so @4:50 I asked for it Togo. In the time we were waiting we received one refill on our drinks and were never spoken to again. My boyfriend then waited for the food while I went back to work. And what was in the boxes? This ice cream truck excuse of a Frito pie, without the jalepenos or sour cream I paid for, and no cheese!!! My chicken sandwich came with a bag of chips. Now I will mention the manager didn't charge us for the food and took off our second round of drinks. He never came to apologize. No one did. It was insane. No one cared.

The place and history is really neat, you do feel like you have stepped back in time to a degree.  There was live music, a little loud but very good.  They are known for their Chili which is made with sirloin and you can order \"shots\" to make it hotter.  I of course ordered a double shot, everyone else a single.  Then you get to pick toppings.  The Chili is served with Skillet corn bread which was so good we ordered extra!  To top it off they have a really large old bar complete with a bunch of draft beer.  My husband ordered a Guiness and swore it was the best he ever had.  Delicious food, neat place, good music.  We will return and this time with a car load of friends!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-09T10:02:27-0400", "location_id": "2655369", "id": "371518743", "user": {"username": "Shan B", "user_location": {"name": "San Antonio, Texas", "id": "60956"}}}]}
