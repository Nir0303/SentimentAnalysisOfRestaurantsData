They offer the usual Quizno's fare of toasted sandwiches, so if you like it anywhere, you'll like it here too. They do a fine job.\n\nMy disappointment on my most recent visit was a sign announcing that this location no longer accepts coupons. (You can get these by signing up for Quizno's promotional emails.) The coupon says \"participating locations\", which this one used to be. But no more. So if that matters to you, well, there you are.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-16T09:58:17-0400", "location_id": "10749042", "id": "406223350", "user": {"username": "TravelDude95", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}]}
