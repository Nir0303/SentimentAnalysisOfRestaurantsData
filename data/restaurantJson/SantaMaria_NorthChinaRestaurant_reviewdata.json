Recently my wife asked for Chinese food as her lunch choice. Since we were in town, I suggested North China. She ordered Sesame Chicken and I ordered the equivalent of Beef in Spicy Garlic Sauce, a common Chinese entre. Hers was way over seasoned as was mine with none of the subtleness that I have come to expect from well prepared Chinese food. The Sesame Chicken was like none she had ever tasted and I don't mean that in a good way. Mine simply was not spicy and was without a hint of garlic. I have heard this place described as American-Chinese food and I think that is the problem. Some of these dishes hit you over the head. I find the food at Magic Dragon to be miles ahead and very consistent. I love Chinese food so much I hate to give less than a good review but even the Hot and Sour soup has lacked the delicate balance that this dish requires, as though an important ingredient had been left out.
