The menu was large and we had a hard time deciding. We finally decided on 2 rolls, animal style and the Refreshing. Both were fabulous. We loved the citrus flavor of the refreshing. We like to try unique rolls and these were both different from anything we have ever had. My husband always orders seaweed salad whenever we go for sushi and this did not disappoint. The texture was perfect and is had a wonderful sesame flavor. We also had the Hawaiian Ceviche. That was my favorite dish of the night. The fish was in large pieces so you really got the flavor. And I love the coconut milk that added a creaminess. Servers  kept our drinks refilled and checked on us the appropriate amount of times.
