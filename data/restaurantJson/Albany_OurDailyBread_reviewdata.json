The fresh baked goods that are made with care.  Thoughtfully prepared farm to table menu items and organic whenever possible.    Rustic brick walls with a mini farmers market island in the middle of the restaurant and very community orientated establishment.   So you walk into this little downtown jewel, and you are immediately relaxed with the soft sound of Gospel music playing in the background. If you are lucky, a local artist may be strumming their guitar and singing a song or two. I would not recommend the place for a meeting the ceilings are so high you can't hear anyone talking that is not sitting right next to you. Back to the food, the Cuban sandwich was the most popular item on the menu with the folks at the office, and we ordered it on a regular basis.  It was so good we rarely strayed from that choice, but when we did the other menu items were always tasty and fresh.  Fresh pasta and bread with local produce made everything pretty delicious. They sale out of the breakfast items pretty fast so don't waste time get there first thing in the morning.

The turkey on my sandwich was real, sliced turkey and not processed. We had the red velvet cake for dessert and it was fabulous! The server was very friendly and attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.
