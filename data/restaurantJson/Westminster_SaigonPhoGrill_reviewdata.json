Authentic vietnamese food. The restaurant did not look impressive but we were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. The service was a little slow as there were only 2 waitresses but it is worth it! The egg roll were the best I have tried in Colorado as well as the Grilled pork noodle bowl(Bun Heo). The egg roll was crispy and just the right mix of ingredients. Bun Heo was perfect for a hot day, just the right coolness for the noodles, the grilled pork and vegetables. The pho soup was tasty just like those in Vietnam. They have combination rice plates which are for those who need a little heavier lunch.
