They serve homemade ice cream, but in some novel flavors like Merlot, Cornbread and my favorite Lavender and Honey. It was super creamy and rich.  Out of this world good.  It is a little hard to find until you know where to look.  We parked(free) in the deck on High Street across from Crave on Market St.  Then we walked across the street to Maiden Lane where Mocha Maiden is located.  It is clear in the back of the alley on the right.  You can't miss it once you get back there.  One scoop was $2.00 which I found reasonable given the quality of the product.  Staff is super friendly and helpful as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-21T04:02:41-0400", "location_id": "10769408", "id": "408200501", "user": {"username": "Linda K", "user_location": {"name": "Akron, United States", "id": null}}}]}
