But this one was very weird -- the chicken was saut\u00e9ed, which I knew, but then it was  dumped onto the greens and other vegetables, making it a hot dish instead of a salad.  The  vegetables were lettuce and water chestnuts and it was topped with chow mein noodles from a can, and the whole thing was swimming in a huge amount of watery dressing.  The next time I ordered a Mexican salad with black beans -- and again the whole thing was hot!  The beans were hot and then dumped on the vegetables making this a hot meal again.
