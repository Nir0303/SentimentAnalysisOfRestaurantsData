We ambled around town, impressed by the sights.  Saw Villa Di Calabro and thought \"how about a taste and some advice and maybe a map.\"\n\nMike is the owner manager.  6 tastes were $12.  Good pours.  Wines were very good.\n\nMike is proud of the area and knows the wines and viticulture.  He went over the map\nand showed us routes and suggestions based on our wine tastes.  No need nor a stop at the visitor center which we never saw.
