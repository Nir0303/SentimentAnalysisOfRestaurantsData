When we walked in, the atmosphere was pleasant and the air was filled with aromas of spice.  The service was prompt.\n\nI chose the Crispy Rolls as an appetizer and they were delicious!  I had high expectations for the Mussamun Curry, but when it arrived I was disappointed.  The food was bland; not at all what you expect from a Thai restaurant.  As I thought about our ordering experience, I recall that the server did not ask about my preference for the heat of the dish (mild, medium, hot), and it seems they forgot the spice all together.\n\nWe listened to the same repeating track of music for more than 40 minutes.  It wasn't bad music, but it started to get old after about 15 minutes.  \n\nOverall, the restaurant seemed clean and the atmosphere was comfortable, but the food left me feeling disenchanted.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-03-17T20:22:24-0400", "location_id": "3774727", "id": "260243578", "user": {"username": "Misses A", "user_location": {"name": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "id": "60922"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "quality and quantity going down", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32717-d3774727-r210802465-m11068-Honey_Thai_Restaurant-Milpitas_California.html#review210802465", "text": "When they initially started , food and service was really Good.\n\nFood taste is good , but over the time there quantity started getting less and prices went up.\n\nAlso there TO GO Quantity is less.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-06-17T11:27:00-0400", "location_id": "3774727", "id": "210802465", "user": {"username": "Lifeboy007", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Food meh...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32717-d3774727-r197775206-m11068-Honey_Thai_Restaurant-Milpitas_California.html#review197775206", "text": "We went to this restaurant for the first time as we had some coupon.

We stood at the table with the kids waiting for some high chairs, but all the waiters and a chef went to a table to solve a problem at another table. It sounded like they made a mistake on one of their dishes. They kept us waiting for long time holding our kids without any seats.\n\nWe finally got our seats and sat down. The menu was pretty straight forward with your Pad Thai, curries, and other Thai dishes.\n\nWe settled on a Pad Thai, Yellow Curry chicken, and the Roasted Duck.
