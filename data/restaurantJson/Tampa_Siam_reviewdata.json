Upon first glance this quaint establishment seemed closed and further curiousity led me to read the sign and I noticed it was 4 minutes from opening its doors for dinner. At 4:26pm I opened the doors to Si-am for what would become one of the finest service experiences I have had in a long time!\n    The cuisine was impeccable, authentic flavors catered to your palate, personalized dishes for alternative diets such as my friend who was vegan, and most of all a freshness to the food that was savory and unforgettable.\n   Who seemed to be the owner did not introduce himself but he informed us upon ordering that it was his wife in the kitchen and she would be preparing our meals. He was a kind man who was very diligent in making sure our expectations would be met. The type of attention to detail most restaurants could only dream of having.\n   Our server was very courteous and efficient allowing us to sit in a table or booth of our choice and quickly bringing fresh ice water and menus to our table for us to decide our meal. He also did not introduce himself but was a fine server and provided excellent service to our table. We asked for alternatives as we looked for vegan options in their dishes and it was at that point that the first gentleman intervened and clarified exactly what was it that our vegan guest desired. I personally always test a thai place on their curry and asked our server which curry he recommended and what spice level did he feel comfortable with. Our server responded with confident insight on the composition of each curry providing a breakdown of all the different ingredients and tells us that his spice level last time was a \"thai hot\" which was spicy yet tolerable. I agreed to trying this \"panang\" curry at \"thai hot\" based on his recommendation. We also ordered two singha beers which were unbottled in front of us shortly thereafter and poured into chilled glasses. We ordered vegetable spring rolls with the sweet n' sour thai sauce along with a coconut milk soup with tofu and vegetables for my friend. He also ordered a vegan pineapple fried rice which they obliged to substitute all meat and meat products with vegetables and tofu.\n     Upon trying our cold Singha thai beer I went ahead to the bathroom and wash up before dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. The bathroom was simple and clean. It was well ornamented, nothing too tacky or underwhelming. This was a really clean, fresh smelling bathroom with an automatic soap dispenser and paper towels. It was completely stocked and well taken care of. Excellent way to maintain the restroom which speaks volumes for this owner and his staff.\n    When I returned to my table I sat for just a minute when the first dish came to our table, the vegetable spring rolls. They were served in a small white circular plate all perfectly cut in half and presented neatly organized over a cabbage and carrot garnish that gave the appetizer a sophistication far exceeding the standards of most thai restaurants. The texture was that of a crispy outer layer still hot from the kitchen with a soft center of vegetables intertwined with the layers of brittle light doughy goodness. It was a balance of the vegetable's flavors versus the crispy outer shell's linning. The homemade sweet n' sour sauce for the egg rolls was superb. The flavors were tangy, spicy and complex delivering a lot of different tastes in one dipping of your egg roll. These proved to be the perfect appetizer!\n     As for the coconut milk broth that my friend ordered, the presentation was clean and elegant. Sparkling white dishware provided the perfect container for this delicate flavorful broth. I tasted the dish and the lukewarm temperature and milky appearance gave it a \"vich soi\" type of experience. I tasted lemon, basil, coconut milk, pepper, tofu, cucumber, onion, and a hint of thai curry amongst the presence of a soy component. It was light and refreshing. The milky white liquid glowed in the dish and served to be a fine appetizer my friend enjoyed.\n    During our appetizers we were visited once again by the owner who wanted to ensure the spice level for the vegan dish was correct. I thought this was a very nice touch and one my friend would appreciate. I was extremely impressed with the service at this restaurant once again, both by the owner and his staff. As a senior contributor here at trip advisor I thought this was a restaurant truly worthy of 5 stars.\n     Now for the main dishes. I will start off by saying the owner himself brought out both of the main courses. I had the panang curry with chicken. The dish was brought out once again in sparkling white dishware with the curry having a dried chili garnish encrusted in the middle of the chicken and vegetable frenzy all held together by rich curry reminiscent of an orange hue. I also noticed the other part of my meal was a \"heart\" of jasmine rice with carrot and cabbage as a garnish on top of the heart both served in round dishes. I will begin by saying the jasmine rice was light, fluffy, the water used was clean which in turn gave the rice a clean flavor without the need of any salt or condiment. The beautiful heart shape housed a nice hot mound of sticky white rice that perfectly paired with my curry. I found myself asking for more of this healthy starch easily addictive from its distinct flavor and light texture.\n   As for the curry, I felt there was an excellent balance of the spice level to the dish that kept it from being overwhelmingly spicy and that allowed you to taste and enjoy the rich cuts of carrots, onions, and chicken as well as peppers. The flavor took me back to the Bangkok of the late 80s when curry was receiving a culinary renaissance. Every bite danced around my mouth exciting my palate and mixing with the highly addictive broth that dominated this dish. It was authentic and executed with utmost precision and care. I truly enjoyed this \"panang curry with chicken at the thai hot spice level\" as one of the top five curries I have ever had, it excelled in flavor, temperature, spice level, balance, and presentation.\n   That leaves my friend's personalized vegan dish on a pineapple fried rice. I tasted his dish as well. The rice was presented with a meticulous placement of cilantro as garnish on top of the dish. Chunks of hearty pineapple and grilled tofu lined the insides of the dish and created a stunning presentation for the overall experience. The flavor was an eruption of different ingredients all coming together under the parameters of this fried rice. I tasted a smoky presence in the dish that lingered as a finish to the sample I had. Authentic once again with the right ingredients and color to the rice. The balance of the soy sauce used to the ratio of ingredients was excellent as well. The pineapple tasted fresh and not overcooked. A treat for the most discerning of palates. This dish also excelled on all objectives. Portion was of a medium nature however enough when combined with the appetizers to offer a satisfying experience.\n   We were checked on twice more during our meal. Once again by our server and later by the owner who saw us eating slowly and savoring every bite. The service was of the finest quality and the food was even better. Even one of the chefs came out to ensure our dishes met our expectations. I loved every minute of this meal and my visit to Si-am. I thanked the owner personally, did not leave any leftovers, and informed them of two things: 1 they would be reviewed by one of the top editors on trip advisor with the higest of scores and 2 this would be my destination point when in Tampa. The pricing was also equally enticing being moderately priced for superb thai cuisine served with the highest level of service I have received in a long time. Sadly I had to be on my way before missing my bus.

I noticed too that the restaurant was next door to a local theatre.\n\nWe went there on a Sunday night when it was quiet. The staff were great, we got a table and meus and water very quickly. We selected from a good variety of food on the menu and I can recommend the chicken spring rolls as a starter (a welcome individual sized portion - unlike the monster portions in Orlando) and I also had the sweet and sour chicken, which was a delight. A man who may have been the owner regulalry came over to make sure every thing was okay and have a few friendly words, this really made you feel at home.\n\nThe beers and soft drinks were competatively priced and overall the food was good value for money.

He has been several times before.  It was mid-evening and the restaurant was quiet, with only two other tables seated.  The atmosphere is mellow with low lighting and a pleasant d\u00e9cor.   My friend ordered a glass of cabernet sauvignon and I tried the Chateau St. Michel Riesling,  plus we had a round of waters.  For entrees my friend had the pan drunken noodles with shrimp, I had the standard pad Thai with crispy tofu.  We enjoyed our wine and our meals, but especially the friendliness of the staff.  I have certainly had better pad Thai elsewhere, though this one was alright.  I think my friend enjoyed his entr\u00e9e more than I did mine. It was kind of him to treat me to dinner.

It has changed hands 3 times in 5 years.  It has always been good but the new owner and his fiance seem to really want to take this restaurant to a new level. \n\nFirst thing we noticed, even before knowing that there were new owners, was that the decor had changed - for the better.  The colors were richer, with table cloths now in under the glass table tops and a fancy Thai design.  \n\nThey also installed a canoe water feature by the door that was very soothing and set the tone of being in a Thai restaurant in Thailand.  All the chairs were changed out at the tables.  The chairs were much higher quality than what they replaced.  They hit a home run on the redecorating, for sure. \n\nThe new owner made the rounds at every table talking about his plans for his new restaurant.  It was very obvious that he was excited and proud of where he and his fiance wanted to take the restaurant.  In all my years going to this place I had never interacted with the owner as much as we did this night.  He explained that they have big plans (outdoor seating, etc.) but that the menu was going to initially stay the same but they would add specials.  I thought that this was very smart so that they didn't alienate the patrons that were loyal customers. \n\nWe ordered our usual dim sum and spring rolls as our appetizer starters.  They were even better than the last time we had dined there.  The spring rolls were crispy and they now cut them at an angle so they were hot, but bite sized.  This was a great addition.  I also ordered won ton soup and it was the best I had ever had there. \n\nDinner was hot and right on time, served with a smile by an attentive wait staff.  My wife had pepper steak and I had cashew beef.  Both dishes we had enjoyed several times over the years but this time was definitely the best yet.  \n\nOverall, we have always loved this place but now we love it even more. If you live downtown and haven't tried this wonderful Thai place you don't know what you are missing.  If you are visiting I would highly recommend that you stop by and give them a try.  From what we've seen so far the changes are for the better.  \n\nBravo Si-am.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-11T03:53:05-0500", "location_id": "3222195", "id": "248762759", "user": {"username": "jeffzamp", "user_location": {"name": "Tampa, Fl", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Delicious!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34678-d3222195-r227256930-m11068-Si_am-Tampa_Florida.html#review227256930", "text": "Well worth finding.
