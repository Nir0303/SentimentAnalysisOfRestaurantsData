I mean the dance area is shared with the band and the 4 other couples that could fit if they are skinny!\n\nYou are always elbow to elbow with someone or someone is squeezing by to get by.  The entrance is on the porch on Front Street and the other entrance is in the rear in the parking lot.  I think there is more room on the shared porch than there is in the bar.\n\nBathroom key are hung on fly swatters and the facilities are in the public area of longhouse building this bar is in. \n\nThe bartenders are really friendly and helpful.  The selection of wine is limited as is the beer. If you're picky you'll be disappointed.\n\nI've always had a good time here and the quality of bands they get is top notch.  I just wish the damn place was bigger!\n\nNet-Net: One of the better places for entertainment in Temecula and the best on Front Street.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-16T12:27:08-0400", "location_id": "5844642", "id": "229293446", "user": {"username": "Mr_Firestone", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Great Saturday Night Music", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33165-d5844642-r195954101-m11068-Front_Street_Union-Temecula_California.html#review195954101", "text": "Loved the band, the music, and the vibe!
