We stayed in a king room, which was quite small but there were plentiful outlets for charging devices, dark heavy curtains, very speedy free wifi, the bathroom had robes, and most importantly, a shower door rather than a shower curtain.    On this trip, we stayed in Evanston because of a family member was hospitalized there, and for perspective, we are hotel snobs and usually stay at the Four Seasons or the Peninsula when traveling to Chicago.  So with that in mind, this small tucked away little hotel had the BEST service we've ever experienced.  From the moment we walked in, they greeted us by name, and were attentive and accommodating throughout our stay.   The service was very personalized and  every staff person  we encountered throughout this stay went out of their way to offer assistance, anticipate our needs, and offer personalized attention.   Another thing that definitely deserves mention is the hotel \"continental breakfast\", which we normally skip but which in this case was superb.   They have a baker who bakes homemade croissants (incredible) and a variety of other pastries.  there was also  steel cut oatmeal (the real kind), and most notably, small batch Greek yogurt that was hands down the most amazing I've ever tasted (evidently, they import it from Canada?).  The hotel does not have a gym, but both Evanston Athletic Club and LA Fitness are just down the street, and day passes were $25 and $15 respectively.

It looked very nice, a traditional European feel, but clean and updated. Upon arrival I was greeted by a musty smell in the lobby, which was quite old and run down in appearance. I asked to see my room and was taken on an equally old and creaking elevator to a room that was not at all as advertised online. Very small, clean, but antiquated. When I informed the desk clerk that I would not be staying he refused to cancel the reservation (because it was not done 24 hours in advance) and I had to dispute it with my credit card company.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-08T05:47:27-0400", "location_id": "114603", "id": "402790258", "user": {"username": "John P", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Lovely visit ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35972-d114603-r402260072-m11068-Margarita_European_Inn-Evanston_Illinois.html#review402260072", "text": "Very cute boutique hotel which was still quite close to downtown Chicago.

The tea selection could have been higher-end, but I'm a tea-snob. \nThe Margarita is convenient to the \"L\" train into Chicago and to Northwestern University.  It's perfect for a couple, but like many European hotels, our room was small - especially for a family of four. The picture of the Queen-Twin-Twin bed on the website showed bunk beds, but we had trundles, which made for cramped quarters.
