I have eaten here several times and not been disappointed. You will not find shark fin soup nor camphor-smoked duck on the menu. But you will find dishes prepared with care, flavor, and good fresh ingredients that are tasty, well presented, and look attractive on the plate. I have had Beef Chow Fun (medium wide, not traditional 2-inch wide noodles), several lunch specials, and a simple Special Lomein. Service is also very good. Whether you  are dining alone or with friends, you will not be ignored. (I also appreciated little touches like a container of fresh jasmine blooms in the women's room.) There are lunch specials from about 11 AM to 3 PM, starting at about $8.00. A single entree for dinner, starting at about $8.00,  is more than enough for one person.  There is usually adequate parking on the street in front.  The only reason that I do not give this place a \"five\" is because the menu is not the least bit adventurous. But they do the old standards very well, better than anyone else in the Coachella Valley.\nPlease note:  the older central part of Indio, where this restaurant is located, is undergoing construction, landscaping, and signage upgrades.  This restaurant is located on Towne St., between the Indio library and Highway 111, closer to 111.  Many street signs have been removed temporarily.  Towne St. is parallel to Jackson and about three blocks west of it.\nTowne St. begins on the north side of Highway 111 and does not cross it.
