We were well looked after by Doug at the bar and enjoyed our cocktails along with our fried oyster and brussel sprout appetizers - both were flavorful and light. Of special note this visit was the superb guest management efforts by Cailey in greeting and maintaining a positive atmosphere on a very crowded Saturday night.

Tiny bar area. Also some other seating for food, but we sat the bar. Small and intimate. Friendly and helpful bartender. From the winter cocktail menu, had the bacon-infused Ol' Fashioned.
