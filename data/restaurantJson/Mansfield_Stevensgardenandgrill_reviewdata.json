They have a nice variety of food selections it has great atmosphere. They also have live music on the patio on some nights. I see there are some bad reviews about the service but I have dined there more than a dozen times and have never had a problem.

We had the worst service, it took over 20 minutes just to get any server to our table. I had to go to the hostess 2 times to find out if we even had a server. Once we did get a server it took an hour to get our food. We spent $142 for 6 people (2 kids in our party) which I don't mind spending for good service but this was awful. I've never in my life written a review it's too bad this was my first one, I'm very upset over the experience. Needless to say don't waste your time or money on this place. Too bad I couldn't rate is worse that Terrible!!! Stevens Garden you should be ashamed!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-05-30T19:36:17-0400", "location_id": "4079274", "id": "208121927", "user": {"username": "p b", "user_location": {"name": "Mansfield, Texas", "id": "56225"}}}]}
