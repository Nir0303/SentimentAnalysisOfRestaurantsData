It is a bit of a hole in the wall but the food is so yummy.  the lunch special is well worth the cost and if you want something a bit more exotic you can ask to see the \"other\" menu.  typically this is only on the dinner service.  you can get real Asian food that is prepared well and to the taste of the culture not the Americanized version of Asian food.  the proprietor is from Vietnam and can cook well.  The other thing so good about this place is the tea.  it is very strong and sooooo good.  drop in and have the lunch or live adventurously and go for diner and get something you cant name.

This was my first time at Golden Wok, and I had the Hunan Shrimp with hot and sour soup and steamed rice.

Really enjoyed the hot and sour soup, since I have had it at other restaurants and found it tasted too much of vinegar. The Golden Wok served a much better soup than many other places I've eaten.\n\nThe only complaint I would have is that my dish could have used more seasoning, but then I didn't add the sauces the server provide.
