The only good thing about our order was the Sesame Chicken; sweet and crispy like it should be. The fried rice in the combo plates was bland, and it was burnt so it gave off a very bitter taste. The egg rolls tasted like feet, and the sweet and sour sauce tasted old. The vegetable lo mein also had a burnt bitter taste, and the vegetables didn't taste fresh. The fortune cookies were also stale. We aren't picky people or world class foodies, but for $27 you should expect fresh food. Overall, I don't think we will return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-12T17:23:00-0400", "location_id": "933163", "id": "417703778", "user": {"username": "Ashley S", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Our favorite for takeout", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43022-d933163-r339822203-m11068-Golden_Star-Eagan_Minnesota.html#review339822203", "text": "We often call Golden Star when we're at a loss for what to eat for dinner.
