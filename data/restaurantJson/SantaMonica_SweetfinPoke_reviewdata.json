It is totally set up with all togo containers that  are used whether you eat in or not. \n\nToday I enjoyed the spicy tuna bowl creamy togarashi sauce, hijiki, avocado over a bed of rice. It was fantastic with just the right amount of heat, I will order it with less dressing so it doesn't overpower the tuna. I also had the mango albacore, ponzu-lime sauce, macadamia nuts ginger. \nWhen you hear the combinations of these wonderful ingredients it makes your mouth water! This just rocks the tastebuds! \n\nThe restaurants atmosphere is a bit cold and small but the music and lighting are cool. It's a fast and efficient joint that closes at 9:30. Love it and I'll be back soon to poke around some more.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-28T20:26:33-0500", "location_id": "8144457", "id": "329637095", "user": {"username": "Bradley1965", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Monica, California", "id": "33052"}}}]}
