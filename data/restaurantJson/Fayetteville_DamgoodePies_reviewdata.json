I like a very simple pizza - one topping, which is usually roasted garlic.They do it very well!!  My buddies got specialty pizzas, and seemed to enjoy them as much as I did. The crust is tasty and the sauce is spiced nicely without overwhelming the topping.\nThey also have a few craft beers on tap. I tried a couple of them and was pleased with both.\n\nBack to the delay... The manager came and spoke to us. She stated that the waitress may have gotten busy and forgot to turn in the ticket right away. That made for about an hour wait. She was very apologetic, and ended up taking 75% off the pizzas.\n\nAll-in-all a good pizza joint.
