Very modern, clean and convenient location in the heart of downtown Eau Claire. The rooms have an industrial vibe with newspaper-style wallpaper and mini fridge in the room, semi-suite style...would have liked to have microwave as well but unfortunately there is just a fridge. Free in-room and throughout hotel wi-fi. The hotel amenities are nice, there is a Fitness Center in the basement that appears brand-new and pool as well. There are 2 computers down in lobby with a printer but in an open standing-only area so no real business center and no privacy as it is in the middle of lobby and not a separate room. No room service unfortunately but there is a small snack bar attached to the front desk. Easy convenient automatic check-out so you can just leave and receipt is emailed. \n\nValet is convenient and not terribly expensive (believe it was $9/day) and they will leave your car out in front if you have to catch the 5 am flight our of Eau Claire airport.\n\nThe hotel staff is pleasant and helpful but need to be a little bit better trained, as they charged my personal credit card on 2 separate occasions instead of using the pre-paid and pre-booked card that my company booked the hotel under. Also I have to remind them every time that I am a HHonors member, even though it is always on my reservation...they never offer the Honors water and cookie and every time I have to ask for this...small thing but this brings it down a star, as any excellent rating would require that kind of service level. The staff is also not very knowledgable about the area restaurants or attractions and were unable to provide me with recommendations for a nearby run or restaurant when I asked, which I thought was odd in such a small town. There is a restaurant (The Informalist) and coffee shop (ECDC) attached to the hotel, which both very convenient and really good quality, especially the coffee shop....the restaurant menu gets tired after a few nights, as the menu is fairly small and includes a lot of pork and meat dishes so limited if you are vegetarian or  kosher/halal.

In the past Eau Claire lacked hotel options however with the remodel and opening of the Lismore along with other new hotels (Holiday Inn, Hampton Inn & Oxbow) this has changed that and hopefully propels other places into improving and therefore result in competitive rates. The rate was great because I used Hilton Honors Points, still I would consider the Lismore in the future because of the downtown location, clean rooms, on-site coffee house, and The Dive Bar.\n\nThe room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom had great lighting, plush towels, good-smelling toiletries. We didn't hear any noise from the hallway. We chose an odd-numbered room because another review claimed noise was a problem on the even side (from the Dive Bar outdoor area). However I don't think this would be a problem when the weather is cool as no one is outside. Our room faced downtown and the surrounding hills, it was a pretty view.\n\nEC DC (the coffeehouse) looks out on the main street and there are several seating areas; both in the coffeehouse and also what is sort of a hotel lobby - an area with seating by a fireplace, a long table, long leather couches, and lots of individual chairs. I had a mocha and it was one of the better I have ever had, I also bought the macaroons for a hostess gift. On Sunday morning we had the family come back to the hotel for coffee and the space worked well for ages 12-85!\n\nOn Saturday night we visited the Dive Bar on the 2nd floor (the signs were slightly confusing, we didn't realize it was on the 2nd floor until the elevator opened and we saw it.) This is a cool space also with plenty of seating options. They featured some local breweries and I had a 'Farmer's Daughter' a spiced blonde ale from Lucette Brewing out of Menomonie. Generally when I'm in Wisconsin I'll have a Spotted Cow as a safe bet but I don't believe they had it on tap. I might like this one better than the cow! It was easy to talk as the music wasn't blasting and the crowd was pretty low-key.\n\nWe also liked the downtown location; we walked to several stores including my favorite antique store, The Antique Emporium. The store has a wide-range of items including items that most likely came out of some of the grand homes built with logging money. You don't have to dig through a lot of crap and it's in a cool old building.\n\nOne drawback is parking, it is $8 or 9 for in and out valet services which is pretty inexpensive. However we like to have our car 'on-hand' for stuff we keep in the car and because we were coming and going a lot. But it really wasn't an issue as there is plenty of free 2-hour parking on the surrounding streets.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of interaction with staff but where we did interact, folks were polite and efficient.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Pete B, General Manager at The Lismore Hotel Eau Claire - a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, responded to this review", "text": "Wow!\nThank you for a most detailed review on the Lismore Hotel.
