I've always liked the restaurant, but I don't remember ever eating there and thinking, \"This is really great pizza!\" Yesterday I did. Thin crust but with thick, soft, and tasty outer edges, sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Crust that you'll want to eat every bite of. The main part of the pizza was great, too. Good-tasting cheese, toppings and sauce all blended together in the right amounts. We also had the french bread-style cheese bread as an appetizer. It was crispy yet soft, with a good amount of cheese, and served with a cup of pizza sauce for dipping. My wife and I visited with our 5-year-old grandson and he enjoyed it, which is always a plus. Fun and colorful decor. (Interesting suggestion from my grandson: With a large number of TVs visible everywhere, all on sports channels, he wondered why none of them had any kids shows on.) Overall, it was a very enjoyable dinner, and the food was the highlight. Definitely worth a try if you haven't tried it before, and maybe worth another try if you haven't been there lately.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Kim S, Owner at Mellow Mushroom, responded to this review", "text": "Hi!\nThank you so much for the very kind review!
