The staff is nice and welcoming, their taste in music is indie-oriented, and decorations (odd glass vases, low hanging lamps, chalkboard menus, and a variety of seating options) means that this place has a ton of character.\nTheir fresh-squeezed juice is good, but probably not worth the $3.50 it cost me to have some, but their pies are pretty darn good (more like calzones). The pies change flavor every week- this week they are hitting the Pok\u00e9mon-Go theme (Porkachu and Vegemon Go!), and I was not disappointed (especially with their Siracha sauce).\n\nOverall, this was the perfect place to plop down after a long bike-ride, read my book, study up on economics (of course I'm a medical student so that will be relevant), and to catch up with my brother who is currently hanging out in a coffee shop in Seattle.
