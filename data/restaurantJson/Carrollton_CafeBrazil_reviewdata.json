When the bill came, the charge for the burger was $9.99 plus the $1.39 for the sweet potato fries.  I questioned the charge for the burger.  The waitress took the ticket and asked the manager about the increased charge. She came back and said the manager had taken off the $1.39 for the upgraded fries but left the burger charge at $9.99.  I had a problem with that because the difference between the menu price ($8.29) was $1.70 less than the $9.99 I was charged for the burger because I was still shorted 31 cents.  I questioned it but did not make a scene.  The 31 cents is a small amount of money but the bigger issue was that Caf\u00e9 Brazil did not honor the menu price for its food.

It has been \"our\" outpost of this chain and we were thrilled to have it in our community in which we have lived for years. \nThat all has changed in the last year or so. Over the last several visits both the service and the cooking have been inconsistent and lacking at times. Today was the last straw.\nWe were three who arrived less than thirty seconds apart. No one was at the hostess stand and there were a few free tables. I was acknowledged from behind the bar, and asked how many. As soon as I replied, a young lady came forward. We indicated a specific table and were led there without word. She did not even pause enough to receive a \"thank you\" from us and never turned around. Two or three minutes later, two servers tried to deliver food to us. We told them we had not yet ordered. Yet again we were approached with food by another server, and again told them we had not yet ordered. \nWe chatted, then noticed that several tables around us had now left and been cleared, yet no one has come to offer to take even a drink order. It was now 15 minutes from when we had been sat down at a clearly visible table. There were now many empty tables around us. One of our party got up to ask for a server. He stood at the counter and was not acknowledged at first. He asked who was serving us and was again ignored by two servers who simply walked by as if he weren't there. A gentleman appeared. This was the manager on duty Vic. Apparently some list was now consulted to see who was to serve our party, though he was still not acknowledged. On his sitting back down, we waited a minute more or so, then got up and left.\nI am extremely sad that this was the outcome of a visit that was actually planned to celebrate a birthday, it shouldn't be the outcome of any of our visits. I am further disappointed that a lovely place that is in our community will not be receiving support from those who have lived in the community for more than four decades. We will be taking our business to a restaurant that values us as customers from now on.
