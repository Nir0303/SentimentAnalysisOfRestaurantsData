There are now French, Italian, and Moroccan dishes as well as Thai. (Yes, I know France is not \"the Orient.\") My review is mixed. The \"wild mushroom\" appetizer had very tame mushrooms - shitake and portabella, but was tasty in a tomato cream sauce. The main flavoring was ginger and pepper. I think a puff pastry would have been better than the filo sheet the chef chose to use. The duck in tamarind sauce was very good, cooked so there was no fat and the skin was crispy. Presentation was lovely and tamarind was an interesting variety for cherry or orange or apricot. Moroccan chicken didn't seem very Moraccan. The spices were very subtle. The shrimp and scallop dish was nothing special. Thai tapioca is less sweet than what Americans are used to, so it wasn't crazy to put coconut ice cream on it.\nService was very good. My favorite thing about this place is that - unlike so many restaurants today - you can actually hear the people on the other side of the table, and have a real conversation over dinner.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-06-10T21:13:04-0400", "location_id": "4359397", "id": "279416845", "user": {"username": "Roseleaf", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Thai Fusion", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33037-d4359397-r258673546-m11068-Savory_Orient-San_Rafael_Marin_County_California.html#review258673546", "text": "I had lunch there today. I found it online and was curious what fusion meant in San Rafael for Thailand. What I look for is layers of flavor and it needs to be above the norm. From being seated to leaving it took 45 minutes without dessert. Light room, not so busy. I got the lunch combo. Value here as you get soup, salad, and entre. The soup was a choice of two. I selected the lemon grass soup with coconut milk. Always refreshing. Standard in flavor. My server surprised me with a sample of the other ...an artichoke soup. I never had one before and it was very good. The salad was different as the Chef used a red wine vinegar which we don't see often. Also in my salad which I appreciated was a thin slice of red bell pepper for a burst of flavor and jicama. How nice to find the texture in my food. The entre was called Drunken Noodle. I had mine with chicken. The description said it was fettuccini which lead me to believe it was a wheat pasta. It was actually a chow fun or wide thick Chinese Rice Noodle. I prefer Chow Fun as it has a wonderful texture. As I was eating, I was looking for layers of flavor which would identify this as a bistro. Not just a one sauce flavored meal. I am happy to say, they were there. Subtle, but present. I could distinguish the aromatic herbs over the top and underneath. The sauces were light and noticeably lighter in salt. A blessing to many customers. Because this is fusion, don't expect the Thai fire and heat in the meal. Just enjoy the pleasant surroundings and your meal. Thank goodness they didn't over decorate. Enjoy.
