Really highlighted the old small town cafe.\n\nFood was what you would have expected from an old style diner.

I think the gravy is actually the poblano soup. Quite good. It had just a slight bit of kick to it an was not overwhelmingly hot. I ate it like a soup and will probably order it as a soup in the future. The gravy on the chicken fried steak was much thicker but not as interesting.  Typical gravy for chicken fried steak.

A bit heavier than a like, but still very good.\n\nNiether of us had room for dessert and we did have leftovers.  \n\nService is very friendly (once again, typical of a small town diner) and we gabbed with the waitress for quite a bit of time.  \n\nWe will be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-15T14:05:12-0400", "location_id": "2430606", "id": "373182965", "user": {"username": "Neal B", "user_location": {"name": "Rowlett, Texas", "id": "56587"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Tight  boss", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55884-d2430606-r365602857-m11068-Main_Street_Cafe-Garland_Texas.html#review365602857", "text": "making customer tip when they on limit income I well never go back tight  rude owner fellowing outside", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-20T04:36:54-0400", "location_id": "2430606", "id": "365602857", "user": {"username": "Alison C", "user_location": {"name": "Kilgore, Texas, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Real Food Served Here", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55884-d2430606-r358243375-m11068-Main_Street_Cafe-Garland_Texas.html#review358243375", "text": "My wife and I frequent Main Street Caf\u00e9 in Garland.

We were so excited to finally have a quiet restaurant so close to home that had a table cloth and gave us an upscale dinner where we could enjoy each others company and not be bothered by screaming kids or loud patrons at a bar.  We returned over and over.  After a few months we noticed our normal waiter was gone and the last time we went our waiter didn't even know the menu or if they even had a dessert and our drinks were never refilled even once.  So sad. The first time we went I had the salmon and asparagus...so delish. The last time we went I had the chicken and needed a saw to cut it.  My husband mentioned the loud patrons behind him.  He was surprised when I told him it was two ladies who worked there that were talking to patrons.  There food was cold by the time the two ladies let them eat.  Food quality is down.  Service is down.  Atmosphere is down.

I was pleasantly surprised to find one in the Dallas Metroplex in the city Garland where I live. Hungry for a Texas Staple, Chicken Fried Steak, I discovered The Main Street Cafe. Located on main street of down town Garland near the town square. Upon entering I was surprised to find not a little cafe but more like dinner place with table cloth, water glasses, and flatware prepared table. But upon seating by a waiter and look at the menu the surprise turned to joy to find hamburgers, salads, and most important chicken fried steak on the list of items. The prices were a little high $12 for the chicken fried steak with two sides but I was starving. I ordered the steak with mash potatoes cream gravy and black eyed peas. I was very pleased with batter on the steak not to much just right very well seasoned. The potatoes were indeed real not from a box and thick cream gravy. I recommend any looking for the home cooked meal served in a restaurant give the Main Street Cafe in Garland a try.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-10-29T17:07:44-0400", "location_id": "2430606", "id": "323058562", "user": {"username": "Jack-R-3114", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
