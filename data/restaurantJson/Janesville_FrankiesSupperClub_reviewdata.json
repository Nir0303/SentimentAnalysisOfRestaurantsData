We both ordered the fish fry. I ordered the cod and hubby ordered walleye. We were both very pleased. Each meal came with a nice salad with homemade dressing. There was a variety of lettuce, unfortunately, including iceberg. We could do without the iceberg, please. Still, the large salad was nice. Along with the salad, is a bread basket with crackers and a couple pathetic buns. Skip these, though the honey butter was great.  When the fish plate came it also had au gratin potatoes and some veggies (broccoli, carrots and cauliflower) lightly steamed and still a bit crunchy. Perfect. Besides the couple missteps on iceberg lettuce and pathetic buns, Frankie's offers a wonderful meal that is way more than one person can eat. The service was great, the ambience is lovely and the price is good. This place will go back on our regular list.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-02T09:08:41-0500", "location_id": "7337204", "id": "323937788", "user": {"username": "Traveler8a", "user_location": {"name": "Janesville, Wisconsin", "id": "59989"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "fabulous", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59989-d7337204-r323586930-m11068-Frankie_s_Supper_Club-Janesville_Wisconsin.html#review323586930", "text": "my son picked this place for his 27th birthday dinner.

Pricey, too much salt, too many sauces.  If you're looking for healthy, look elsewhere.  Chicken Cordon Bleu had an overpowering sour taste (the aged swiss cheese). Sweet potato souffl\u00e9 would have been better if not spiced to taste like pie (nutmeg?). My dining companion liked the pork loin stuffed with cranberries. Menu is limited; no sandwiches. Nothing on the menu for less than $10, including the appetizers.  Most entrees were $15 - $23.  No kids menu.  \nDoes it drive anyone else crazy to have a server always refer to the guests as WE?  How are WE tonight?  Are WE ready to order?  Do WE need more time? Did WE save room for dessert?  I don't recall that we invited HER to dine with us!  I'm also not fond of places that feel the need to ask if it's your first visit because they need to explain the structure of the menu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-09-18T17:40:45-0400", "location_id": "7337204", "id": "311685568", "user": {"username": "2contenttravelers", "user_location": {"name": "Madison, Wisconsin", "id": "60859"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Great fish fry!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59989-d7337204-r306478174-m11068-Frankie_s_Supper_Club-Janesville_Wisconsin.html#review306478174", "text": "Very clean restaurant!!\n\nGreat food!!\nReasonable prices!\nThey were short staffed the night we were there!!
