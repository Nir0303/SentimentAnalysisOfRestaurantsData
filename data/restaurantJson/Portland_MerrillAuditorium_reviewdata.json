From the symphony, opera, rock, musicals, comedy shows, and more, there's always a huge variety of stuff programmed throughout the year. It's a rather comfortable venue, though tall people should probably avoid the first rows of the balconies. There's a good amount of stair climbing to access the center sections of the second balcony, though it is all served by an elevator.\n\nFor best sound, I would recommend not going too deep into the first balcony (Grand Tier) or anywhere in the back of the ground floor (Terrace) as these spots are covered by the seating above them. Visuals are generally good throughout, though the seats in the balconies have much better vertical spacing compared to the Orchestra/Terrace seats on the ground floor.\n\nIf you're around when the Kotzschmar Organ is open for tours, I highly recommend a trip in. It takes about an hour and a half, starting with a demo of the organ. Following that, docents take small groups inside the organ (yes, you go inside it, it's that big). You will visit the inside of the air chest, which is the primary cavity that gets pressurized to feed the valves of the pipes during its operation. They will explain what you're seeing and how it works. After that they'll take you up behind the facade to see some of its pipes, which are attached to the top of the air chest you were just in. I thought it was fascinating to see and I highly recommend it for any music lover or mechanically curious person.
