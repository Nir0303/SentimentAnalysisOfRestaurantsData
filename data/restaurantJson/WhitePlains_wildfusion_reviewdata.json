As previously noted, this new two-story W.P. fusion is striking in its design, with a modern, hip atmosphere that is pleasing to the eye.\nUnfortunately neither the food nor the service measures up to the atmosphere.  To begin with, the pretty young hostess had no record of the reservation which was definitely called in several days in advance of our meal, and instead of arguing with us about whether we had or had not made a reservation, she could have merely apologized and just seated us in the almost empty restaurant.\nSecond, the waiter brought our main courses out while most of us were still eating our soup so they had to be sent back - not a problem with the sushi dinners but annoying for the people who had ordered hot food.\nThird, the same waiter managed to spill part of everyone's main course on the table as he was handing the plates around.  It was almost comical, and he apologized very nicely, but really, had he ever worked as a waiter anywhere else, we wondered.\nThe sashimi platters were simply beautiful to look at, but the fish was unevenly cut and, oddly, not very flavorful.\nPrices are reasonable, and the place is really attractive.  They just need to get a better handle on customer service, and maybe a new sushi chef.\nI'd go for a drink, but there are many better places for Japanese food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-03T05:46:49-0500", "location_id": "7734568", "id": "324135301", "user": {"username": "Fussbudget07", "user_location": {"name": "Mount Kisco, New York", "id": "48212"}}}]}
