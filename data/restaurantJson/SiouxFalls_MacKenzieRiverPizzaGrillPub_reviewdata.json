The guy finally brings a sample glass of my wife's drink after 45 minutes. Not the full pint she ordered....just a 2oz sample. We then question about our food orders to find out that one order wasn't even prepared and would take even more time to make. It was meatloaf so I'm not sure how a restaurant can't prep that for dinner service. Finally after an hour or so we got our original appetizer 5 minutes before our orders came out...minus the meatloaf. As we all were half finished with our meals the meatloaf order finally came, and a manager brought us an additional appetizer as an apology. As if we wanted to eat another appetizer as we finished our meals that already took forever. Our waiter was at our table at least 6-7 times explaining the delays and never once refilled our drinks. Just as I was about to throw the empty glass and break it to get some attention he finally took our refill request. I set the timer on my phone and 11.5 minutes later we got our waters. Of course taking our empty glasses was too much work so there we sat with several empty plates and glasses for the remainder of our miserable time. I realize there can be some delays when places are busy but this place wasn't full by any means and it was early dinner service.
