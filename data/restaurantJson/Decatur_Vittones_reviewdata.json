We got a large cheese pizza, large buffalo chicken pizza and a chicken Alfredo pasta. It was 49 dollars and some change which is right around what we spend when we go out for a family of 4. So the prices aren't too high. The calzones are very good here, but the pizza is just too good for me to pass up. I'm normally not a think pizza kinda guy. I'm more of a deep dish guy but this pizza is definitely worth the exception.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-04-19T08:02:48-0400", "location_id": "2464291", "id": "266612803", "user": {"username": "Bbrown3664", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Great food at a great price.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30477-d2464291-r265044512-m11068-Vittone_s-Decatur_Alabama.html#review265044512", "text": "Vittone's is one of my go too lunch destinations.
