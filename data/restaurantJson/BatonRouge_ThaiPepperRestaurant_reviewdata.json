The sesame wraps were flavorful, the coconut soup was the best I've ever had, the pad thai was good - my only criticism is I prefer a lime slice on the side and they applied it in back - and the yellow curry was excellent. Service was fast and attentive. Very fresh veggies and seafood, excellent use of spices, overall a lovely experience.
