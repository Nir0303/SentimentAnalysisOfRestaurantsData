The burger was delicious - moist, flavorful and plenty big enough for us to share.\nWe also shared the salad special which was a crispy chipotle-seasoned chicken breast with field greens and assorted other items. The chicken was not prepared to order so it was cold and tough.

We found it by trying places in the Ventura Axxess card.\n\nWith so many chain restaurants out there it's nice to have a Mom and Pop restaurant in Oxnard that serves such terrific food.\n\nWe were there for dinner.  We got a few appetizers (fried green beans & the artichoke) and also the salmon dinner and vegetable stack.  Everything was terrific.  The fried green beans were the best we have ever tasted.  \n\nFresh ingredients and great presentation.  \n\nGood selection of beer.  The prices were very good for everything.  \n\nOur server was wonderful.  Very attentive.  The entire staff was outstanding.  The owner came over and talked to us for a while.  She was super friendly.  \n\nCan't wait to go back and try the burgers.  We saw some being delivered to other diners and they looked fantastic.  \n\nWe will definitely be back!!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-16T12:41:39-0400", "location_id": "4951520", "id": "229296539", "user": {"username": "Christy D", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Tasty food and brews in a decent downtown setting.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32837-d4951520-r219772211-m11068-The_Kitchen-Oxnard_California.html#review219772211", "text": "Dropped in for dinner on blues night and the music was great!
