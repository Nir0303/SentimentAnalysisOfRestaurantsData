Outside they have a few tables and it looks really small, but don't let that fool you, inside the decor and look is so cool. There is a downstairs with lots of couches and places to chill and drink and the upstairs is about the same but I seriously love the decor here. We did indeed get there for happy hour and since I had been drinking so much beer over the last few days, I had a Moscow Mule, which was top notch, the best I have had except for in Prague. They do require a credit card and an ID as a hold for the copper mugs, which if you don't plan to steel them is no problem. They also have a variety of board games you can check out and play. We had the Spanish Torta as a HH app, we weren't sure what to expect but it was like an egg bread with this amazing sauce and cheese on top, really top notch filling food for $6! The music here was also one of my big favs, a mix between 60's strong voiced women and just some really cool jazz.
