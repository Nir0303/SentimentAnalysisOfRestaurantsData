After asking several locals for recommendations for a good burger place (I'm a burger snob and always want to find the good ones), nobody could give me any leads except for chains like In and Out, or Ruth Chris for an upscale burger.  My own research turned up very little but I stumbled on Ruby's Diner.  \n\nAfter finally finding the place, I had the address but there were no signs--at least that I could see--and the restaurant itself was hidden behind a Barnes and Noble, it was a very typical, almost stereotypical diner chain...  white walls, bright red vinyl booths, etc.  I ordered the basic burger and it was served just as you would expect--in a paper-lined, red plastic basket.  The burger was also half wrapped in paper.\n\nI knew when I ordered that it would not be anything special when I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked.  It was a flat burger, flat-grilled, with fresh lettuce and an egg-bread bun.  Quite frankly, the bun was the best part.  There was nothing particularly bad about the burger, but nothing that set it apart from any other.  That's about all I can say; it's exactly the type of burger you'd find at an American Graffiti style diner.\n\nThe fries were the standard frozen then fried type, also expected.  The prices were about average and the service was friendly, but a bit on the slow side.  The one cool thing was that they have a fabulous, big (probably about three feet long) model of a vintage Chris Craft boat revolving in the center of the dining room.\n\nOther than the model boat, I would have been better off going to In and Out Burger or Smashburger.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-01-13T20:07:01-0500", "location_id": "493570", "id": "339828153", "user": {"username": "Valleyblue", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Very nice view of the lake", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32530-d493570-r338050827-m11068-Ruby_s_Diner-Irvine_California.html#review338050827", "text": "Ruby's is a classic.
