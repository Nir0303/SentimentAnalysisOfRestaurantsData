The decor emulates a '50s diner, decorated with lots of auto memorabilia; fun to look at while waiting for your food.  The staff (I always eat at the counter) is cheerful, quick and efficient.  I once had one of their amazing muffins -- blueberry -- heated on the grill and served with butter.  Absolutely delicious, with good coffee to go with it.  The last time I was there it was lunchtime, and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich which was not only hot off the griddle or sandwich toaster, but loaded with cheese and served with pickle slices, the way I like such a sandwich.  And almost the best part -- the prices are surprisingly low for this day and age.
