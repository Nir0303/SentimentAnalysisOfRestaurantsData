It's great when a restaurant offers such a wide range of selections.  It won't break the bank either.  Nice outside dining area.  The only negative about that is there is a park right across the street where the homeless hangout.  Chef came around to the tables too. Great addition to the downtown dining scene.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-08-25T16:51:31-0400", "location_id": "4662607", "id": "174035941", "user": {"username": "wjn3", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2013-08", "title": "Where did you go to high school?", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44881-d4662607-r173635424-m11068-Alumni_St_Louis-Saint_Louis_Missouri.html#review173635424", "text": "Sorry I had to start with an inside joke.  If you ever lived in St. Louis no matter how old you are people will ask where to went to high school.  I went to Alumni as they participated in Downtown Restaurant Week which is great you get to try out new places for a very reasonable price and make a donation (please do) to help feed others.  It's not hard to find if your downtown, I called to make sure where they were and I asked about parking I was told there was metered parking in front and I asked about valet parking and was then told that there is free parking in the garage for up to two hours they validate.  In retrospect the validated parking should have been the first words out of his mouth when I asked about parking.\n\nI was dining with a family member we eat out a lot so I think my reviews are pretty even keeled and fair.  This place makes it connection with St Louis with some of the food they serve their decore and trivia cards on the table.  Loved the decore they did a great job.\n\nOne thing you'll learn about St Louis is we are the birth place of toasted ravioli so make sure you have some while you are here.  During this week for $25 you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert from a fixed menu.  Lots of choices so we started with the toasted ravioli and crab rangoon appetizers.  The ravioli was ok not great just ok.  Frankly I have had better.  I'm a purest I like my ravioli square, these were shaped like a meat pie or half moon.  In my opinion the dough was too thick and the meat was not well spiced I thought they were rather bland.  Now the crab rangoon was like a deconstructed crab rangoon.  It was served in a bowl topped with two avacado slices and half of a grape tomato.It was served with a pile of pita chips I say pita because they were thicker than wonton chips.  I did not care for it.  To me crab rangoon should taste like crab.  This did not.  The color was off it was a brownish color.  The crab rangoon I've eaten is white and fluffy.  I was disappointed in this.\n\nNow the entrees which were the saving grace.  I had the roasted chicken with mushroom polenta and brussel sprouts.  It was very good.  The chicken was moist, the polenta was delicious and the sprouts were very good not bitter.  My sister had something that was like a shishkabob with beef and other meats mixed in it came with pasta and broccolini.  She enjoyed her dinner also.  The desserts were good I had the chocolate cake (more like fudge) and my sis the 7up tart.  I thought both dishes should have been cold, they were room temprature.  The chocolate cake I can buy that on but the tart should have been chilled.\n\nThe waiter was very efficient he moved with lightening speed but I felt he could have been a little more personable and friendly.  Now the gripe I have is that I had leftovers of my polenta and chicken and my sister had her veggies and a small piece of meat left over.  I asked the waiter to pack all of it up in a box.  Well when I looked at it the next day he only packed the meat.  None of the veggies or my polenta of which I had about half left.  I was disappointed, I really liked the polenta!\n\nSo there you go I'd go back but I'd order different appetizers and probably skip the dessert.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-08-23T05:21:31-0400", "location_id": "4662607", "id": "173635424", "user": {"username": "martisparti", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-08", "title": "Hip Decor, Interesting Menu, Attentive Service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44881-d4662607-r171345846-m11068-Alumni_St_Louis-Saint_Louis_Missouri.html#review171345846", "text": "We recently ate lunch two days in a row at Alumni St Louis. First impression of this new downtown restaurant was how cool a look it had. Very comfortable and fun. On both occasions we were seated promptly and drink orders taken right away. I had fish tacos one day, pulled pork the next. Both were excellent. The fish tacos differed from the normal tilapia and instead featured maple glazed salmon. The flour tacos(corn are an option) and filling of a corn and slaw type salad were also delicious. I had zucchini fries which were also good and made me feel virtuous.\n\nThe pulled pork was also delicious, served with cheese and cole slaw on a bun. I had regular fries as a side. The pork was actually pulled and smooth and free of those chunky burnt bits you usually find in this kind of sandwich.\n\nOn both days my companions were pleased with their food also.\n\nService was pleasant and attentive without being obtrusive. Separate checks were not a problem. Right now, before the law students descend, there are plenty of meters available nearby.\n\nOne downside: restrooms are quite a hike, out of the restaurant across a building lobby.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-08-08T08:43:18-0400", "location_id": "4662607", "id": "171345846", "user": {"username": "Kathie D", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}]}
