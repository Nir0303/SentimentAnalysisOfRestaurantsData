When we tried to confirm with the (hopefully new) employee that the sorbet was dairy free, she looked at as oddly and told us that it were primarily made with milk.  When we asked if she was sure, she walked us over to the case, looked at the guide, and said, \"yep, it has dairy.\"  We looked at the guide and saw that it specifically said \"dairy-free.\"  Once we got that cleared up, we got the Blood Orange Sorbetto, and it was fantastic!  So delicious!\n\nWe also got a few chocolates, and were surprised when they rang up a $3 a pop. We were also surprised at how disappointing they were. My husband couldn't taste the Baileys in the Baileys Cream Fudge; my Devils Food Truffle was underwhelming and surprising crunchy for something made with cake crumbs, and the Dark Chocolate Orange's filling was off-puttingly grainy.  Between the price and their appearance (they were beautiful) we expected much more, but at the end of the day, they need to taste good; these missed the mark. \n\nWe won't return for the chocolates or the service, but we might return for the sorbet.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-01T13:09:57-0400", "location_id": "4917883", "id": "424195221", "user": {"username": "NougatNotCaramel", "user_location": {"name": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "id": "28970"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Nice treat after an historic downtown meal", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55543-d4917883-r408986046-m11068-The_Chocolate_Gallery-Bryan_Texas.html#review408986046", "text": "We really enjoy the restaurants in historic downtown Bryan.
