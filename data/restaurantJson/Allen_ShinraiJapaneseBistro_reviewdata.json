Ordered the teriyaki chicken with white meat and fried rice.  Did not receive the white chicken or fried rice.  They remade the meal and once again did not get white meat.  The rice was very greasy and had no vegetables.  I did not want to ask for a new order again.  I used a lot of soy sauce to add flavor the meal.  We will not be back.\n\nThe restaurant was clean.  \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-06T01:35:20-0500", "location_id": "10676753", "id": "435004312", "user": {"username": "TexasFamiy1", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
