It was one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a hotel of  Choice Hotels family. It took over 30 minutes to check into the hotel due to only one person working the desk. We were given key cards to our first room(on the second floor), and the keys would not open the door. The person working the desk had to come up to the second floor and attempt to open the door with a master key card. The master key card would not open the door, so we were assigned a different room, on the fifth floor. The key cards would not open this door either. The person working the desk had to come up to the fifth floor to open the door with the master key card. After three attempts with the master key card, the door was opened. We finally get into a room. The room is warm on a hot day. The AC unit in the front room is unplugged with burn marks on the plug and the outlet. I plugged the unit into the outlet and it worked, but after 15-20 minutes it smelled hot and did not put out any cold air. I  unplugged the unit. The bedroom AC unit worked perfectly.  There were no other available rooms for us to move into, so we stayed in this room. We tested the keys before leaving to go out to eat dinner, and they did not work. So when we returned from dinner we had to have the desk person go up to the fifth floor and let us into our room...again. The faucet in the bathroom had a blocked aerator, so I fixed that issue myself. The room has a large whirlpool tub in the middle of the front room, which is great for a honeymooning couple, but not for two parents and their sons. Gladly there was a small, and I mean tiny small, shower in the bathroom.  The area around the whirlpool tub has metal transition strip to separate the tile floor from the carpet floor. The screws holding down the transition strip have heads raised too high and one of my sons caught his foot on it. The hallway of our floor was hot and muggy. The desk person was always helpful and never complained to us about the conditions of this hotel, but he had to help two other customers get into their rooms as well as reassigning them rooms because their key cards would not work either. The continental breakfast was modest in food selection, but tasted good. The clincher to our whole experience was not just inability to get into our room, but the city was having a parade at the time this whole check-in and room swapping fiasco was transpiring. No signage anywhere about a parade, let alone about our hotel being on the parade route. So, once we were into our room, we could not leave to go meet friends for dinner. We were trapped in because all of the entrances/exits to the parking lot were barricaded by either people lining the streets or police barricades. Additionally, the hotel has two elevators, only one worked but sounded as it were on its last leg. The building appears nice from the exterior, but inside is evidence of lack of maintenance. We stay in hotels of the Choice Hotel family because of great past experiences and a family member who works for Choice Hotels, so we receive discounts on rooms. We do not recommend this hotel, unless some serious repairs are made.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-12T07:26:30-0400", "location_id": "88452", "id": "381880413", "user": {"username": "travisb213", "user_location": {"name": "Minden, Iowa", "id": "38179"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Not bad", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38500-d88452-r381301287-m11068-Quality_Inn_Suites-Waterloo_Iowa.html#review381301287", "text": "Rooms were a bit out dated but they were very spacious, and most of all clean.

I was very skeptical about staying after reading reviews on this site and others but gave it a go anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  We had one of the suites on the top floor and was very happy with it.  The place does need some minor repairs and some updating for sure but it was well worth the money. Our room was huge!  Had a living area with refrigerator and microwave and extra sink and counter. Then a bedroom with a Jacuzzi tub.  The front desk people were friendly and helpful. It was a sell out at the hotel with our state dart tournament in town and they kept up and did a great job. The breakfast in the morning was good also.  Was surprised to see hot foods offered as well as the cereal and yogurt. Overall the place was nothing like the reviews I have read.  My only suggestion would be to maybe do a little updating and this would make it even a better place to stay.  I notice people leave reviews more often when something is bad but not as often on some place that is just fine so I wanted to leave a good review letting people know that we had a great stay and had no major problems.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-15T10:24:06-0500", "location_id": "88452", "id": "347977909", "user": {"username": "Lori K", "user_location": {"name": "Waterloo, Iowa", "id": "38500"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "personal stay", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38500-d88452-r346546601-m11068-Quality_Inn_Suites-Waterloo_Iowa.html#review346546601", "text": "The staff was very accommodative & responded quickly to any requests.
