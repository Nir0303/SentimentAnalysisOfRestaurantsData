The advantage to the buffet is that there is a wider variety of vegetable and salad and there is a dessert.  The disadvantage is that the chicken gets dried out and the vegetables are not seasoned at all.  It's not worth it.  The price is not significantly less than a cafe. Take out is much better.  The counter staff are always friendly and get the right food to the customer.  I have to be in a rush to get food to stop here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-04-22T08:09:03-0400", "location_id": "4514391", "id": "267348839", "user": {"username": "Susan L", "user_location": {"name": "Rowlett, Texas", "id": "56587"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-12", "title": "Grandchildren and I are 'regulars'", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56587-d4514391-r193105073-m11068-KFC-Rowlett_Texas.html#review193105073", "text": "This KFC is very friendly and tries very hard to please customers.
