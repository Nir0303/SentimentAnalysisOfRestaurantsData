The Clovis location has done nothing but disappoint. They either get the order wrong, forget the bread, or both. Here's what happened this time:\nPROs:\n-they put the order together quickly\n-friendly greeting\n\nCONs:\n- it smelled like smoke inside the restaurant. As I was leaving, I saw several young employees hanging around a side entrance, smoking.\n- I ordered a large soup and salad to go. On the phone, I was told that it came with their homemade bread. After I picked it up, I checked the bag before driving away-no bread. \n-When I went back, they put a few extra slices of bread in the bag, and the bread tasted fresh, but it had a funky smell...like...mold..? Unwashed pans...?.I'm not sure, but it wasn't good. \n-I also noticed the soup was small. When I went back, I asked if I'd received the large soup I ordered, and was told that it was a bowl of soup, the largest size they have. Hmm. The one in Sanger is almost twice that size. Same price. \n-The soup is also different. It's still minestrone, but it does not have potato, celery, or carrot pieces like other locations. It has kidney beans, some other kind of bean, and parsley  instead. It also has considerably more black pepper. It isn't necessarily bad, just different. \n-I received the Cesar side salad I'd ordered, but no Cesar dressing, which I'd requested on the phone. \n-I paid $2 tip for the packaging. I guess I should've looked first to see exactly what I was getting before tipping them. \n-Also, when I went back for the bread, my signed credit card receipt was still sitting on the counter in plain view. \n\nIn sum, I won't return to this site. I believe the other Dicicco's locations are very good. This Clovis location seems to be staffed by a bunch of unmonitored teens who care more about lighting up on their smoke breaks than doing their jobs.

There are many DiCicco's across the Fresno area, and they're consistent in their menu, prices, and service. \nThe menu has many pastas with different add-in options and white or red sauce. The customer can substitute red sauce for white or vice versa for most dishes. I like the calzones. They are large and like a pizza (some customers prefer just getting a pizza). The calzones are served drowned in red sauce, so if u don't want that much sauce, just ask for it on the side or without. \nI like the salads. The side salad is fairly large and has pieces of ham or salami, cheese chunks, and cucumber, and sometimes a few black olives are on the salad. \nI often order the soup and salad for my meal. The house soup is vegetable minestrone with large chunks of carrot, zucchini, potato, celery in a flavorful broth. They also have clam chowder, I believe, but I've never ordered it. \n\nThe bread is everyone's favorite. Fresh-baked loaves...not sure what kind...probably Italian loaf. ..served at your table when you order. I only order the soup and salad because I stuff my face greedily with half a loaf of bread. \nI also like the chicken Caesar salad. Large, with about 8 grilled chicken strips, I think it costs around $7 or $8. \n\nI order to go from a DiCicco's near my work fairly often and pick it up on my way home. \n\nIn sum, it's not a fancy-shmancy gourmet restaurant (like Campagnia's or FIVE in northern Fresno [Champlain and Perrin area], or like Macaroni Grill in Riverpark - those restaurants have beautiful decor, and gourmet pasta with gourmet prices. They are all very good.), but it is good food in a casual Italian decorated atmosphere that you can enjoy with family or friends. \n\nHope that helps! \nBon appetit!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-01T12:59:10-0400", "location_id": "540481", "id": "232116311", "user": {"username": "Queen J", "user_location": {"name": "Fresno", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "great selections of great food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32225-d540481-r226423106-m11068-Di_Cicco_s-Clovis_California.html#review226423106", "text": "We have  been here many times and enjoyed it each & every\nTime.
