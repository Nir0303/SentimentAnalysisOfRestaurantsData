They use fresh hand made ingredients, like fresh ground brisket, house cured and smoked bacon, house made pulled pork, and their own fresh made pickles, not to mention their hand cut truffle fries are the reasons their food achieves its great taste and quality. I had the chance to talk to the owners while my food was being prepared and Chris and Terry both have a true passion for what they do and it shows! I found out they even can and ship their pickles, so I bought a few quarts to take home, they were that good!
