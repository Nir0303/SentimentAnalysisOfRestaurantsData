My kids enjoy the unlimited laser tag on Wednesday night. I enjoy bowling and reminding myself how truly an awful bowler I am.  There are sometimes special group rates & coupons available. There is a bar, function room and you can have your food brought to you or you can buy it at the grill. If the kids aren't into laser tag or bowling there is a video arcade with machines that spew tickets for prizes.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-03-23T15:10:44-0400", "location_id": "5571639", "id": "357963507", "user": {"username": "Ferrytrip", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": null}}}]}
