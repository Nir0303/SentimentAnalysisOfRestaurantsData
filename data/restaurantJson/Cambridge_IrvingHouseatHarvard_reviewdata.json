The room I selected did not have a private bathroom; but there were 2 shared bathrooms on each floor - 1 full bathroom with bathtub and shower and 1 with sink and toilet. Not too bad as whenever I wanted to use the bathroom it was usually available. My single room was very tiny with the single bed taking up almost half the room. A desk and night table was also in the room with a small TV on the wall with the standard cable channels. The bed did not have a head board so it made it uncomfortable to watch TV or read in bed. A closet was also available which was very roomy. Everything was clean - the room and bathrooms included. The bed was comfortable and was made up daily. The excellent AC kept the room at a comfortable temp. The desk personnel were friendly and accommodating with 24 hour service and a computer terminal is available off the lobby. I was impressed with the buffet breakfast which is included with the hotel fees - with 4 kinds of coffee to choose from, scrambled eggs, quiche tarts, muffins, cereals, and fruit. There are comfortable seating areas both inside and outside if you wish to talk or read. The hotel is both quirky and funky with paintings for sale in the down stairs eating area. A fridge and microwave is available downstairs.

Parking is available beside and behind the inn; but don't know if they charged for parking as I didn't have a car. The inn is not inexpensive as I paid about $144 which includes taxes for a tiny room with shared bathrooms; but I believe it is in the budget range for Boston accommodations which are very expensive.

I thought to myself, \"Well, it's only for one night...\"  However, I can now say I am confident that Irving House is an excellent value for the dollar.   This is particularly the case given that Boston-area lodging is exorbitantly expensive.\n\n     While I would not recommend Irving House for those travelers more accustomed to 4 and 5-star accommodations at full service boutique or chain hotels, it's more than adequate for those more used to \"European-style\" lodging - comfortable, functional and serves the purpose of simply having a place to hang your hat temporarily.\n\n     I believe there is a mixture of options at IH - I, fortunately, booked a room with a private bathroom, but I noticed a communal bathroom on my floor as well, so I assume there are more affordable options if you wish to share a water closet and shower with your fellow lodgers.    \n\n   My room (on the second floor) was spotless - particularly the bathroom - and had both a mixture of old world Boston charm (the hotel is in a former large home or boarding house) and renovations - including recent lighting fixtures, a comfortable bed and mattress and a flat screen tv with cable.   My room had a charming octagonal window above the bed that let in a fair amount of sunlight as well as a side window and high ceilings.  Additionally the bed was comfortable and I slept very well - the mattress was quite firm however (which I prefer).\n\n    Some people have complained about staff being rude - I did not find this to be the case whatsoever.  While admittedly, I had minimal contact with hotel employees, my check in went smoothly and the staff were professional and courteous.   It is true that there are no elevators available - it is indeed an older, larger home on a quiet, tree-lined, residential side street - so those who have difficulty with or don't like climbing a few flights of stairs might want to seek a room on a lower level or opt for alternative lodging.\n\n    The breakfast was expanded continental fair - I usually skip continental breakfast, but didn't in this case...There were delicious home made, artisan pastries - ham and cheese filled croissants, broccoli, egg and cheese tartlets, fresh veggies (cherry tomatoes and baby carrots), fresh cut fruit, decent coffee, scrambled eggs and all varieties of toasted breads.    Very satisfying meal.\n\n     At under $150, I would consider my stay at Irving House at Harvard well worth the money.   The charm, comfort, proximity to Cambridge (totally walkable) and delicious breakfast all contributing to a decent stay.   While I might not necessarily rush back when I return to Boston, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again if my travel schedule involved the Boston area and my budget required a quick night or two stay at an affordable price.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Rachael S, Owner at Irving House at Harvard, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for staying with us in spite of hearing the voices of unhappy travelers! \nWe are very pleased you enjoyed your stay.
