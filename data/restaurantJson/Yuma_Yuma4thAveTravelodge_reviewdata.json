The bathroom was very small but the room was average.  There was a huge closet with a safe in it, but we only stayed one night so it was just fine, especially for the price.  It is only about a 10-15 minute drive to the border crossing at Los Algodones, which is the reason we were there.  There is plenty of shopping within a couple of miles, and a DQ across the street.  We weren't interested in swimming, which was good because the water was understandably cold.  The 'continental' breakfast options were packaged muffins, dry cereal, and hot beverages.  Again, good enough for the price.  Also, it was nice to have a mini-fridge in the room, and there was a coffee maker though we don't drink coffee so I can't comment on its taste or quality.
