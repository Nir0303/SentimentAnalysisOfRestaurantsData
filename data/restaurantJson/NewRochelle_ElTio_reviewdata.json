Plus, they don't offer free refills of soda or iced tea (they charge $2.50 each). But what I found to be an abomination was when we got the check.  We were only a party of three -- for lunch -- and the restaurant had already added an 18% gratuity to the total.  The menu said that they automatically add a gratuity when there are EIGHT people (which is customary and expected)... but we were THREE.  Our bill came to $51 + some change, and when we asked the waiter about the already-added tip, he said that they recently decided to automatically add the 18% gratuity to any bill totaling over $50.00 \"because a lot of times, we don't get tips.\"  There was no notification of this new policy anywhere...not on the door, the menu, the wall, nothing.  So if someone isn't paying careful attention to the bill, you could easily end up tipping them twice, like we almost did.  He would have had a $21 tip on a $50 check if we had not spotted it. [Ironically, he actually would have gotten more of a tip (20%) if he had left it to our discretion, so he cheated himself of $3.]  I find this practice to be pretty sneaky and underhanded given that they don't notify you clearly.  Couple that with just mediocre food, I have been completely turned off from returning.   There is a Marriott Hotel right across the street.

And cold, my food was steak and shrimp dish it was also cold. we waited like 50 min for the food and when they bring it it looks like it's been sitting there for 15-20 min, not to mention we waited like 20 to be sited and once on the table we were ignored for like another 20 min. When I decided to ask someone who is the waitress here? They looked at me and said let me find out, he asked someone then this other asked somebody else, no body seemed to know, we sat on the table that had not waitress assigned,  so long story short, you are always going to get slow and bad service, the food it's bad if you order steak be prepared to have it burn and dry unless you order really rare I will assumed they will bring it well done, if you want to get so desperate that you almost loose your appetite and ruin your Saturday night with your family, this is the place to go, be prepared to be forced to tip the mediocre waitress they add the tip to the bill\nSorry tio your loyal customers for 20 years are gone, you really kick us out", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-05-24T21:13:46-0400", "location_id": "1066390", "id": "206913776", "user": {"username": "havingfunwithkids", "user_location": {"name": "New YOrk", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "I didn't even get my water!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48246-d1066390-r195027056-m11068-El_Tio-New_Rochelle_New_York.html#review195027056", "text": "If you had to ask to be helped and serviced then it's not a good restaurant.

My girlfriend went to a waitress to see if we could be served and the lady didn't seem happy and kept her head down like she was ashamed. A waiter finally came about but didn't seem enthusiastic about it. We just wanted ordered drinks and appetizers. So we got our drinks and one of our appetizers which was chips and guacamole.  There were no napkins nor utensils on the table. We couldn't wipe our hands or anything. We finished the chips and waited for our waiter again to ask for water and napkins. There were two tables next to us he was also waiting, and he came by to collect their plates. He went to both of their tables and neglected our finished plate. We were quite agitated by this time. So when he came back around to check his other patrons I had to stretch my voice to get his attention. I asked for the napkins and two waters. My girlfriend made a joke saying it'll take another five minutes to ten minutes for those items. AND SHE WAS RIGHT! We received our napkins but no water. We were done waiting for to be served properly and for our food.  It was appetizers! How long does appetizers take? I noticed that a group that had just sat down minutes received their appetizers instantly. So we decided to forget the appetizers and just ask for the check and leave. So we asked for the check, and the waiter has the nerve to say that the food is coming. It's been 30 minutes, it's not coming out!! There was no manager to talk to, no one to come over to apologizes to us. No nothing. The place needs to practice better customer service.
