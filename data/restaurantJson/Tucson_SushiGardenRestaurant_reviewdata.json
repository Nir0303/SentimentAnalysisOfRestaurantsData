Yes, your sushi is indeed very tasty. However, just because you serve delicious food does not mean that your staff can act like a bunch of jerks. On Saturday, September 10th at around 5:30 pm I went to Sushi Garden (Speedway and Alvernon location) for dinner. The customer service was nothing short of horrifying. The one exception would be the hostess, but even she looked like she hated her life.\n\nWe were seated in the middle of the first section of tables, surrounded on all sides by other tables. It was pretty busy at the time, so all of the tables around us were full. For this reason the waiters thought it would be a great idea to use our table as a resting place for items that they were carrying to and from the kitchen. Thus my husband and I had the pleasure of eating our dinner next to other peoples dirty plates, empty serving trays and other random assortments of crap that should have been nowhere near our table. Disrespectful, unsanitary and completely insulting. I would like to point out this occurred seven times throughout our meal (yes, I was counting).\n\nBesides the garbage dump table I was sitting at, the waiter appeared to have no interest in us being there at all. When we asked for another order of sushi she seemed irritated by the request. Oh I'm sorry, should I not be ordering food here? Come on guys, do you want to be a successful business or not? Last time I checked the reason why people go to restaurants is because they feel the hard earned money they have worked so hard for is worth spending. NEWSFLASH, if you treat your customers like cattle they will not come back no matter how good the food is.\n\nNo joke the customer service at Sushi Garden was appalling. However, I will say it is the best sushi I have had so far in Tucson. My husband and I did the all you can eat sushi for $21.95 a person, which includes not only sushi but appetizers as well. For appetizers we ordered the crab puffs and the beef dumplings. The crab puffs were perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy, rich and cream cheesy on the inside. What was impressive about them was that they actually tasted more like crab than they did like cream cheese. Most of the crab puffs I have had in this town taste like there is no crab in them at all. For the sushi we ordered the Las Vegas Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Tuna Sashimi and Eel Sashimi.\n\nBy FAR, Sushi Garden has the best Las Vegas Rolls. Why? The frying is light and airy, crisp and clean. It tastes fresh; unlike all other sushi restaurants that taste like they fried their sushi a month ago. They add the perfect amount of eel sauce, not too much and not too little. The Spicy Tuna was also very tasty. This was actually the first time I have ever tried Sashimi, and I realize now that I am not a huge fan...WAY too much raw at one time. The second I took a bit I was reminded of how easily I could get E.coli. The Eel Sashimi on the other hand was cooked and delicious. It was creamy and sweet, with a buttery chicken-like texture and mild crab-like sweetness. Did you know if a chicken and a crab have sex they produce a baby eel? You learn something new everyday.\n\nThe interior of Sushi Garden is beautiful, each room is decorated with different shapes and colors. However it tends to get extremely loud almost all the time, which drastically affects the atmosphere of the place. Despite the unspeakable service at Sushi Garden, the food is quite tasty. Just make sure to pop some Ibuprofen before heading over.

Line out the door, so we were expecting the food to be good. Sat at the sushi bar and looked at menu. Menu had a number of items marked out. A large number of the rolls include fillers like cream cheese, cucumber, avacado, etc. I have never had a 'Spice Tuna Roll' that had anything other than spicy tuna in it. They put cucumber, cream cheese and avacado, with a minute amount of tuna, yet the roll is rolled huge because of the abundance of rice. We ordered just a tuna roll, and the quality of the tuna was so poor, the tuna itself was pale pink, almost translucent. You could tell this was the quality of fish that they buy for $2/lb on wicked tuna. The Vegas roll was so inedible, we pushed the roll away and didn't eat over half of it. Normally I don't write derogatory reviews, and you can see my last to validate, but I am hopeful that if this is read someone will think about this before spending good money on an inferior product. \n\nHaving moved here recently, we were hoping to find a good sushi place, but we were sadly disappointed. Wished we had gone to the pizza place next door. I guess what we gained in southwestern cuisine in Tucson, we definitely lost in sushi. Does sound funny looking for a good sushi place in the middle of the desert...", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-27T16:59:10-0500", "location_id": "4257136", "id": "351438956", "user": {"username": "xigxag", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta, GA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Loved It!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60950-d4257136-r340719249-m11068-Sushi_Garden_Restaurant-Tucson_Arizona.html#review340719249", "text": "My wife, new UA graduate daughter, & I had dinner here and loved it!
