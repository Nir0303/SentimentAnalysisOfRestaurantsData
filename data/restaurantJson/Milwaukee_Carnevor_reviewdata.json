Escorted to bar next door & not their own bar(glad not January). Seated at 7:45 (outside to return). Order two glass wine two app two Filet & two side. Wine took 15 min to get apps 10 min later (start math). Drank my wine, wife sipped hers. Water filled twice. Waiter picked up plates for apps (remember no wine). 15 min waiter returns with knife & fork for steaks (wine still empty), as he walked away he glances & finally noticed. Got more, took glass & you guessed it, another 15 min. We hear waiters apologizing to others for a 30 group dominating the kitchen.

Meanwhile a 6 top finished & employees broke down the table & pushed a 2 top right against another couple in the middle of their meal. Finally got our food at about 9:20. Ate but no dessert. Waiter knew we were upset & waived the drinks. Manager apologized & knew this was not the Special Occasion we had planned. Finally the owner came over & my wife detailed our worst dinner experience ever. Told owner a reserved large group should not cripple your kitchen. If you want a high priced Logan's Steakhouse this is your place. 2+ hrs. in a loud, crowded, bar cheering the baseball game is not \"Special\". Owner should try Prime or Fleur in Vegas, Burns in Tampa, or Bohanan's in San Antonio to experience fine dining. As I left I informed Mgr there should not be a charge to my card.

I fully pay my own freight when it comes to dining.\n\nMy wife and I had tickets to see \"Man of La Mancha\" at the Milwaukee Repertory Theatre complex on Oct. 23, 2016.  Decided to go to dinner before the show and many of downtown Milwaukee's finest restaurants are closed on Sundays.  We elected to go to a SURG group restaurant, \"Carnevor\", located between Wisconsin Avenue and Mason Street.  The restaurant is in a block with a number of other SURG properties and can be a bit tricky to find.  It on on the east side of the street, next to \"Distil\".  \n\nThe restaurant is a long, narrow building that is richly appointed in very dark wood.  There was what looked like long wooden sticks/stakes providing a wall from the glass hall into the building.  Walls were in dark wood with small lights in the high ceilings and wall sconces.  Tables were dark wood and seats were cushioned and dark.  The only problem with the environment is the chair legs did not slide across the carpeting in the dining room we were seated in.  The restaurant looked like it could easily hold 100 patrons or more, in addition to a bar area located behind the host station.  Can't say I've been in as clean a rest room as the men's room was in any restaurant.  \n\nOur server was Shane (?) and my wife ordered a petite filet that came with some mini-double baked potatoes and steamed vegetables.  I ordered a special, an 8 ounce filet with 3 scallops.  I also ordered a \"BLT wedge, which was to be a wedge of Iceberg lettuce, with blue cheese dressing, bacon, and a tomato.  I only wanted the lettuce, bacon, and ranch dressing.  Note to the salad lover:  Rather than being given a full wedge of lettuce, the wedge was cut up and served on a rectangular platter. The bacon was Nueske's and perfectly crisp.  The ranch dressing seemed to be homemade and quite good.  With my meal, I ordered Saffron Risotto, which had bits of cabbage and radish in it.  The risotto was described as a dish that was plentiful enough it could be shared by two people.  WRONG !!  I tend to eat like I AM two people, and it wasn't enough for me.  However, I cannot even describe to you how good the risotto was - even though it was a wee bit soupy for my taste.  My steak was ordered medium and the center was absolutely red.  I'd estimate the steak was medium rare.  Ordinarily, I'd have sent it back, but the beef was so perfectly aged that the serving of it medium rare was just fine.  The scallops were also a bit undercooked.  Rather than a perfectly white center, they were a bit pearlescent.  But, both scallops and steaks were very good.  Service was excellent without being intrusive.  \n\nCost of our dinner, with one Stella Artois and 2 vodka gimlets came to a total of $160, which is a bit pricey.  My experience has been that one always gets what they pay for when dining at a SURG restaurant.  \n\nPROS:  intimate dining setting; unique decor; clean restrooms; prompt service; good food.\n\nCONS:  parking around the restaurant can be a bit dicey; music over the speakers in the restaurant was \"classic rock\" mix type of music.  Somehow, I don't find Jimi Hendrix's \"If 6 was 9\", off the \"Axis: Bold as Love\" (December 1967, on Reprise Records) as the type of music I'd like to hear while dining in a rather fancy place.  Not that I'm a prude either (I saw Jimi play live in Madison in 1968), but the play list was a bit odd; and food costs are pricey.\n\nNonetheless, my wife and I keep coming back.  Very hard to get an average or bad meal at SURG !!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-24T12:38:16-0400", "location_id": "643280", "id": "431309249", "user": {"username": "Stu T", "user_location": {"name": "Delafield, Wisconsin", "id": "59822"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Dinner with friends", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60097-d643280-r431210688-m11068-Carnevor-Milwaukee_Wisconsin.html#review431210688", "text": "Service and food were phenomenal...Steak was extremely tender, lobster bisque was to die for....would highly recommend this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-24T07:18:00-0400", "location_id": "643280", "id": "431210688", "user": {"username": "Pam19571975", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin", "id": "59889"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Great Steaks", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60097-d643280-r428977114-m11068-Carnevor-Milwaukee_Wisconsin.html#review428977114", "text": "Probably the best steak house in town - and a nicely designed updated one at that.
