Walking up to our table, I requested if it was possible to be seated on the second level.  The young lady seemed very disturbed by my request and said OK but not after rolling her eyes and sighing very deeply.  Our waiter was about as friendly as she was and at one point was very insulting.  This insult was a result of me asking for a new pepper shaker because the one on the table had about three pepper seeds in it and it was difficult to get any seasoning out of it.  He took the shaker, proceeded to grind the seeds ON THE TABLE as if to say, no there is plenty left.  He then asked if I wanted him to season my salad; I declined and shortly after that brought me a new pepper shaker.  Also, considering the beauty of the restaurant and the quality of this franchise, I also was taken back by the fact that he did not offer cold beer glasses for our beer and after bringing some upon request, watched us pour our own into the glass and never once offered to pour it for us.  It may seem trivial but at finer restaurants this is done for their customers.  We did rise above this and leave an 18% tip but would have left a larger one had the waiter been more attentive.
