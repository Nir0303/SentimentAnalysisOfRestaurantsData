As soon as I turned over the first fork full I knew we had a problem. I don't know where all of the liquid came from but it should have been called Taco Soup instead of salad. So disappointing. The flavors were pretty good but I finally poked holes in the taco shell bowl to let out some of the liquid because it was impossible to eat with a fork!!

When we first walked in the doors in front were locked so people were looking at us from inside then came out to open the door for us. They did not know why doors were locked. They let us in and this preppy looking guy advised his server to give us this very TINY booth. Next to main counter and next to main door. \n\nMy partners booth was wobbly and not stable. The booths next to main entrance/next to their counter are very small & can't even get in to seat. I asked server to give us different booth but that preppy manager advised her to give us booth behind our old one. I was frustrated very much and couldn't even get inside to seat, so I pulled out the table and rearranged my self to get in. (they didn't like that?)  the new booth was in same location next to main door and their main entrance/counter. Every time someone went out we were blasted with very cold air. I nod my head and get our and put on my sweater. \n\nNo big deal. We went on eating our food which was good. When bill came we were wondering why the bill was so big? We added up our costs and came to find out that they were overcharging us. We signed the credit card receipt left tip & notified that manager. He is like you got jalape\u00f1o so that's why. My wife is like ok but it's still higher. \n\nSo she went down to other menu item & he pulled out his menu and checked priced. He is like Yeah its a mistake and we charged you higher. So we were like ok... He starred at us like that was ok? We left restaurant telling him to fix this issue. We are not requesting refund but fix it. \n\nAs far as booth. There were bigger booths in back which were empty and lot quieter area. The ones we were given are for kids hard to get in and not enough place to put food. It's also next to main entrance with cold air blasting your face. \n\nThe shift manager working on 1/1/16 9.30pm was total denial and was just plain jerk.
