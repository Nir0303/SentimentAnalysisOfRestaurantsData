There was no place to put our luggage other then the luggage rack.  We had 2 queen beds which were comfortable.  The bathroom was also small with a sink and shower/tub.  One of those where you have to come into the bathroom move over and close the door so you can use the toilet. The water in the tub did not go down, it backed up to about 4\" high.  We only stayed one night so I don't know if they fixed the problem.  They only gave us 2 towels and facecloths, a little stingy.  We did have the buffet breakfast.  But super overpriced. There were 3 of us and it cost over $40.  You could have an omelet made but I had a cheese one and it was made I am guessing with Velveeta, did not eat it.  It was terrible.  There was yogurt, white or wheat bread, fruit and coffee.  Overall we did not enjoy our stay and were not impressed with the hotel.  The only impressive thing was the huge lobby.  Even though there was a lot of parking we were looking to find a spot when we got back at night.  The hotel was booked solid. Don't know what we would have done if we did not find a spot. It is on a busy street near shopping and restaurant.  Would we stay here again, NO.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-10-23T11:19:00-0400", "location_id": "95875", "id": "182121063", "user": {"username": "krysiaCt", "user_location": {"name": "Colorado", "id": "28927"}}}, {"lang": "zhCN", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2010-02", "title": "\u8212\u670d", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d95875-r77888436-m11068-The_Westin_Williams_Center-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review77888436", "text": "\u8be5\u9152\u5e97\u73af\u5883\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u597d\uff0c\u4ef7\u683c\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u5019\u5165\u4f4f\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u9519\u3002\u623f\u95f4\u5f88\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u4e34\u65f6\u627e\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u623f\u95f4\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u6ee1\u610f\u3002", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2010-08-23T19:09:08-0400", "location_id": "95875", "id": "77888436", "user": {"username": "A TripAdvisor China Member", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
