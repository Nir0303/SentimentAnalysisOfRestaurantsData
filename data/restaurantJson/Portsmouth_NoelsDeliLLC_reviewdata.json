My son and I visited downtown Portsmouth after taking the ferry from Norfolk. We ran in to Noel's for a cold soda. We got a few drinks and an ice cream-my 13 year old loved the ice cream. While sitting there 2 women came in- one in a wheelchair. The woman standing asked what one scoop of ice cream cost. She then got a scoop for the woman in the wheelchair and then Noel wouldn't let her pay. He then insisted the other woman also have an ice cream--on him. Another family came in and it was so uplifting to see how he interacted with the small children and parents. I struck up a conversation with Noel--he is a retired Egyptian cargo ship captain. They just don't make many people like him anymore. I don't know how good his food is but just buy anything and sit and watch. He should be making millions giving seminars on customer service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-07T13:56:32-0400", "location_id": "4889488", "id": "380673627", "user": {"username": "MikeSimone53", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Lupton, Colorado", "id": "33425"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Great Sandwiches", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58083-d4889488-r231015578-m11068-Noel_s_Deli_LLC-Portsmouth_Virginia.html#review231015578", "text": "The place does not look like much from outside but give it a try and you will definitely enjoy.

A delightful lunch!   The menu is limited to sandwiches and pizza but what more do you need for lunch?
