Clean industrial decor and delicious aroma greeted us as we entered.  The coffee and tea selections were wide and varied.  The baked goods were tastefully arranged.  The only disappointment was no pizza during the summer months.  Since I wasn't in the mood for one of their salads, I opted only for an iced caramel cappiccino; which delivered on all levels.  \n\nI'll be back to grab a cookie another time.

But then they added cookies and now a day cannot go by without a trip to the CoffeeBar for a cup of delicious coffee and an out-of-this-world cookie. I am particularly fond of the chocolate chip cookies and the oatmeal-pecan cookies ... oh wait ... and I love the coffee cake ... the ginger-snap cookies are awesome ... oh hell, it's ALL wonderful!  \n\nBut it keeps getting better! They added pizzas that are so incredibly fresh and delicious with interesting and thought-provoking toppings. All the guys that run CoffeeBar are chefs, and it shows. \n\nKeep it up guys -- we're huge fans!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2013-04-10T14:40:08-0400", "location_id": "4062837", "id": "157356145", "user": {"username": "David_The_Blue", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, TX", "id": null}}}]}
