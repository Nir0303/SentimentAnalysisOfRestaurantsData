One of my newest favorites is Pleah-Sach Ko, which is thin slices of uncooked beef with lemon grass, asian eggplant, onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, fish sauce, and lime juice. The combination sounds weird if you have not tried it, but I absolutely love it. Don't be turned off by the uncooked beef, as it cooks in the acidity of the lime juice, yet remains very tender.

Regarding the food, I felt we (two people) didn't give the menu a fair chance. We ordered on the safe side, not wanting too spicey or anything too unusual, this being our first time. As such, our meal was tasty, but seemed average. The eggroll appetizers were yummy and the spring rolls were very fresh. I did not enjoy the papaya salad, but I did enjoy the Amok Trey, (\"boneless Talapia fish, coconut milk, lemon grass, shallots, kaffir lime leaves, broccoli leaves and served in banana leaves; Amok trey is a traditional dish of Cambodian cooking\"). My husband got a beef with asian broccoli.\nRegarding the service: I had called early in the day and was told the restaurant does not take reservations for two. I explained we had theater tickets and would like to come when we could easily be seated; we were told 6:30. Unfortunately this was bad advice and the restaurant was filling up quickly and had lots of parties with reservations. We were anxious to be seated or we were going to leave. The woman in charge made every effort to accomodate us and managed to seat us. The staff was young and I think they could have had one or two more people for service.\nBy the time we left, the restaurant was croweded with people waiting. All types of people were there, so I think this restaurant has broad appeal.
