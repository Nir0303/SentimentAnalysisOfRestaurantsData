This place is located INSIDE the J&J market, but don't let its appearance scare you. These are overall the BEST deli sandwiches I have ever had, including in NYC. They have a zillion combinations or build your own. Either way, you will get a seriously thick sandwich, tons of meat, cheese, and toppings.
