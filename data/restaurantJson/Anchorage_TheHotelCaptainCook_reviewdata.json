This was a last minute trip, we did very little preparation before we arrived.  Louisa was able to book us on several guided tours, reservations at an amazing restaurant that has vegetarian and gf options (go to the Glacier Brew House!), rented us a car to go to the zoo and northern lights--all within 30 min of us arriving!  Highly recommend the All-inOne 5 hour tour from 907 Tours (Susan is the best!)\n\nThe lobby is nice, and has an \"Alaskan\" feel.  We're typically loyal to IHG or Hilton brands, but this is a great 'local feel' hotel.  Several restaurants open for Breakfast, lunch and dinner, many shops in the lobby as well as art galleries; we did most of our souvenir shopping right in the lobby stores; typical Alaskan souvenirs that you'd want, plus a great chocolate shop (Rated Best Dessert in Alaska)\nGreat Wifi-breakfast not included\n\nCubby coffee shop is a quick serve breakfast place, long line in the morning, but easy to get a coffee/muffin/fruit to go!\n\nThere is a pool, as well as a Womens /Mens lounge -they have separate work-out areas, however the pool is co-ed with nice showers, and places to get ready\n\nCatching a cab is very quick w/their bellhop, and all of the tours will pick up at this hotel.\nRooms are clean (maybe need a little update) but the views from high up are gorgeous.  We watched the sunrise over mountains every morning, and planes take off-view was much more than expected.  Room was big enough to add a rollaway bed for our daughter (we had a King room)\nToiletries in room are decent\nCoffee maker in room & mini fridge\nVery little drawer space to unpack, but not a big deal\n\nYou can rent a car easily and inexpensively from the hotel-concierge will call you a shuttle that will pick up right from the hotel.\n\nThere was a conference in the lobby while we were there, chiropractor vendors etc... The hotel is large enough that it didn't bother us. Many additional conference rooms downstairs.\n\nI would recommend for Business or Family trip\nDefinitely would go back, just for Louisa!  She is absolutely one of the best in the business.

It\u2019s too dark.  Most hotels with the Keurig coffee machines leave 2 pods each for caffeinated and decaffeinated so we asked at the front desk in the evening if they would deliver more.  It never came.  However, when I called and explained, they were right there.  There was only 1 bathrobe in the room.  For some reason, the maid took it probably to wash and never replaced.
