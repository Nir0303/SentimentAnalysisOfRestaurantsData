We decide to receive the menu by email and we called our selections in after reviewing the menu.  My husband picked up our food in the twenty minutes that they said it would be ready.  The food we received was very tasty and hot. The fact that it was hot is important to me, I do not like warm food from a restaurant. It makes me question how long it has been sitting. My daughter had enough food for two meals, my husband and I had enough for two.  We were very happy with the quality and quantity of the food.  Something different, which I do remember from years ago, they give you yeast rolls instead of crackers.  My only complaint was, we didn't get fortune cookies :)  \nSome have complained about the interior, I can not make a comment, because this was a carry out.

The WonTon soup is delicious--the broth is so full of flavor.  The sesame chicken is without rival.  All white meat pieces with a delicious sauce.
