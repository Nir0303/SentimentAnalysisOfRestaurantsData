I Googled Jimmy John\u2019s and found it was just two blocks away. I had had only one prior experience with Jimmy John\u2019s, in Savannah, and was hoping to find this one equally good. It was, and more so. I ordered my sandwich with some special conditions: double meat-and-cheese, no mayo, no mustard but extra oil and vinegar. The cashier was handing me my change and at the same time the counter man was handing me a wrapped sandwich. When I looked at him quizzically, he smiled and said, \u201cDouble meat and cheese, extra oil and vinegar \u2013 no mustard or mayo!\u201d the bread is baked right there, the meats and veggies are fresh as well. It was so good, when our meeting was over the next day, we went back and had the same lunch again. Jimmy John\u2019s is a great decision for a fresh, fast and tasty sandwich. I will always look for a Jimmy John\u2019s when traveling from now on, and if I ever give up the practice of law, I may go on the road for Jimmy John\u2019s!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-06-02T06:48:55-0400", "location_id": "4717115", "id": "208508053", "user": {"username": "Rosson45", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
