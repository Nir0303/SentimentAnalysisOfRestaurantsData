Salsa bar offers limited options.  Yes, the ingredients are fresh, but the dishes just don't come together.  And for the price paid, they should be doing a better job.\n\nFirst, you order at the counter and then get a number when your order is ready.  So this restaurant concept is similar to many others in south Florida.\n\nI ordered the chicken fajitas.  I meant to ask for corn tortillas instead of flour, but I forgot.  I wasn't asked which I wanted.  The chicken was grilled to perfection and served on a hot platter over saut\u00e9ed onions and red peppers.  They came with small condiments of guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  Unfortunately, each of these condiments were placed on top of mostly lettuce so there was not enough to make even three fajitas.  \n\nThe Monterrey Mix was primarily a very large burrito served with fried plantains, and a couple other fried items.  The plantains were greasy and leaked across the bottom of the plate, and the burrito was too salty to be edible.\n\nThe steak enchiladas were mediocre at best, as if the steak had been prepared well before hand.  They came with black beans and rice.\n\nLunch for three of us (only one soda, two waters) came to $41.65.\n\nNo reason for us to return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Samuel P, Propietario at Salsa Fiesta, responded to this review", "text": "Hello Layne, we're so sorry to hear about your experience.

The soft corn tortillas were the only highlight. EVERYTHING else lacked seasoning. Even the tortilla chips were land with little or no salt. Same with the guac.

The food is tasty, the service is good and the facility is clean with a very casual atmosphere. The prices are very reasonable making this place a good bargain.\n\nI had never heard of this place before and subsequently found out that they have a half-dozen or so locations in South Florida with a handful of shops in Venezuela as well. There have been a number of these types of places that have cropped up over the past few years in the mold of Q-Doba and Chipotle. They characterize their style as contemporary urban Mexican and they hit their mark pretty well from what I could see.\n\nI came in on a Wednesday for lunch and it was fairly busy suggesting it was not a secret for the locals. The location in a small strip plaza, away from the tourist area on Hwy 1, was in the middle of a plethora of commercial establishments that catered more to Ft. Lauderdale residents. The format was walk-up-and-order. The person who took my order was very personable, knowledgeable and efficient. The interior seating area was reasonably spacious and had a combination of low and elevated tables providing a nice spot to enjoy a meal. I opted for the Santa Fe Burrito in a bowl. I always appreciate it when these tortilla-free options are available. I also appreciated the fact that they had bottled Pellegrino as a beverage option. I was happy with my selection as the burrito bowl was pretty tasty.\n\nThe prices were quite reasonable as my burrito bowl was $8.99. My total bill with tax and a small tip was $15.00. This was fairly reasonable for what I got.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a casual Mexican meal, especially at lunch time, this is a good bet. The food is tasty, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is light and casual with appropriately themed decor. The prices are quite reasonable for the product. I would not hesitate to recommend this spot if you are in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Samuel P, Owner at Salsa Fiesta, responded to this review", "text": "Hello Debbie, We truly appreciate you sharing your feedback with us.
