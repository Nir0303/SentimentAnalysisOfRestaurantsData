Compared to what you would pay for this quality in a big city the pricing is far less than I expected over the years. Good support staff and so on. My only complaint is with the choreography. They use the same choreographer year after year, show after show. He has no training in a number of the dances he is choreographing such as the Vieneese Waltz, sny type of folk or ethnic dancing, Latin dancing such as the Tango.  It is an embaressment to the quality of the rest of the productions. This opera company needs to be using a variety of choreographers who are well-trained in the type of dance they are choreogralphing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-10-25T12:28:37-0400", "location_id": "2641075", "id": "236238838", "user": {"username": "Giavanna B", "user_location": {"name": "Moorhead", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-04", "title": "Quite an accomplishment", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49785-d2641075-r131472937-m11068-Fargo_Moorhead_Opera-Fargo_North_Dakota.html#review131472937", "text": "Top quality singers, staging, costuming and orchestra.
