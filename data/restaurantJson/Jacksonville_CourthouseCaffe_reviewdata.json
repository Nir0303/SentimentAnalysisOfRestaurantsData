There can be one table or 15 tables, expect to have to get your waitress\u2019s attention to order food, get refills, get the check, basically for everything you need.\nThe owner even accused me of trying to get food for free.  I ordered a sandwich without mushrooms and after my second bite discovered a mushroom.  After finally getting the waitress\u2019s attention I asked to get the sandwich remade and then to box it to go since it had taken so long to order and get the food.  They remade the sandwich but only gave me half of it.  When I said that I should have gotten a whole sandwich the owner said that since I had eaten so much of the sandwich before returning it that I would only get half a sandwich.  I had only taken two small bites.\nVery unhappy with the service, the restaurant has a history of slow staff and the food is not worth the frustration.\nOn a positive note, the carrot cilantro soup there is excellent so if they are making it that day it is worth the trip.
