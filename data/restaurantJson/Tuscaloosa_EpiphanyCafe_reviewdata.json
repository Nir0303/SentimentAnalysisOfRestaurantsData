I just had my 2nd excellent meal at Epiphany last week while visiting Tuscaloosa.  I love the concept of farm to table and Epiphany really does this well.  The menu is very descriptive as to what the food item is, how it is prepared and what other ingredients are prepared with the item.  There is a large chalkboard in the main room listing the farms and dairies where the foods are sourced from.  Almost all are local and from Alabama.  And if this isn't enough the wait staff is well educated on the menu items and can answer any questions one has about the items offered that evening.  I could go into all the fresh offerings on the menu or the fantastic wine list or the craft beer selections available, but trust me when I say that this is a fantastic restaurant unlike most restaurants you will find in a town the size of Tuscaloosa.  It is a small plate restaurant and the offerings are meant to be shared like at a tapas restaurant.  It's a very novel concept.
