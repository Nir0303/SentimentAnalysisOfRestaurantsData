We got there on a Saturday night between 8:45 and 9:00 and we were promptly seated as there were very few other people there. I ordered a Saut\u00e9ed Shrimp appetizer, and we got 7 nice sized peeled and deveined shrimp. The problem was they were so over cooked that they were tough as rubber.  We both ordered the fresh Red Snapper which were then informed they were out of, so she got the Swordfish and I got the Halibut. Each dinner came with 2 selected sides and choice of salad. None on these menu selections were priced and they only stated as per the \"market\"  The portions were small but that's ok, I was not that hungry anyway and I prefer quality to quantity. First the salads arrived, my wife had ordered the Caesar and I ordered the house tossed with house dressing. Both salads served us were Caesar and I elected not to say anything and change my thinking to a good Caesar.  I may have done just that but the this salad was generic in quality with little or no taste.  Then the main course were served and promptly may I add.  The fish was cooked correctly and the sides were good but not outstanding.  And now for the final service of the night, the check. Mind you we each had a cocktail and she had house red and I had a beer with the main meal. We had no desert.  After tip the Credit Card got hammered for over $165.00 WOW.  I guess that might be why there was no one else in the place??", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "BluecatWaco, Manager at 1424 Bistro, responded to this review", "text": "We apologize for the shrimp appetizer not coming out to your expectations.  We do our best to cook seafood appropriately and would have cooked another for you, if you had told the server. Our Fresh Seafood Menu is the small extra menu we add to the regular menu.  Yes, it doesn't have the price-since the prices do change.  But on average the fresh seafood entree is priced around $28 to $44. It does come with a salad and two sides.  It does mention on the menu to ask your server for pricing.  I did a bit of research on fresh seafood at a few restaurants but they are not in the Waco area.  Salads and sides are usually extra. Swordfish was priced at $44. Our seafood like Salmon, Sea Bass, Halibut, Snapper, Tuna and Swordfish  are flown in fresh to DFW and delivered quickly to our restaurant on ice by truck.  I am truly sorry for the server not informing you on the price and will let our servers know to better inform our customers of the price.
