I ordered a Large Latte, plain biscuit with grape jelly.  When I got to the window, the latte had flavor added to it and I had no jelly.  I told the employee that the latte had flavoring that I didn't ask for and as typical for McDonalds, they had me pull up.  Why should I have to be inconvenienced if they made the mistake?  Is it that important to get the people behind me through the line when I didn't get what I ordered?\n\nI pulled up and waited 7 minutes.  No latte. I went inside and told the manager I had been waiting outside for my latte, and that's when they realized they hadn't started making the correct one.  How long would I have had to wait before they realized I was still waiting?\n\nTake note McDonalds: your customers do not like having to pull up to wait for food that wasn't prepared, orders that aren't ready, or for an order to be corrected.  You should keep us at the window for just a few more seconds and get it right.  Second-if I have to get out of my car to go in to get my order that you got wrong to begin with, you should offer to reimburse me for something! Third-train your staff on how to make coffee drinks.  This isn't the first time that there was flavor added to my latte. I've started tasting before I pull away from the window to make sure.  (That's how I determined this order was wrong).  A latte has no flavor added. If I wanted vanilla I'd say I wanted a vanilla latte.\n\nI am a frequent customer of McDonalds.  I visit once a day if not twice.  Even of the weekends.  I find your coffee is better than those high priced coffee stores.  I will continue to get my latte and biscuit there every morning (even on the weekends) but I'd appreciate a little more concern about my experience there and getting my order correct.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-02-02T04:04:11-0500", "location_id": "822233", "id": "192840568", "user": {"username": "Ncoarsey", "user_location": {"name": "Greenwell Springs, Louisiana", "id": "40196"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2012-06", "title": "Don't Bother", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40024-d822233-r156485756-m11068-McDonald_s-Baton_Rouge_Louisiana.html#review156485756", "text": "Turn around, find somewhere else to eat.

I ordered a mcdouble and small fries. i went to the bathroom , It was nasty . The mirror was dirty , there was trash all over the floor. After I saw this i walked back into the dining room to look around a little better. Thats when I really noticed how dirty this place was. All the tables and counters looked sticky. Trash all over the place. Hmmm.... I get to the truck of course the fries were cold( ive come to expect that from most fast food places. When I took a bite of my burger it has onions on it. I clearly, told this girl I wanted pickles and ketchup only. So i take it back. I get to the truck again I open up the wrapper and half of the outside of my burger is covered in ketchup. Like they were mad they had to make it again or something. I get so tired of these places not careing at all. Ketchup everywhere. So  again I take it back. Just were sorry. Heck maby an apple pie or some cold fries for 3 trips in this place would have been nice but nothing. They couldnt have cared less. Well , believe it or not i just made the mistake of spending my money at this mcdonalds again. Guess what? Cold fries and A cheeder onion burger for my boyfriend. He opens it up and there on the corner half in half out is a little spot of onions. He takes it back and the cold fries . Just were sorry. I am tired of spending my hard earned money at any place that clearly does not care.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-01-17T14:04:49-0500", "location_id": "822233", "id": "149905675", "user": {"username": "guru4u1973", "user_location": {"name": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "id": "60927"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2012-06", "title": "Very very slow Baton Rouge East", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40024-d822233-r132400475-m11068-McDonald_s-Baton_Rouge_Louisiana.html#review132400475", "text": "This was the McDonalds 1/2 block from Motel 6 Baton Rouge East, after an extensive wait, I left without ordering.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-06-20T13:15:43-0400", "location_id": "822233", "id": "132400475", "user": {"username": "wildwood49", "user_location": {"name": "Kansas", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2012-05", "title": "Dirty beyond belief", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40024-d822233-r129514971-m11068-McDonald_s-Baton_Rouge_Louisiana.html#review129514971", "text": "We went inside for a quick breakfast before getting back on the road and it was TERRIBLE!
