It is not a full service restaurant, you order, you sit, they bring you food.  They seemed ok when we first ordered, but when my order came, she dropped it off and left.   I was quick to realize it was not what I ordered.  I ordered the beef flank and brisket Pho, what I got was a bowl of vegetables and tofu.  I went back to the front where every cook looked at me standing there holding my full bowl, but as soon as they saw me look back, they all quickly turned away.  The runner did the same; she turned and saw me holding the trey, and walked away.  So after a few minutes the girl at the counter finished with the people she was taking an order for, and just looked at me.  I told her this was not the correct item I ordered and told her what I ordered.  She took the tray, told one of the cooks to make me what I wanted and that was it.  No apology, no we will rush it right out to you, nothing.
