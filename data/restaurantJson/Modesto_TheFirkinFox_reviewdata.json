My wife, my daughter and I were wandering around downtown Modesto this weekend and stopped here for snacks and drinks. This place occupies the north east corner of 11th and I street, and has a fenced patio in front great for people watching. An employee of Firkin & Fox by the name of Devry took my second order at the bar. He handed me my drink, I handed him what I thought was a ten dollar bill and walked back out to the patio. On my way back to our table I see him through the window trying to get my attention. I waved him off meaning \"keep the change\", and sat down. A couple minutes later he shows up with forty two dollars change and says \"sir you gave me a fifty\". Devry is a credit to himself and his establishment. If he is the example of the type of person Firkin & Fox employs, they have made permanent customers out of me and my family. This website will not be the only place that I give this review, myself and most of the people I know are working class and tend to go out on the weekend. We share our adventures good and bad and I will definitely be passing this one along. Thank you Devry for your honesty and the killer Long Island Ice Tea.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-06T09:33:13-0500", "location_id": "1209986", "id": "435125458", "user": {"username": "Max S", "user_location": {"name": "Modesto, California", "id": "32724"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Great service, good food.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32724-d1209986-r420518550-m11068-The_Firkin_Fox-Modesto_California.html#review420518550", "text": "The service here was excellent, the restaurant was full with people visiting the Gallo arts centre across the road, but the food arrived quickly, hot and tasty, just what we needed. \nGreat garlic fries, and a good cottage pie with lovely vegetables.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-20T06:47:56-0400", "location_id": "1209986", "id": "420518550", "user": {"username": "Itchie139", "user_location": {"name": "Chatham, United Kingdom", "id": "186312"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Relaxing and Pleasant Spot to Eat", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32724-d1209986-r408990199-m11068-The_Firkin_Fox-Modesto_California.html#review408990199", "text": "Great place to have an enjoyable dining experience.
