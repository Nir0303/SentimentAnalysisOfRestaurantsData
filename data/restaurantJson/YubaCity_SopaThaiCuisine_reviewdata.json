The atmosphere there is great and you can tell that they have a lot of regulars. We started with the wonton crisps, which were cooked perfectly and quite tasty. As we were waiting for our meal, the gentleman next to us leaned over and told us that we must order the Sizzling Asparagus (#67 on the menu) so my husband went with that dish and I went with the yellow chicken curry (#39 on the menu). We always try each other's dishes, especially when at a new restaurant, so I was able to try the sizzling asparagus even though I didn't order it myself. We were both blown away. It was impossible to say who had the better dish because both were equally fantastic. The chicken curry flavor was the perfect spiciness and the dish had generous portions of chicken. We kept swapping food because we were enjoying both dishes so much. There are also many other great items on the menu that we want to go back and try and everything is really reasonably priced!

Loved the ambiance and interior design.  They have Thai style seating (floor & cushions) as well as conventional/banquet style.  \n\nService was excellent!  Waiter and servers were always coming out to ask how the food was etc, and they were lovely to chat with.  \n\nThe food on the other hand... bit questionable as to authenticity.  Not very tasty.  They don't have samplers, so we ordered bit of everything - pad thai, drunken noodles, vege spring rolls, wonton crisps, tofu todd, chicken satay, fried rice, and mango sweet rice for dessert.  Absolutely IN LOVE with the mango and sweet rice, and would go here again JUST for that :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-04-16T11:38:28-0400", "location_id": "1898074", "id": "266099770", "user": {"username": "Anneke A", "user_location": {"name": "MARYSVILLE", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Sopa's story", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33302-d1898074-r260375283-m11068-Sopa_Thai_Cuisine-Yuba_City_California.html#review260375283", "text": "Family run, meaning friends and family are the same at Sopa's.
