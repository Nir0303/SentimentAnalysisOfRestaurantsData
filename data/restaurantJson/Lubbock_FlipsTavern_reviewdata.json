I think that sums it up. \n\nAmazing hot dog selections with Elk and Jalapeno sausages amongst others. Toppings from Kim Chi, tamales, sauerkraut, peppers, onions, red onion compote, crawfish fondue, beef cili, avocado, brie, bacon, pepperoni... the list goes on and on.\n\nAs for beer. Well, that changes with great frequency. What that means to you is that the beer is always fresh, always unique and there is always something new to try.\n\nPinball? THe place is top to bottom decorated with game tops, backs, flippers, you name it. Most of the collection that is being used as decorative only is from a pinball joint in New Orleans that was damaged by the flooding of Katrina. It gives it all a new meaning with a story like that.\n\nThe staff... wow. Hot hot hot hot hot! Lovely ladies who are as friendly as they are lovely. Most are inked by the shop next door (who happens to own the joint) and remember nearly everyone they see. Give Flips a try. Their dog friendly fenced in patio is awesome for sunset sittings with a nice breeze blowing through and roll up windows between the patio and restaurant, keeps you connected.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-23T14:18:08-0400", "location_id": "10062885", "id": "385384111", "user": {"username": "bryanhildebrand", "user_location": {"name": "Lubbock, Texas", "id": "56208"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "This is not your basic hot dog place!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56208-d10062885-r369963540-m11068-Flip_s_Tavern-Lubbock_Texas.html#review369963540", "text": "Awesome dark bar inside and even more awesome outdoor patio.

The menu is primarily focused around hot dogs and sausages, but these aren't just your ordinary ball park dogs.  You start off by choosing the type of dog/sausage you want, then the style you want them to dress it up with.  This ranges from something as simple as a chili dog (still one of the best I've had) to something way more exotic like crawfish, pulled pork, slaw, or plenty of other options.  I've tried quite a few and I have yet to find one that wasn't anything less than excellent.  I wanted to try a few more, but I can assure you that one dog and a bag of chips is more than enough to fill you up!\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty cool too.  It is centered around a pinball theme and even the tables are old pinball machines (you eat right on the glass). The bar is large and well stocked.  There is an outdoor area you can sit in and the entire place has a really open feel.
