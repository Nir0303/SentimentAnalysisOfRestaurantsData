By that, I mean it's not open Mondays or Tuesdays and it doesn't open until 3:30 the rest of the week.\n The selection is small -- about  dozen types of beer in all -- but covers a nice range. I recommend trying a beer flight for a sampling. If you find a brew you really like, you can take home a growler.  (If you want a larger selection, then try Old Main, 2 blocks south.) I also recommend their home-brewed root beer.\nWhat Torrents lacks in ambience -- hey, it's a converted truck garage -- it tries to make for in other interesting ways: 1) They welcome parties, meetings, and book clubs. 2) You can bring in your own food and treats.(All they other in the way of eats is popcorn and chips.)  3) They've begun to invite food trucks to park outside for those who want a meal with their brew.\nThe current schedule is Beastro (gourmet burgers and hot dogs) on Fridays and Rico's Tacos on Saturdays. If they add some more food trucks to the rotation, they could probably go full time. \nP.S. - Most of us locals agree that Rico's offers the best Mexican food in Ames.
