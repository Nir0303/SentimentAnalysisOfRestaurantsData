I will NEVER go there again and suggest anyone with dietary restrictions to avoid the disaster we went through. We actually reviewed them on Facebook and what a surprise - they removed it! \nWe asked the waitress if they could roll the sushi without seaweed due to dietary restrictions. She said no problem at all. Well the guy rolling the sushi started throwing a fit about it acting like we didn't know what we were talking about so they sent this young \"manager\" kid out to tell us there is no way to roll sushi without seaweed. We told him we have had other sushi restaurants do it for us and he started getting irritated and telling us that we can't order off someone elses menu. We asked if we could just get more Nagiri instead of the Sushi and he said that would be fine. We also requested our entire order with no sesame seeds on it due to dietary restrictions. When our order came it has sesame seeds - no big deal - we just needed that set changed to what we ordered. We started to ask the waitress when she excused herself to grab the young \"manager\" because she did not understand what we were asking. He comes out and asks what was going on and before he can even finish talking the guy rolling the sushi started yelling through the restaurant saying that he refuses to remake it and if that's what we wanted then we could just leave. My husband got up and went to the counter to talk to the guy and asked him why he would yell like that across the restaurant. Him and the manager became very threatening putting their fingers in my husbands face telling us to leave and yelling at us saying we were ordering from a different restaurants menu. I told them they had no right being in business if they can not comply to a simply request that could KILL someone. No freakin joke just one of those stupid seeds could kill my husband!\nWe ask these questions up front before we place an order so that we do not have issues like this. They should never have said yes if they could handle them or fixing it when they make a mistake. We have been going to Suki Caf\u00e9 since they opened and I am so extremely disappointed and embarrassed to have been treated how we were and that we have places in our city that treat people like this.\nWe were not unreasonable nor were we rude or demanding.

When I called the waitress to let her know (heaven forbid many people order these and become sick.) She instantly became mad, and told me it's because I did not know what Mussels tasted like. No offer of exchange or refund or even a simple apology. Just blame the customer. After that service became very slow, and what little that did happen was awkward and uncomfortable. Needless to say, we asked for our check to leave. When my money was returned I was shorted 2.00. Which I took from the tip. After years of visiting this place, I will not return.
