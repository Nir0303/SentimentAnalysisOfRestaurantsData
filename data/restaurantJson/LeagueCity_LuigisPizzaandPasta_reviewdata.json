My four year old enjoys pizza and I enjoy trying out different pizzerias. This place is not too far from home and had pretty good reviews so was worth a try. It looks like a nice place to dine in with friends and the food doesn't taste horrible or anything it just really didn't hit the spot. The pizza I expected to be hotter and better than papa johns,dominoes , and Pizza Hut. Sadly it was not. I got home and realized we didn't get our salad with our order and I am pretty sure I was the only customer. The manager was really,really nice and even offered to bring it to me but I said I could pick it up another day. My daughter said the fettuccine Alfredo wasn't the best but not bad. So I guess over all it was average but still looks like it can be fun for a dine in but I am sure I will never know.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-05T17:57:04-0400", "location_id": "8094927", "id": "415162975", "user": {"username": "Beth G", "user_location": {"name": "Dickinson, Texas", "id": "55744"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Great inexpensive Italian food...

Lunch at $5.95 is a bargain with several dishes to chose from.  I went with stromboli stuffed with ground Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms & cheese.  The dough was very good, so I imagine the pizza is good as well.  There's a good marinara dipping sauce on the side.  Lunch comes with soup or salad---the tomato basil soup is very good, tastes homemade.  Served with bread which was probably store-bought, nothing special.  However, there was a problem--the stuffing inside the stromboli was at room temperature.  After a couple bites, I sent it back and they managed to heat it to where, though not hot, it was warm enough to be acceptable.  My waiter did not check with me to ask if it was at an ok temp.  I don't think he was ignoring me, he was young and just seemed timid.  This strip center space is small, clean, but not particlarlly cozy.  A lunch special, spaghetti & 2 meatballs looked good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-23T19:19:01-0500", "location_id": "8094927", "id": "328716203", "user": {"username": "sandydavis", "user_location": {"name": "Ssandydavis@aol.com", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Taste of Italy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56144-d8094927-r323445892-m11068-Luigi_s_Pizza_and_Pasta-League_City_Texas.html#review323445892", "text": "Luigi's has become a favorite for our family.
