Diane Diamantis is an excellent booking agent. She was responsive even on vacation and was extremely flexible to help suit my parties needs. We had 12 people on the \"Prestige\" yacht and our Captain Steve Houle and Stew Kristen made our afternoon yacht ride for my husband's birthday one we will never forget. The captain asked us what we wanted to do and allowed my party to feel very relaxed and free to enjoy ourselves to the fullest. Kristen kept the boat clean constantly, kept our cups full, and gladly set up all the food, drinks, and a birthday cake complete with a toast. If you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to have a very enjoyable afternoon, please consider booking. Thanks again to the team at Tropicalboat and again, a very huge thanks to Diane!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-07T09:37:49-0400", "location_id": "10954290", "id": "425892082", "user": {"username": "BrittanyHBrady", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Great company", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d10954290-r423161830-m11068-Tropicalboat_Charters-Miami_Florida.html#review423161830", "text": "Great company with beautiful yachts and first class service.
