I had a really good burger with a bunch of beer samples - they do flights and you can choose any beer as a 4 ounce sampler.  The beer menu is helpful in that they list each beer's price not only for a pint, but also for the 4 ounce sampler.  So make up your own flight or just taste one by one.  \nGood comfortable, spacious bar with views of several TVs. There's pool tables and plenty of dining room seating.  Service at the bar was very good.\nA couple of drawbacks, the first being as others here have noted, being the noise.  It's just a loud room. It was a decent crowd but not packed and it was still loud. \nAnd then there's the beer.  Don't get me wrong, they have a great selection of craft and cans and bottles.  The problem I had was sampling local beers I found the majority of them were average or below. Maybe it's the state of craft beer today where everyone is trying to trick up every batch so much that most of them are missing the mark.  Anyway, I was hoping for a better mix of \"classic styles\" from local breweries as well as some unique brews.  But it made for great tasting.
