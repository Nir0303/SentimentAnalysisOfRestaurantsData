We are definitely of the belief that all restaurants should not be the same or traditional, we love variety. I saw on your reviews that you like a lot of chain restaurants and we simply are not like a chain.   I wanted to correct a couple of errors in your post, this is common in the review world.  We do not use wheat in our bread, it's whole grain organic spelt flour.  Also it states clearly on our menu that we offer two different salads, and three sides: roasted potatoes with garlic aioli, a seasonal fruit plate, and hummus with grilled bread.  We offer two soups everyday, one meat based and one vegetarian, and you can also get a side of seasoned grilled bread.  We also offer seasonal sides, like right now we have a delicious sweet and sour cucumber, onion, and tomato salad with produce from our farm.  Most of our customers are amazed at the variety we offer for a small restaurant where everything is made from scratch.  There's no excuse for non-friendly service or food that was just o.k. and I find that very surprising as our other reviews say differently.  It sounds like you were in the mood for plain, traditional mid-western food, and that just simply is not what we offer.

The bread and hummus tasted homemade, don't know if they were.  The vegetables and greens on the sandwich were tasty and fresh.  \nMy daughter had a panini (she is okay with dairy) and said hers was delicious as well.\n\nOur sandwiches were so big, in fact, we could only eat half and had to take the rest with us.  \nThey also offer natural sodas and drinks, and organic wine and beer, which is nice.  \n\nThis is actually a grocery with a deli, and tables for eating are in the front of the store.  Although you are eating, basically, in a grocery store, it's still a nice atmosphere, because the store is old and quaint, but clean and well-kept.  \n\nI would definitely eat here again if I go back to Muncie.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-02T11:56:15-0400", "location_id": "4560446", "id": "295058304", "user": {"username": "bianca66", "user_location": {"name": "illinois", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "The greenest place in town to eat and shop", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37356-d4560446-r286877591-m11068-The_Downtown_Farm_Stand-Muncie_Indiana.html#review286877591", "text": "Fabulous local fresh food.

The sandwiches and soups are delicious and wholesome. The ingredients are healthy and fresh. It is also about $8 for a sandwich, but you get what you pay for. It's less of a restaurant than a few tables in a health food store. It's the only place I know of in the area catering to the granola crowd. If you are concerned about what goes inside your body and want organic or vegan options this is a good place to go. My wife loves it because the food is light and fresh. If you like cheap, heavy food this isn't the place for you. A light lunch for two ran us about $22 and it isn't quite full service.
