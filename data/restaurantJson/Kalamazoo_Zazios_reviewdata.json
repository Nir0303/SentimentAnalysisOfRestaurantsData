The executive chef came out and spoke with us during our meal which made us feel valued and appreciated.My boyfriend ordered the porterhouse, which he said was the best steak he's ever had. I ordered some kind of pasta with mushrooms and prosciutto and it was absolutely divine. Of course we each got a slice of the tiramisu for dessert and were absolutely in heaven. If you don't get ANYTHING else here, do yourself a favor and get tiramisu. I understand Zazio's has revamped their restaurant and their menu and we haven't been here since they changed it, so I can't comment on the more current environment, but we both plan to go back when we have time so we can try it and compare.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-21T06:19:15-0400", "location_id": "598467", "id": "366052214", "user": {"username": "Katy B", "user_location": {"name": "Auburn Hills, Michigan", "id": "29571"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Improved ambiance AND food.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42354-d598467-r360382731-m11068-Zazios-Kalamazoo_Kalamazoo_County_Michigan.html#review360382731", "text": "We dined here last night after hearing that both the decor and menu had undergone revision.  The atmosphere is now less formal and more bistro-like.  In the past, we found the pastas mostly overcooked and the mains underwhelming.  Last night, however, we enjoyed the duck pastrami \"sharable\", bread with truffle butter, seafood etouffee bowl with Israeli couscous, and the seafood cannolli (which was not overcooked).  Martinis (limoncello and \"smokey bleu\") were quite good, and the tiramisu and chocolate turnover were yummy, as well. The only disappointment was the tuna (tough). The ambiance was nice, with relaxing music that was not too loud for conversation.

First, the new place looks fresh and very contemporary with the grey and red colors.  Also like the new bistro tables by the windows - looks very New York!  Second, the wine list is great and varied.  What I like about the menu is that you have a choice of having small plates to share with people of you can have a meal.  With the large meal, it is great as the price for each entr\u00e9e is the same!  My sister and her husband had the steak and loved it as you get a vegetable and a starch with the meal.  They said the meal was amazing.  For me, I ordered the chicken and the meal was plentiful.  We all tried the minestrone soup and it was delicious!  It was a great dining experience and will go back again as the value of the meal is excellent.

My wife and I had the Duck appetizer which is smoked and served with flatbread, arugula salad, pickled red onions, and an amazing Apple jam.  Then she ordered the chicken fettuccine and I ordered the chicken quinoa.  Both dishes tasted just fantastic!!  For desert we finished with the Chef's Special which was a chocolate cake with candied pecans and hazelnuts with a scoop of Stout ice cream.  Together the bite was awesome.  The remodel also looks great, warm lighting, new seating areas, opened up around the bar, and also the entryway.
