It occupies the same location as a previous Brazilian restaurant.  Although it obviously is trying very hard to be special and really authentic, in my opinion Minas is unfortunately not quite as good as its predecessor.  Nevertheless, it is not a bad place, and extremely reasonably priced in comparison with other restaurants in the area.  You can get a very good meal for not much money here; it just won't be top flight Brazilian food.  \nOn a recent visit, my wife and I enjoyed our appetizers very much \u2013\u2013 I highly recommend the very popular fried calamari, which is better than average.  The problem is with the main courses.  My wife had the Bob\u00f3 de Galinha, a traditional saut\u00e9ed chicken dish cooked in a coconut-yucca sauce.  I had the Moqueca de Peixe, a fish stew cooked in a sauce of tomatoes, red and yellow bell peppers, and coconut milk.  Both were served in small, oval cassoulet-style terrines.  Although both were quite tasty, they suffered from swimming in too much sauce.  Generally, I love sauce, but in this case, as Larry David would have said on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" it was just a bit \"too saucy.\"  The dessert, a Brazilian-style Pudin de Coco, or coconut flan, was tasty, but quite heavy. Between the two of us we could barely finish it.  \nBottom line:  even though the food wasn't at all bad, we were both a bit disappointed.  Having been to Brazil and enjoyed the food there very much, and remembering the quality of the former restaurant in this same location, we were forced to conclude that Minas is just not quite as good as the real thing.  \nNevertheless, the price was right (by San Francisco standards, of course).  No question, this place has an economically priced menu.  And we found the service to be extremely friendly, helpful and prompt. So if you don't care whether or not the food is the most authentic and best Brazilian style cuisine you could find, you can still enjoy this restaurant for its undeniably tasty dishes and very economical prices.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-13T22:08:17-0500", "location_id": "360108", "id": "326613243", "user": {"username": "Rick049", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": "60713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Quick Dinner but tasty", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d360108-r323763166-m11068-Minas_Brazilian_Restaurant_Cachacaria-San_Francisco_California.html#review323763166", "text": "Stopped here on my first night in SF this trip.
