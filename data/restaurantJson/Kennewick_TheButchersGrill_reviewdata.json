I want a vinegar base (would also accept brown sugar base for sweet) and really like my dry rub and smoke to come through the sauce but there not letting the smoked meat come through. it was just to sweet and overpowering of the beautiful idea of a smoked piece of pork.  The size was great.\n\nBrisket Sandwich:\nSO CLOSE - but I don't know if they have tried to eat their sandwiches but the way that they are currently building the sliders is destroying the bottom bun and you can't pick it up and eat it.   \n\nService and friendliness was there! 10/10\n\nThe recommendation for the slaw and the baked beans was spot on, but I was bummed that it was the best part.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-13T22:15:44-0400", "location_id": "6612579", "id": "228729723", "user": {"username": "Coug8491", "user_location": {"name": "Richland, Washington", "id": "58708"}}}]}
