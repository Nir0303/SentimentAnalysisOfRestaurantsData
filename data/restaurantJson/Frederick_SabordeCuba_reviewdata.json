My girlfriend, who is Cuban, was skeptical, but the moment her Sopa de Pollo came out, she knew it was authentic.  I had the Vaca Frita, which was slightly dry, but extremely flavorful and, along with the rice and beans, gave it the perfect taste.  The beans were the best I've ever had anywhere, no hyperbole.

We therefore ordered two appetizers each and the gents each ordered entrees.\n\nThe sizzling shrimp appetizer is spectacular.\n\nOur friends are conducting a nation-wide search for the best mojito and took this opportunity for more research. On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is \"meh\" and 10 is superb, they judged their mojitos to be 9.5.\n\nWe could not face dessert.

The pernil was a fabulous, tasty pork dish that was both crispy and tender, served with plantains that you can order either savory or sweet. Even the rice was flavorful.
