Good Ice Cream. For a long time I was hooked on the \"world class chocolate\" On my word... I was hooked... Like every week I had to get one of those gallon/pint thingies! The butter pecan is excellent too. But my \"go to\" which I usually get all the time is the vanilla. They used to have a really good one with 3 types of vanillas mixed in but they got rid of it, I think. Customer service is always great too! It's open late which makes for the perfect late night snack spot. Oh and I love, love, love their VANILLA SHAKE!!! It's make very simple with ice cream and milk.. that's it! LOVE IT!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-02T14:33:45-0400", "location_id": "4654476", "id": "400584520", "user": {"username": "csthreatt", "user_location": {"name": "Lancaster, California", "id": "32607"}}}]}
