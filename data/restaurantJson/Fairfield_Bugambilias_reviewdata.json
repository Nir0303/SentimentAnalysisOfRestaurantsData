We had the on-item plate with papuse, with rice and beans. One papusa was pork and cheese and the other jalapenos and cheese. Not too cheesy but the right amount. The place does not have the greatest atmosphere but adequate, and the food made up for it. Courteous and helpful staff. At dinner time it had only two other families, but that is not uncommon in the downtown areas, which does better business during lunch.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-09-01T10:14:55-0400", "location_id": "4467328", "id": "305952381", "user": {"username": "SMChico2", "user_location": {"name": "Fairfield, California", "id": "32367"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Appalling", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32367-d4467328-r282112113-m11068-Bugambilias-Fairfield_California.html#review282112113", "text": "Yesterday accidentally dropped my take-out food going out of Bugambilias in Fairfield, Ca.  I skinned my knee and had to ask for minor first aid treatment from the staff even after I showed them my injury of a skinned knee.  Instead of offering to replace my food that had been lost, I was told that I needed to pay \u00bd of the cost to replace it.  I told them that I did not think that it was right, and was told that they did not drop my food.  I refuse to pay, and they refunded my food to quickly get me out of the restaurant so that the other customers could not hear what was going on. I was furious, and told them that it was not good customer service.  They did not care and was told that since I got my money back I should be fine.  I was not fine. They showed no concern over my lost food, and blatantly only cared about the money, not me as a customer and making things right for me.   I am 62 years old, and have never in my life seen where food or beverage was spilled, either in the restaurant or outside that it was not replaced, with paying again.  This restaurant was insensitive, and greedy.  I know that I did not handle this in a professional, and I don\u2019t care.
