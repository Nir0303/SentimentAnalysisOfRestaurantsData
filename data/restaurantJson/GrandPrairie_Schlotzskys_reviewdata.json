I know shame on me. I tried the turkey avocado cobb, a surprisingly good salad with black beans, tomatoes, goat cheese, eggs, and croutons. My plan when I arrived was to get this salad without the beans because I was thinking who puts beans in a salad but that plan went out the window. After one look and one bite, I was hooked. I loved it. I purchased sweet tea to wash it all down and now look forward to my next visit. \n\nI encourage more visitors to stop by this convenient location on N Belt Line Rd.
