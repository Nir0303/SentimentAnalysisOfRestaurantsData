As a bar, it's cheap, strong cocktails and cheeky, cute barmaids. The staff is so friendly, it's easy to over indulge so eating is necessary. It's a 21 and over bar that happens to serve great food.\nI have yet to eat anything I wouldn't order again. It seems like typical bar fare at first, until you read the ingredients. Marinated chicken breast with fresh mozzarella, basil, tomato and pesto. The bread is spectacular. It appears to be a squarish torpedo roll, but, it's almost flat. The outside crust is extra crisp and what there is of the inside roll perfectly holds the sandwich together. This same bread is used on the Italian (prosciutto, ham, salami) and meatball.  The sandwiches come with regular shoestring fries or sweet potato, a good slaw or a super creamy potato salad like I get in Hawaii. \nThe appetizer and pizzas are all generous and like the rest of the menu, reasonable. A decent charcuterie includes salami, prosciutto, jams, assorted cheese and crostini. It's a great deal at $12. I thought the $12 price was high for potato skins considering the cheap eats on the menu. Until, four is us were served a dozen giant, loaded plate of crispy skinks.the staff is clever and always comes with the condiment tray in hand.
