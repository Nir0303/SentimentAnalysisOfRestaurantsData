I have never had a bad meal at any location of U.S. Pizza, therefore the 'dependable' part of the title.  \n\nOn the flip side, the composition of the pizza itself is not going to make for a memorable meal.  Please understand I do not mean this in any sort of negative fashion - it is simply a reflection of the fact U.S. Pizza serves thin crust pizzas which are NOT overflowing with toppings.  \n\nIn order to describe the amount of toppings as best I can, I'll reference Goldilocks here - the toppings are NOT too many, nor are they too few - they are close to just right.  For my taste, I wish the toppings were just a bit more and then, I think this pizza would be as good as it can get.  \n\nIf you are a pizza fan, it is usually deep dish pizza that arouses the taste buds - not thin crust.  However, U.S. Pizza does thin crust as good as (if not better) than any other establishment.  One area of their thin crust that truly does stand out is the crust - the toasted, crunchy crust has a delightful taste.  \n\nU.S. Pizza also makes a very good salad - a favorite of ours is the salad supreme with ham.  The salad comes with ample amounts of cheese, meat, mushrooms, onions, and green pepper (all of which can be requested on the side).  This salad is large enough to share if you are also ordering a pizza.\n\nBottom line: a visit to U.S. Pizza has never disappointed.
