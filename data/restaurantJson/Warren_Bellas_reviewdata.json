Delicious, hot and value per dollar kills Little Caesars any day of the week! We always order squares so I can't comment on the round. The only small complaint I have....this place can get pretty busy at dinner time and as such, it can be a longer wait for your order (at least for pickup) don't be in a big hurry to get there after placing your order, 30 minutes seems to be the norm lately. I can't complain too loudly because a busy restaurant is a good thing...it typically means it's GOOD!! My last comment is a product suggestion for management: the only item I've had from your establishment that was just kind of eh, was the breadsticks. Maybe change them up a little? Kind of like Hungry Howies or Dominos?
