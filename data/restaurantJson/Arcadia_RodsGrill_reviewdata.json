What's really cool about this diner (other than the awesome staff and food) is that it's kept preserved in a true retro style from when it was originally built decades ago.  It's almost like stepping back in time, everything such as the decor, the booths, the clock on the wall is kept in such great shape; even the vintage heat lamps and the old school cash register.  When you sit down, you'll notice pictures on the wall dating back to the mid and early 20th century to show the history of Arcadia.  The food is good old fashioned American diner eating.  I haven't tried everything on the menu, but the breakfast items were a gold standard for me and the BLT is great is wanting something not as filling, but still craving the bacon!  The pricing is fair and the coffee is always flowing.  I hope this diner is around for years to come.  Try the waffles, they're absolutely delicious.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-18T10:58:07-0400", "location_id": "1167498", "id": "235051204", "user": {"username": "Rob C", "user_location": {"name": "Phoenix, Arizona", "id": "31310"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Standard Coffee Shop", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29105-d1167498-r231630928-m11068-Rod_s_Grill-Arcadia_California.html#review231630928", "text": "I always enjoy patronizing non-franchise restaurants when I can. This one definitely fits the bill and is much loved by the community. I had always heard that they served a superb breakfast so I went for breakfast and was a little underwhelmed. It was fine. But certainly not as good as I expected. The eggs were a little over cooked and the bacon was a bit limp. But it was still fine. Since there's always a line of people waiting to get in for breakfast, I don't think the occasional unimpressive breakfast will hurt them. I would still go here for the service and homey atmosphere.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-09-29T10:06:47-0400", "location_id": "1167498", "id": "231630928", "user": {"username": "kewlbreezes51", "user_location": {"name": "Glendora, California, United States", "id": null}}}]}
