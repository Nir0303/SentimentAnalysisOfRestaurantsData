I found John's Space Age Donuts.  These are definitely the best quality and best tasting donuts I have ever eaten (homemade not included).  However, I have not lived to be 49 and not appreciate good service as well.  In these hard times, a friendly smile and a few kind words go a long way, and in \"MY\" opinion, make the food taste even better.  This place must have been VERY proud of their wares, as they could care less about the people buying them. Here is my experience:  I arrived at the front door @ 05:58 hours (on the nose).  At exactly 06:00 hours, a stern looking lady slowly walked over and turned on every sign, light, etc. and then... unlocked the front door without opening it, only to walk away as if I had not been standing there, dying to see what all that great smelling air was about (insert sigh here).  Two minutes later she decided to wait on me at the front counter.  Then, when I asked for \"hot\" donuts, she explained sarcastically, that there were none, and became very frustrated when I became puzzled about a famous donut shop NOT HAVING HOT DONUTS FOR THEIR FIRST CUSTOMER!!!  Well, since my soft-hearted wife was there, I decided to buy a dozen mixed donuts anyway.  Then, we drove to \"Lamar's\" donut shop over on College, where they greeted us with open arms... and yes, TERRIFIC HOT DONUTS!!  So, the moral of the story is this... Go to Lamar's!!
