I've been back a few times now, and have enjoyed everything - GREAT tots as a side, the tacos are freshly made (soft shell) with a unique combination of flavors - try a combination platter to taste as many as you can!\nMy daughter got the short rib asian nachos during our last visit - made with fried wonton strips instead of chips the flavor was SPOT ON! I had the quesadilla, and the flavor was fabulous!\nLove the staff, they always have a great smile, and the one time something wasn't right it was fixed IMMEDIATELY with apologies.... go often, try everything!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-29T11:34:38-0400", "location_id": "6589749", "id": "322990761", "user": {"username": "Charlene S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
