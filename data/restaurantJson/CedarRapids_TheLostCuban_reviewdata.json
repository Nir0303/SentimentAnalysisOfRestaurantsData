We were in Cedar Rapids on a Saturday night.  The restaurant is downtown which is pretty quiet at that time.  Parking is at meters, free at night, on the street.  Lost Cuban is a smallish place.  Not quite what I expected.   You walk up to a counter and order your food which they then bring to you. There were about 10 or so high top tables.  They had sets of dominos on the counter which you could use to while your time away waiting for your food, not that the wait was exceptionally long. They serve  beer and alcohol, too.  We had  the picadillo which is beef with black beans and the arroz con polo with black beans.   I wanted the maduros but that was one of 2 or 3 sides that they were out of.  The bean were nicely seasoned and picadillo and arroz con pollo were very tasty.
