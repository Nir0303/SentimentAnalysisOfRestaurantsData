Ordering was difficult when it didn't need to be. My husband and I only wanted sandwiches not the \"meal deal\" with sodas etc. Well it was very difficult to get this across to the person taking our order. She would say a word or two then stop and grin for a few seconds at random intervals. She just couldn't get the order correct and the crazy grinning was unnerving. After maybe 5 tries I was able to order a sandwich but my husband was still stuck with the meal (he just gave up and threw away the stuff he didn't want).  Every inch of the place was dirty so we left and ate in the car. Not even good sandwiches after all that. We have eaten at this chain at other locations but we won't even give this place a second chance,", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-18T18:27:52-0400", "location_id": "903176", "id": "374358387", "user": {"username": "OnTheRoadPrincetonNJ", "user_location": {"name": "Princeton NJ", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Its okay", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34571-d903176-r366716989-m11068-Miami_Subs_Grill-Pompano_Beach_Broward_County_Florida.html#review366716989", "text": "This place makes you wait since they cook your food when you order.

The entire trip home we felt grossed out not a fan of this particular Miami subs it may be a long time till ; if we ever go back.
