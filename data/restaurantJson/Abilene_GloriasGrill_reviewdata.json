Located just across the street from the Taylor County Courthouse, this \"hole-in-the-wall\" burger joint is really quite busy during the week with white collar and blue collar patrons.  \n\nTheir menu is simple, mostly burgers and combos.  The burgers come on a grilled bun and taste homemade and all the fixings.  A good portion of fries or tots can be had with any combo.  You order at the counter and get your drink, then they will bring the food out to you.  The staff is always walking around visiting with patrons and collecting meal baskets and trash.  The place is kept very clean.  Don't expect the ambiance to be A+, but you don't really need it to be to have a good meal.\n\nThere hot dogs also come in a grilled but, which is almost unheard of in Texas.  It is more New England style.  They are delicious also.  My kids love them.  \n\nIf you want a delicious burger or a hot dog on a toasted bun, check Gloria's out.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-11-07T05:23:33-0500", "location_id": "4230878", "id": "325045404", "user": {"username": "Doctrknow", "user_location": {"name": "Texas, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Best burger", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30138-d4230878-r313597674-m11068-Gloria_s_Grill-Abilene_Texas.html#review313597674", "text": "We came here because of the good reviews and it didn't disappoint!
