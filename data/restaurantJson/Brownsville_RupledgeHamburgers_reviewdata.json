There are only four tables to sit at in the environs, but they make the best hamburgers for the price in the city!! While there with my brother, we each ate two hamburgers and two soft drinks, enjoying every minute spent in the place. It is just one of those special places every city has and that a visitor must go to!!\nWhen in Brownsville, do stop in and get a hamburger here. It is only blocks from the Gateway International Bridge and you will be surprised at how much the place grows on you!!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-10-17T15:50:20-0400", "location_id": "4719174", "id": "428946149", "user": {"username": "Tecolutla11", "user_location": {"name": "Brownsville, Texas", "id": "60928"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Old School!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60928-d4719174-r427691657-m11068-Rupledge_Hamburgers-Brownsville_Texas.html#review427691657", "text": "Well this place is near and dear to my heart!

I remember as a 16 year-old girl that I used to go to the movies and stop here for a hamburger, which was twenty five cents back then. The owner made them and served them with love. I moved back to Brownsville a few years back. Two years ago, I kept thinking about this place so I went back. The beautiful kindly owner has passed on, but there were several young women making the hamburgers and serving them. The place was packed. I missed the owner and her wonderful hamburgers. They are still cheap, a dollar I think, but something was missing. The owner's love and pride in her hamburgers?", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-09-28T15:59:15-0400", "location_id": "4719174", "id": "423330682", "user": {"username": "Honestjo777", "user_location": {"name": "Ellicott City, MD", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Local Love for Nostalgia!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60928-d4719174-r418177483-m11068-Rupledge_Hamburgers-Brownsville_Texas.html#review418177483", "text": "Locals love this place, the burgers are small, with a thin patty to boot, with a splash of mustard and a pinch of lettuce. There are no frys. all that is cooked are burgers. Grab a bag of chips and a drink to complete your meal. The burgers are simple with zero wow factor. But that's not to say its not good. Its a good small burger with a price you cant beat that starts as low as $1.15!!! \nRutledge Burgers is a small family business that has been around for 94 years and has virtually never changed. It's become a part of Brownsville history locals can relate to. It still remains as small as it has always been. Its literally an unremarkable hallway, 5 feet wide. It still serves up the same small, thin patty burgers they have always been known for. I'll still go back for the sake of the nostalgia. \nThe meal... I would recommend to get at least 2 burgers because they are the size of small WhiteCastle Burgers. I'd recommend the \"Cheeseburger with Ham\" It's a thin burger patty with a slice of grilled deli ham and cheese all for a buck 75! Get two of these, a bag of chips and a cold drink.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-13T12:09:34-0400", "location_id": "4719174", "id": "418177483", "user": {"username": "Tony_T3000", "user_location": {"name": "Brownsville, Texas", "id": "60928"}}}]}
