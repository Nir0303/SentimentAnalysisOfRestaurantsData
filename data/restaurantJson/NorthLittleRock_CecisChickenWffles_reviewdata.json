It is located within blocks of two interstates (I30 andI40) on a side street that is easy to find and access.\nThe food is as the name suggests, although they feature a number of salads as well as the fried chicken in the name.  The side dishes are typical of the food type and include macaroni and cheese, greens, green beans and black eyed peas, all of which are well prepared and delicious.\nThe service is informal and friendly.  You order at the counter and the food and your beverages (no alcohol) are brought to your table.  Portions are generous.  Take out is available and Ceci;s is also on the Little Rock area Chef Shuttle service.\nThe primary reason we visited was the chicken gizzards that are at the top of the menu.  They are very well prepared and cut to remove the tougher parts.  The breading is thin and nicely spiced.  We will definitely go back to try other things and revisit the gizzards.  Those are hard to find here.\nOpen for lunch only.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-20T12:09:28-0400", "location_id": "10335772", "id": "374914957", "user": {"username": "CountVarios", "user_location": {"name": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "id": null}}}]}
