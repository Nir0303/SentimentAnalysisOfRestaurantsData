All of their crepes are made to order while you wait.  The crepes are divided into sweet or savory, and all of the ingredients are very flavorful and obtained locally, if possible.  I had the B.L.T.

My husband really liked the Louisiana hot sauce.  The House Crepe (one of the sweet crepes), selected by one of our dining companions, had bananas, strawberries, honey & Greek yogurt.  While each crepe was fixed and served separately, they were wrapped in foil when we received them so that they all remained hot so we could enjoy them together.

We were not disappointed.  This new creperie is in a small space on the main street in downtown Conway, with ample complimentary 2-hour parking in front and right around the corner.  The menu includes sweet crepes and savory crepes, made in front of you while you wait with fresh, local ingredients.  The House Crepe included a choice of two fruits (blueberries, strawberries or bananas), a \"drizzle\" of your choice of Nutella, peanut butter or local honey) and Greek yogurt.  One of our group had the House Crepe with strawberries, bananas, honey and Greek yogurt, and she loved it!  There were several other choices for sweet crepes.  On the savory side, I had the BLT Crepe with bacon, fresh greens, tomatoes and mayonnaise.  The ingredients were so fresh and it was delicious!  Two of our party had the Morning Lover Crepe with egg, choice of cheese, spinach, bacon (optional) and a choice of hot sauce.  My husband enjoyed the Louisiana hot sauce on his crepe.  The crepes came out in the order that they were requested, but they were wrapped in foil and plenty hot so we were able to wait until all four of us got our orders before we started eating, and no one's food got cold.  The restaurant offered a nice selection of coffees, tea and Italian sodas.  Hopefully, once the owners get established, they'll open a restaurant in Little Rock so we won't have to drive so far for a delicious, fresh meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-30T15:57:39-0400", "location_id": "10796665", "id": "412923465", "user": {"username": "ARretired", "user_location": {"name": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "id": "60766"}}}]}
