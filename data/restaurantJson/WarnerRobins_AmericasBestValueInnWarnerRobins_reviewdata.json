Found out that after 15minutes after check in they would not allow you a refund on the room.  I will never stay there again and I will never recommend it to anyone.  This hotel makes all the other ABV hotels look bad.

My experience at this hotel was one of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel if not the worst experience.  Entering the room there was an awful smell the sheets on both beds were stained it appeared they were not washed from the previous guest, the bathroom......well I posted pictures please feel free to view them.  I went back to the office to express my concerns about the room the lady not very moved with how I felt said there was nothing she could do for me and she could not change my sheets or towels because that was handled by an outside cleaning crew.  Unfortunately I was forced to stay there that night being that it was too late and I did not know my way around the area, but first thing the next morning we were out of the hotel.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2006-07-29T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "217118", "id": "5528012", "user": {"username": "Danira", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, FL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Perfect Location", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35348-d217118-r983977-m11068-Americas_Best_Value_Inn_Warner_Robins-Warner_Robins_Georgia.html#review983977", "text": "This is a very clean and well kept hotel.
