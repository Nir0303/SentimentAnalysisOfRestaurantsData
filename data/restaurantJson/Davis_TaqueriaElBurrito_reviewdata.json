We were in the mood for Mexican and, since the reviews weren't terrible (and the other one was closed on Sunday) we thought we'd try this. Bad call. I wanted something lighter so opted for the taco salad \"without rice.\"  I should have just ordered a chimichanga. The salad not only had rice on it, it was drowning in a heavy, thick sour cream looking sauce, over processed guacamole, and cheese sauce and there was less than a half cup of lettuce in it. It was just loaded with fat and grease and didn't even resemble a salad. Really unappetizing and a total waste of time, money, and calories. I'm sure there are better places in Davis.
