We ordered 10 chicken wings and a 20\u201d Florentine white pizza for 3 people.  I have enjoyed chicken wings for decades and have ordered them at a lot of restaurants in this area over the years.  I would rank the wings we got here as some of the worst I\u2019ve had.  They were small, too greasy, and had very little flavor.  Certainly, at $10 for 10 little drums or flappers, it was not a good deal.  If I were grading Tony\u2019s on just their wings, I would give it a poor rating.\n\nHowever, Tony\u2019s is a pizzeria, not a wing restaurant.  The pizza we got was okay, but certainly not the best we\u2019ve had in that coastal area.  And, I thought the price was too high.  The total price for the pizza was $27 ($18 for the base pizza, $4 for one extra topping, and $5 to upgrade to a 20\u201d pizza).  So, overall, I can only give Tony\u2019s an average rating at best.  However, the location is good, being close to the Capitol Theatre and Coachman Park.  Plus, there are a lot of empty store fronts along Cleveland Street near the waterfront (I hope that improves!) and the dining choices are limited when attending an event.  So, we may stop at Tony's again when downtown and get a different pizza; perhaps their pizzas with meat and red sauce are better.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-30T05:36:43-0400", "location_id": "2700692", "id": "432897981", "user": {"username": "AldebaranFlorida", "user_location": {"name": "Clearwater, Florida", "id": "34141"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Just ok", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d2700692-r430729027-m11068-Tonys_Pizzeria_Ristorante-Clearwater_Florida.html#review430729027", "text": "This restaurant is close to Clearwater Marine Aquarium's \"Movie\" location, and in fact, was recommended to us by one of the Aquarium's staff members.
