The chairs I don't feel will pass the \"Bryan\" test.\n\nFood. Now here is the kicker. I think it is way over seasoned. Let the natural flavors of tomato and garlic gently come through, don't heavy fist it with every seasoning in the kitchen. Cheese? Just the eight amount for Lasagnas and pasta dishes topped with gooey quality mozzarella. Back away from the salt.

Our party of five ordered their food, and it all arrived very quickly at our table, with the exception of my wife's order which was a gluten free Shrimp Florentine on brown rice.  It was delivered about 5-10 minutes, after the rest of our meals.  After waiting this time it was delivered with the wrong sauce.   I went to find our waiter, did not see him so asked one of the other waiters to please send him to our table.  Again, a short wait, and another waiter appeared asked what was the problem, we explained and he indicated he would find our waiter and tell him.   A full 15 minutes later the new dish arrived.  We should have tracked down the manager but could not find them either, the wife had a few bites and when our waiter appeared we asked for to go  boxes so that we would not keep the rest of the party waiting.  We left the restaurant.  The next day, I suggested that the wife try to finish off the leftovers, she indicated that they did not taste right, and that was another reason she didn't finish them the night before.   I tried them, and indeed they were very spicy (not sure that Florentine is spicy), and wonder if we had made someone mad in the kitchen or on the wait staff.  Any way, this ruined what could have been a very nice dining experience.  I have always felt that \"you only have one chance to make a first impression\", so will probably never go back to this restaurant.  They can do something's right or they would not have been in business for 50 years, so good luck to all that go to eat at this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Loyd T, Owner at Orlando\u2019s Italian Restaurant, responded to this review", "text": "I am sorry your first experience was so bad. It sounds like we failed multiple times. Not our norm. We do not have a dish called Shrimp Florentine on the menu, so I am not sure what you got.

We also have shrimp caldo, which is a spicy tomato sauce.
