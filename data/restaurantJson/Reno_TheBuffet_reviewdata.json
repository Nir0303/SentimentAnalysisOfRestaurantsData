Sunday Breakfast Brunch buffets should be a big deal, laid with rows and rows of a restaurant's best breakfast.  This was worse than what you would get at a cafeteria.  The scramble eggs actually tasted as if it came out of a carton of yellow mustard color liquid.  At the carving station, the honey ham tasted as if the smoke was from an oven that was not cleaned, definitely not maple or honey flavor.  It was 9 am, and most of the items on the bar looked as if it was sitting out in the open for a few hours, or it was empty.\n\nI opted for a veggie omelette but did not see spinach or zucchini so I grabbed some from the salad bar.  The cook gave me attitude and said he had spinach, so when I said I did not see it and didn't know, the plate full of vegetables outstretched for him to use, he didn't make a move to take the plate.  I got the impression he expected me to return the plate of vegetables to the salad bar.  Uhm, yeah, not so much.\n\nThis was the the worst Sunday breakfast brunch ever experienced.

Now to the food, if you are here in Reno on a Friday night it is Seafood Night in any casino with good Seafood that is unlimited it is between $25.00 dollars and up...I can tell you I sit here stuffed to the max, the Prime Rib was outstanding,  the turkey was really good, mashed potatoes they were real and totally awesome with the gravey n breads, the salad bar is a place to feast if you are not a meat eater...definitely a joy for us both to not have to cook and just enjoy each other...okay the tea...that's the Holy grail and congratulations to The buffet you are tops in Reno, Nevada and you made it to my top ten out of thousands of resturants I've been to in 35 years it was perfectly blended and refreshing in a full glass of ice...I was in Ice Tea heaven, 5 glasses...time now to roll outrageously outta here...my hat is off to management and excellent staff and beautiful food presentation... this is a must try...I would be surprised if you do not get the same treatment...", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-30T20:01:44-0400", "location_id": "1090789", "id": "423973693", "user": {"username": "Nor8560", "user_location": {"name": "Reno, Nevada", "id": "45992"}}}]}
