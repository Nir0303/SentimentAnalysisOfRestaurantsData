This is not that place. This is the cutesy place the ladies go to when they are on vacation and ditched the kids somewhere else. \nAs other reviewers said, its small. There are about five tables that really only accommodate two people, then five seats along a window counter. Not really the place for a family of four. When I was there for breakfast there were three retired couples and one single man. Everyone looked like they had nothing better to do in the world. \nThere was one waitress. She did a good job keeping everyone happy. She kept the coffee coming, it was not great, but not bad. I ordered the pancakes. It took awhile because I was told they needed to make a fresh batch of batter. Ok, glad I was there on the day it was fresh. I ordered blueberry, but gee, they must be on the blueberry budget plan, because I think I could count how many there were on two hands.  Pretty sad. The bacon clearly was not a fresh batch. It had that \"made sometime in the past week\" look and was all dried out. I did not bother to finish my breakfast. Waste of calories. \nI was there at breakfast. Plenty of parking around the park.  \nMy acquaintances suggested here and Red Arrow, which had a TA review that said \"greasy\". Beats dried out in my book.
