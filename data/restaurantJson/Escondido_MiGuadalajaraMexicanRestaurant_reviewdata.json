Everything posted is true. It is a beautiful restaurant with colorful decorations. The food was extremely good. We went during happy hour so we decided to enjoy some discounted appetizers and drinks. I asked the waiter about the happy hour prices. He either did not know, did not care, or was too lazy to get us a menu. He just said that everything is about 30-40% off. Umm? We ordered two regular margaritas, fiesta Guadalajara nachos, and carnitas nachos. The food dishes were excellent. But, the margaritas were watered down and the glasses had more ice than liquid. When we got our bill, the food dishes were indeed 50% off of regular price. These prices are an awesome value. But, because the waiter would not tell us how much they were going to be, we were still a little anxious. Our bill included a charge for large margaritas with a small discount. We clearly ordered and received regular size. I asked the waiter about the charge. He said that the ones we had were large. No way. There were larger glasses on a few tables around us. I told him I don\u2019t think so, but he insisted. I do not like being lied too.  \nI hope the manager or owner reads this posting. At a minimum, this waiter needs to receive additional training or be put on probation. There is no place in the restaurant business for lazy and \u201cless than truthful\u201d employees. According to our ticket, the server is 2006 FAB. Now I know why he never introduced himself in the beginning of the meal.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-18T15:13:37-0400", "location_id": "822029", "id": "266496152", "user": {"username": "warste", "user_location": {"name": "Goodyear, Arizona", "id": null}}}]}
