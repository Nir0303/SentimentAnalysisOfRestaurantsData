We loved Savannah and enjoyed walking and the trolley ride. The hotel is an old building and the room had a river view and was nicely furnished, It was dark, however this was a feature of the age of the building and was to be expected. We found the staff generally pleasant and helpful. We had booked a package including breakfast and the trolley bus ride around the city. On checking in we did remind the staff member and asked about breakfast and where to get the trolley bus. She did not tell us that we needed vouchers for the breakfast and the first morning we went for breakfast and as we did not have a voucher the server asked me to go to reception to get them. The server handled this empathetically. At reception the staff member gave me the vouchers without any sort of apology. I also thought I had better check if I needed a voucher for the trolley service, which I did. Again this was the organised without any apology. I would recommend that staff are better trained to explain  to guests how the breakfast and trolley ride add ons work.
