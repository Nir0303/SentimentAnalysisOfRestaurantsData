You can sit over there & wait.\"  We sat for about 5 minutes in the small waiting area, watching the continuing confusion over handling what might've been an unexpected dinner crowd or maybe a short staff situation or both.  Then we got up & walked up the street to Backstage Bar & Grill, where the service was attentive & where the food suited our change of plans before the hockey game.

Nothing was done incorrectly it just could have been a little better. \n\nMy wife chose the chicken parmigiana and I did the baked eggplant parmigiana dish. These came with and Italian salad and bread. The salad had way too much dressing on it but otherwise was a nice mixture.

We continue to make sure we visit at least once every six weeks or so, and go back every year and visit for our anniversary. Milano him self is such a joy to be around. So happy and positive. He is always working!!! I absolutely love the Carbonara!! It has to be the best carbonara i have ever eaten!!! The garlic knots are delish, and you have to be careful because you can eat 3 or 4 before you even realized it!! They have great salads, and the house Italian dressing is divine!!! My husband gets the lasagna, or the stuffed pizza. The lasagna is good, the stuffed pizza is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! It is so delicious!!!
