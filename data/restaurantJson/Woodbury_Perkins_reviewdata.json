Unfortunately the Woodbury Perkins has consistently left us wondering why we keep giving them a chance - but we're done - we won't be back, we'll go to Cottage Grove.\n\nRegardess of how busy they are or aren't, you usually have to wait for someone to notice that you're waiting to be seated (not a good sign to start with). The service goes down from there. \n\nOn our most recent trip, the hostess brought us water and said our waitress would be right with us....I don't consider \"right with you\" as more than ten minutes. We placed our order at least ten minutes before a party of 8 came in. They had a different server and got their food about ten minutes before we got ours. As we watched them dig in to their meals, I walked up to the front to speak to someone - who happened to be the manager. He didn't listen to me long enough to hear how long we'd been waiting or any other information before he turned to try and solve the problem (kinda tough to do if you don't hear what the problem is or perhaps what we were looking for in a resolution). He did come to the table and refilled our drinks and went to the kitchen, found our food and brought it out - most of which was cold. The waitress stopped back (never apologized) asked how things were and as I was trying to explain what was cold, she walked away. I talk fast and that was two people who walked away without listening to the problem before they tried to solve it. The manager came back with a plate of potatoes - which were the only thing to that were hot to begin with - it was the rest of the order that was cold, but the waitress hadn't listened. He apologized and said he had taken half off the bill for the problems.\n\nNot once did the waitress stop back after that. According to her name tag, this wasn't her first month or even her first couple of years, so she wasn't new to being a waitress. \n\nWe went up to pay the bill and surprise, surprise, we had to wait. There was a gentleman who had been waiting a few minutes to pay. We found the right change and left it on the register and walked out - never to return. \n\nWe all have bad days and things we don't excel at and I never base my opinion on one visit (good or bad); but this is pretty typical of the service we've had at this Perkins for years. We've given them several chances to redeem themselves, unfortunately they don't seem capable or like they care. \n\nIf you do decide to give it a whirl - be sure to bring a jacket because it's always very, very cold in there (even the guys complain about it), especially if you're not seated in the middle of the restaurant; either of the \"alcoves\" are always several degrees colder than the middle or more open part of the restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-06-01T20:23:28-0400", "location_id": "8469544", "id": "208433506", "user": {"username": "Dawn F", "user_location": {"name": "Woodbury, Minnesota", "id": "43656"}}}]}
