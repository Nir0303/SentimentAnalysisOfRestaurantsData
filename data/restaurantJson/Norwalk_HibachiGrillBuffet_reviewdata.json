We didn't have to wait at all to be seated as there are lots of tables. We were a family of 8 so it wasn't hard to seat us. The place looks clean and you constantly see someone wiping down the buffet line. However the food itself was just average. Typical \"Chinese American\" fare such as lo mein, mayo shrimp, stir fried green beans were available. I personally liked the steamed mussels and crab legs. Though it took a lot of work to get a little bit of meat from the crab legs. Other than that, the food was pretty mediocre. The sushi bar had very limited variety, most of it were variation of the california roll with two or three sashimi rolls and 2 raw rolls. I tried a raw roll and personally thought the fish tasted kind of weird, perhaps frozen or just not higher quality? I shouldn't expect much from a buffet but honestly, Hokkaido is better in variety. The dessert/fruit bar was okay. Fruit wasn't ripe and you can definitely tell which fruit was from a can. Despite the food taste, I had an okay time here. The service was great, the waiter was very patient in taking our drink orders and bringing us napkins and other things. The bathroom here wasn't very clean either. The value of the meal was surprisingly cheap, so that's a plus for this place.

Two things of concern is the employees, are generally unhappy and not organized, especially when busy on weekends. On weekends and evening, you can have a plate of meat and noodles cooked to order, at the grill station. Usually one guy is there and I feel for him but he is not a happy camper, and unless you have alot of patients, or if you get extremely lucky and there is no more than 2 in line, stay away, from that station. Also this place is getting ripped off!! You do not pay until after your meal, at the register by the door, where theres a unorganized maze of customers. I hope the owners read this, and go to hometown buffet, or golden corral, and other successful value buffets, and how people pay, when they first come in, in a orderly fashion!
