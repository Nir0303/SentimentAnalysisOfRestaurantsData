Well I do! After a successful pre-ceremony once through, our wedding party and family guests all headed to Andiamo Italian Ristorante in Eagen, Minnesota on Friday September 23rd, 2016.\n\nAndiamo is easy to find and at the busiest time on a Friday night, the parking lot was a bit crowded. The attendants at the door pleasantly pointed us to the \"semi-private\" group dining area. The \"semi-private\" dining only comfortably housed about 30, but we had closer to 40 adults and kids trying to eat a meal. This wasn't the restaurant's fault, but just so you know, crowding their party room isn't a good idea.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean and naturally dark (what restaurant isn't these days) with simple decorations and a lot of nice wood everywhere. One thing to note is that even in the \"semi-private\" dining area, the background noise of talking and chatter was very loud. Having a conversation with someone right across the table was a bit tough.\n\nAlthough we were eating as a group, every table seemed to have a server assigned to assure we had soda and water glasses refilled. We felt forgotten a few times, but we were still having a good time as a group and didn't notice much.\n\nThe food served was from a small buffet set up in the corner with pre-dressed creamy Italian romaine salad, a coarsely sauced penne regate pepperoni and sausage main dish, seasoned buttered Italian bread, gluten-free lemon chicken and soft breaksticks. For a brief moment I was worried Andiamo hadn't planned enough food for us, but they kindly refilled the buffet so everyone could eat their fill. I didn't try the chicken or buttered Italian bread, but the salad was fresh and tasty. The pasta main dish was really good and had I been here for just a date night out, I would have ordered this dish and had no regrets. The breadsticks weren't the Fazoli's tender, garlic, salty, buttery sort, but still were plenty tasty.\n\nFood-wise I'd highly recommend a visit to Andiamo, even with the very minimal sample on my dinner plate. Steer clear of busy times, service will be satisfactory, but it won't be a quiet meal to restore your Ch'i.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-23T20:01:57-0400", "location_id": "2187977", "id": "421637905", "user": {"username": "Jeb6kids", "user_location": {"name": "Rochester, Minnesota", "id": "43466"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Hmm...not quite.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43022-d2187977-r421491806-m11068-Andiamo-Eagan_Minnesota.html#review421491806", "text": "Noisey and not the romantic ambience I was hoping for but a nice Italian Restaurant with pretty good service.  Not a white tablecloth experience BTW but better than overly casual mom&pop stop.  Extensive menu all seeming in the $14-$20 range if I recall.  Had the Lasagna and their recommended shrimp angel hair pasta entree- name escapes me.  Lasagna was surrounded by an overabundant moat of crushed tomatoes with the lasagna completely lacking in meats and cheese.  We had to actually ask for freshly grated parma vs it being offered at serving.  The shrimp were small, overly garlicky along with the the dish having all but the kitchen sink in it.  The breadsticks were dry, overcooked and goodness seemingly day old whilst the half loaf of bread was moist & fine.  The garlic cheese bread was nice though, perhaps needing a hint of parma and garlic.  Given the lack of meat in all the dishes I would recommend a side of meatballs perhaps to fulfill your protein craving.  I may go back to try the chicken fettuccine yet unsure as neither the hostess nor the waiter recommended such...the waiter encouraged me to select the lasagna instead.
