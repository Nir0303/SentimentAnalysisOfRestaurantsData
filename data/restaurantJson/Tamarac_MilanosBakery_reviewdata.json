We ordered 3 \"cafe con leche\" (american coffee with milk), 2 small croissants and 2 very small little sandwiches. I have to say that we are originally from Argentina, and having lived there for quite some time, we know that what was served at Milano's was a regular breakfast in any coffee shop in Buenos Aires, nothing more. I was really stunt at the price of the \"cafe con leche\", $3 each, not even Starbucks charge that amount. The server/cashier/barista it seemed had the instruction of doing some kind of fancy drawing with the foam of the milk on the surface so it took a little longer to enjoy the cafe con leche with a leaf? or coffee bean illustration. That was unnecessary for this kind of bakery, when the employees are having \"mate\" on the back of the store. It is something that screams \"something doesn't work well here\". I don't know if the original purpose of the new owners was to aim to a different demographics but the store is located on University drive and McNab, Tamarac, not Ocean Drive.

The factura or pastries are usually not fresh.  This time around the experience was similar and they did not even have the coffee machine available to make coffee.  It simply is not well run.  Is there ever a manager there?  Anyone in charge?  We are confident that if management were more visible and had some sort of rapport with the customers, it would be a more profitable business.  It simply lacks care and attention on their part.  I hear hear their steak sandwiches are good, but have never had them.  They need to make a greater effort in customer satisfaction.  If they had a suggestion box it would be extremely helpful.  I would like to see it prosper.
