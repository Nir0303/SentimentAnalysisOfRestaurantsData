The place was fairly full but they were able to seat us right away. As we were led to our table she saw it hadn't been wiped down yet. After standing there for a bit we were able to finally sit.  It took forever for the waiter to come so I had to track down the manager to order drinks. Then waited forever to get them. After my wife arrived to meet us she ordered a Margarita on the rocks. 15 min went by, had to get up again, find the waiter and ask where the drink was. He eventually came back with the wrong flavor and it was frozen not on the rocks.  We ordered 4 tacos and a bean burrito. Waited 35 min without seeing our waiter for refills or food. Had to get up again and find our waiter. 10 more minutes went by and finally got our food.  The tacos were very good- the only reason I gave this 2 stars.  All together our experience took 1 1/2 hours. As we were leaving it looked like lots of people all over the restaurant were waiting on food. \n\nEven though the tacos were good and had lots of TVs for games I cannot go back here. The service really needs an overhaul.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-15T05:56:24-0400", "location_id": "2416587", "id": "289151882", "user": {"username": "Crazyjack555", "user_location": {"name": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "id": "42660"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Should be called Old salted meat", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d2416587-r284776301-m11068-Cantina_Diablo_s-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review284776301", "text": "We gave this place a second chance.

Service has been horrible the first two times and okay during the most recent visit (went as a couple) The hostess, waitress, bartender... someone was always almost topless, one waitress did not give us exact change, drinks were not refilled, some items ordered were missing, ladies were addressed as \"hun\" by James, \"the manager\", just to name a few problems. Yes, this place serves a very good Mexican food, but it takes a little more to have a nice dining experience than just to get stuffed.
