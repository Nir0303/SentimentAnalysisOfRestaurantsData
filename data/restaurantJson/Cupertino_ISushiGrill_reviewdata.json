I suspect they will be out of business within a year. \nTo their credit they are sourcing very high quality fish, including the uni. The rice part of the nigiri sushi is a little odd, they use very very small pillars of rice (maybe just 4 grains deep and an inch long) so you can't really taste the rice. They don't seem to use wasabi under the fish either.\n\nThe cooked items are really disappointing. Examples: \nAgedashi tofu which was unseasoned tofu cubes in a dashi that seemed to be soy sauce and rice vinegar. This dish is supposed to be all about the dashi.\nKaragi Chicken - essentially really small pieces of unseasoned 'pop-corn' chicken. \nSalmon skin hand roll - the skin was burned black, so the roll was really acrid. One bite and left the rest. \nDespite sending all 3 dishes back barely touched they didn't seem to notice or care which si why I think they will not succeed and will be one of the many restaurant casualties.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-24T13:10:19-0500", "location_id": "9770207", "id": "342441973", "user": {"username": "Russell D", "user_location": {"name": "Campbell, California", "id": "32154"}}}]}
