They offer nice size breakfasts for all sized.  As it seems to be favorite for Yale students, the place can get crowded.  The service staff was awesome and the pancakes and scrambled tofu were delicious.  We will be back next time we are in Yale.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-02T03:55:06-0400", "location_id": "414502", "id": "413825819", "user": {"username": "musicandarts", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Loved It", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33851-d414502-r412636391-m11068-Claire_s_Corner_Copia-New_Haven_Connecticut.html#review412636391", "text": "I had eaten here once before but did not review it. This was my second trip. My daughters are vegan and huge fans. I am not so was skeptical. My first trip, I had a vegetarian BLT complete with soy bacon \u2026 it was outstanding. I could not believe how good the bacon was \u2026 and then the fact it was soy, was a nice benefit, I could eat without guilt. On this particular trip, my two daughters and son in law went for breakfast. \n\nI was quite surprised at how many breakfast items were on the menu that were healthy. I went with the two organic eggs, soy sausage and topped with whole whet toast and banana on the side. I could not believe how good the sausage was \u2026. Hard to believe it was soy. I completed my meal with organic green tea with pomegranate. The place was certainly hopping with a line out the door. \n\nEveryone was nice, the crowd was friendly and it was a great ambience, definitely worth a return visit.

It basicaly was a Tortilla Shell with sauce and cheese on it. Misrepresentation at the fullest.  I don't think that is what Flatbread is. However it WAS FLAT. Ugh.  Also ordered the California Burger, their homemade vegan burger topped with lettuce, tomato and guacamole.  When I asked for ketchup, I was told to take it off another patrons table as they had only one squeeze bottle for the whole restaurant. The roll it was served on was past its prime, quite stale and dry.  We sat outside and the girl that brought our food out to us, plopped it onto the table as if she was feeding cattle. So rude.  Being vegan, I tried to like it here, wanted to give it a chance. Total waste of time and money.  Learned my lesson.  Sticking to Edge of the Woods, ION, and G-Zen.
