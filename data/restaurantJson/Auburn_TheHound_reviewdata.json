They open at 9:30am but they let people into the restaurant and seat them before that time. SO if you show up at 9:30, you've missed watching people stand in line starting at 8:30. At 9:30am we put our name on the list for 8 people and were told the wait was appx 45 minutes. An hour and a half later we were told that the previous patrons at \"our table\" had stayed longer than expected causing the delay. When asked why two 4-tops weren't pushed together it seemed that the only place they would seat a large party was at the picnic table and we were forced to wait for that particular space to open. Once seated and starving we asked the waitress if we could order our food with our drink order and were told \"no\" that she had to help \"pace the kitchen because they were backed up\". Eventually the manager came over and told us that our food would take longer than they liked to come out so he was going to send over some complimentary biscuits (4 biscuits for 8 people). Now the biscuits were large, but we had nothing to eat them on! When our food finally arrived I will say that it was good, not really hot, but it was tasty. One person in our party did send back undercooked pancakes - still doughy. Overall, I wouldn't waste 3 1/2 hours on this place again.

I have found there is no wrong choice on their southern inspired menu. The last time I went I got a delicious pork chop, which was one of the juiciest chops I have ever ate. The Hound is located in an old brick building and is decorated with a lot of dark art. This restarting has a wonderful atmosphere with very attentive staff. Their bar is also impressive with a good selection  of craft beer and a great selection of bourbon .", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-16T05:13:11-0400", "location_id": "3159597", "id": "419119859", "user": {"username": "corydean82", "user_location": {"name": "Notasulga, Alabama", "id": "30745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Manly lunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29006-d3159597-r418178612-m11068-The_Hound-Auburn_Alabama.html#review418178612", "text": "The dark and outdoorsy atmosphere of this restaurant reflect the menu perfectly.
