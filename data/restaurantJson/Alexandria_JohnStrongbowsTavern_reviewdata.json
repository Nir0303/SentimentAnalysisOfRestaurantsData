Nice nice folks here. Steak was wonderful, good beer menu. Has a smoking lounge upstairs and you would never know it. I was very surprised when I found out. Met one of the owner and he truly cared about quality. Even better they have a Veteran discount. If in old town give them a chance. Really cool old building to boot.

We just stopped in for drinks, but were pleasantly surprised. For whatever reason, it was pretty empty, but not disturbingly so.  I've read previous critiques of the single guitarist's performance...but I enjoyed it, and didn't mind that it didn't match the \"medieval\" theme (perhaps having had a few beers prior to my arrival lowered my expectations, but I prefer to believe that as a Gen Xer, I like a broad range of music). Anyway, I was psyched by the fact that they had legit German gluhwein from Augsburg! Best possible beverage after a cold walk up from the water front! The bartender was awesome...super friendly and attentive. If you're military interested in Special Forces, check out the upstairs. Didn't eat, so can't assess the food.
