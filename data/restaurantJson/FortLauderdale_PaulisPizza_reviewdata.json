I was waiting for client & saw this pizza place. I walked in and asked if they served pizza by the slice. I ordered two pieces. Client texted me & stated that she was ready for pick up. On way back to clients home. I was eating pizza. He cooked it perfectly. Light golden brown. Great sauce, thick cheese, great peperoni & perfectly spiced. I was in love. A few days later I took some of the girls that work for me over to Paulis Pizza for dinner. We sat down and ordered a pie & wings. Superb. We were all HAPPY. Pauli & his wife were very attentive to our needs. Two fantastic people. \n   In my opinion. Within my top 5 of pizza restraunt. If you are in Fort Lauderdale area. About a 10 minute ride south of Fort Lauderdale Airport. Scope this place out. \nIt is worth the trip.
