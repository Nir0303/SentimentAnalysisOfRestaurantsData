When in Old Town this is one of my favorite places!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-13T12:07:38-0400", "location_id": "1389970", "id": "404997191", "user": {"username": "reeshad2014", "user_location": {"name": "Temecula, California", "id": "33165"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Delish", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33165-d1389970-r397144604-m11068-Public_House-Temecula_California.html#review397144604", "text": "Our server was very knowledgeable. We started with the goat cheese toast with honey and a green salad.  It was great.  I had the salmon special and it was lovely.  Another person at the table had the Scallops and we also had the hamburger.  Everyone was very happy with their meal.  Our server offered us dessert and named the choices.  Nothing sounded good.  Maybe they can shake that up a bit.  Overall, very good and I'd return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-25T21:45:22-0400", "location_id": "1389970", "id": "397144604", "user": {"username": "Beth W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Average food, convenient location for downtown shoppers", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33165-d1389970-r394504403-m11068-Public_House-Temecula_California.html#review394504403", "text": "Had the Kobe burger and asked for medium.

Also, the food was not brought out all at once. My friend had to wait another 10 min to get her chicken dinner. The order was all appetizers and one meal. I was disappointed.
