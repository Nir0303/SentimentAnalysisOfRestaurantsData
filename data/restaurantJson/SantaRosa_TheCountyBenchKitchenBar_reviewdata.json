They certainly haven't let us down with this menu!\nI think we tried half of it. :)\nThe grilled short ribs were amazing, the popcorn+corn was a unique offering, the butter lettuce and Arugula salad was great and aesthetically pleasing with the plums and pistachios. The naan bread was tasty, and the cast iron rice, grains with olives, herbs had some serious depth.\nThe real show stopper was the braised chicken thighs with chorizo and pimenton. Wow and yum!\nHad a delightfully strong mojito and a damn good glass of wine with all that food. Unfortunately, I am not much of a wine drinker so I don't recall what it was, but they have a sommelier on hand to help us beer drinkers keep up...and they offer beer too.\nFinished off with a semifreddo topped with Bing cherries.\nThe decor is cute as hell. I went out on a limb and got a reservation. While they weren't yet full up on a Saturday at 6:30pm, the reservation got us the lone love seat booth that lets you watch everything from the bar, to the dining room, to a bit of the kitchen. It was fun to see the place get crazy busy when all the other people came in to enjoy this jewel on 4th Street.\nThese guys are doing a great job.

Amazingly, downtown SR was hopping. We started with marinated goat cheese with toasted crostini and it was very nicely herbed & spices. [I had tasted the grilled short rib adobo a few weeks back and thought it a good appetizer, if a bit skimpy.\n\nFriend has the Ribeye Steak (for two) and I had the swordfish with hazelnuts, citrus over a very nice broccolini. A very refreshing, well prepared dish. Friends big steak was nicely cooked-- but the cut had some tough spots that could have been dealt with. I was not wild about the 'rub' but she liked it.\n\nCBKB should really amp up their wines by the glass list. There was only one Rose and it was not amazing. This is So Co, there should be 20+ wines by the glass.. and not all local. The second Pinot I got was good, but nothing to rave about. They really promote their sommelier service and bar experience but I think it is a bit limited at this point. The staff needs to be educated about their wines, or the somelier should step in.\n\nSadly, we did not do dessert but everything on the dessert menu looked great. Expresso topped off our nice meal. \n\nI just felt our server seemed fairly new and a little too shy, but she did a nice job overall. Also, I think the owner was there and he could have come over an introduced himself. I just always want a bit more TRUE hospitality for a Santa Rosa dining experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-07-28T10:39:09-0400", "location_id": "10524897", "id": "398501509", "user": {"username": "karendor", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Rosa, California", "id": "33055"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Nice option if you are in the area but not worth going out of your way", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33055-d10524897-r394889618-m11068-The_County_Bench_Kitchen_Bar-Santa_Rosa_Sonoma_County_California.html#review394889618", "text": "My wife and I gave this place a try after hearing someone speak very highly of it.
