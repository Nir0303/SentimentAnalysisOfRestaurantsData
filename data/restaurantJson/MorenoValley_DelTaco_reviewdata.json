With that being said, I WAS a frequent visiter of all the MoVal locations until, I utterly disgusted by this one. So lady in front of me (let's name her Jane) places an order for two tacos then my son, husband, and I place our order. Jane receives her order and as she opens the taco realizes the lady gave her the wrong one. She alerts the cashier and manager so they can swap it out. The taco given to her was one of mine (simple mistake). The MANAGER wraps back up the taco Jane had opened, breathed over, talked over, walked back to the counter with and proceeds to put it in a 'to go' bag. I stood there astonished but not wanting to jump to conclusions that this Manager thinks she's gonna serve that to me! During this exchange another customer was over charged and requested a refund. The manager comes directly from preparing orders (bare hands) to the register, puts in code, and gives customer back the difference. She goes RIGHT BACK TO MAKING TACOS! No gloves, hand wash, not even sanitizer (which wouldn't be sufficient). I watch her preparing what i assume is my order because I am the only person that has ordered tacos with no dressing. She squirts dressing onto the taco, looks up at the order, and WIPES THE TACO ON THE SIDE OF THE METAL PREPARING COUNTER to remove the dressing. That's when my suspicions were confirmed that it was indeed my order she's preparing. I wait until she makes everything and bag it. When she hands me the bag I look at her like she has sprouted seven heads. I asked her if she thought it was acceptable to touch money, touch food, and wipe my food on the side of a counter which I'm 100% sure doesn't get cleaned thoroughly. My husband was done from the money incident. I requested a full refund with a promise to never return, which I haven't. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING coupled with a nonchalant attitude about contaminating my food with dust from the side of the counter and a plethora of germs from cash and the register.
