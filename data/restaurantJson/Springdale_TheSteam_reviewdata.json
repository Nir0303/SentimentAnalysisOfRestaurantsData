Is it a hipster dive bar, an upscale gastro pub, a salad/soup/sandwich, or a higher end restaurant (relative to it's competition in Springdale), a coffee shop even? \n\nDon't bother ordering coffee here. Unless the owner happens to be in there, none of the service staff know how to properly work the coffee equipment. I stopped in for a coffee once on my way back from lunch and the girl handed me something cold that i think was coffee. even though i didn't order a cold drink. \n\nSo what's good here? The food for the most part is excellent. Lunches are there sweet spot. Although I have had the smoked turkey / avocado sandwich that was missing the avocado. the build your own brunch bowl is good. we've only gone for dinner once and brunch twice. but, lots of lunches. \n\nNow we get to the rub. The Service. at best the service is about equivalent to Neals. From the \"welcome to X you can sit wherever you want\" to the general air of unfriendliness. maybe it's a downtown Springdale thing but the exact same level of service can be had around the corner at Spring Street. the waitstaff is under-trained, and just lacking in any type of customer service attitude. go to a similarly priced brunch at Bordinos or Emilias and the service gap is hugely apparent. \n\ni don't want to get into specific details but last brunch my wife and took here was declared to be our last. we sat outside unattended for close to 20 minutes with empty mimosa glasses. then the staff cleared our glasses and didn't bother to ask if we wanted a new one. 10 minutes later we had to ask if our food was coming soon (eggs are still eggs right?). the only explanation we got was \"really busy.\" but honestly, there were like 5 tables in the place. i'd hate to see what would happen if this place was truly busy. and a busy restaurant can cause breakdowns in the kitchen but shouldn't effect front of house service or customer courtesy. we finally got our food a few minutes later and it was very fresh and good, they did leave the mushrooms off my brunch bowl but at that point i was just ready to eat and go. \n\nin summary, i hate to say this, but just get your brunch and dinner elsewhere. still a good spot for lunch. but if you walk in and there are 3 or 4 tables without food you might as well plan on being there a full hour. \n\ni gave it a 3 star but i feel that's a bit generous.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-06T05:10:23-0400", "location_id": "8870674", "id": "415291147", "user": {"username": "George D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great Newer place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31931-d8870674-r412423719-m11068-The_Steam-Springdale_Arkansas.html#review412423719", "text": "We had never been here and had passed by here seeing it was a newer place, we had family in from out of town, so decided to give the place a try.

The fare is mostly build-your-own variety; brunch bowls, pasta bowls, etc., and the food was pretty good.  They also serve alcohol, so it had a bar-like atmosphere. The only thing I disliked was the tab: $55.00 for a family of four, and with two of us drinking waters.  Ouch!  Still, the staff was quite friendly and very accommodating.

Steam is more of a bar and grill.  The restaurant is small, but nicely decorated.  It is almost entirely booth seating, but the booths are very comfortable.  There is very nice soft jazz playing in the background.  The waitress was very nice, and went out of her way to make our meal pleasant.\n\nThe menu had a lot of salads and sandwiches, very little steak and seafood.  Our visit started off a little rocky.  My husband and I are not wine connoiseurs by any  means, but we like what we like.  We first asked for a blush, but they didn't have that.  We then asked for a nice Rose, but they didn't have that either.  The waitress did list off several beers, although they didn't seem to have a  wheat beer.  After several attempts to find something that we liked, we did settle on a nice Blue Moon.  I ordered the Steam house salad and my husband got the steak tips.  I was very happy with the salad, it was very large ( I only ordered a half order) and had most of the ingredients you would find in a Cobb salad.  My husband's steak tips came out in a nice sauce that reminded us of a homemade A1 sauce.  The side was sauteed mixed squash with three new potatoes.  All was very good, although the steak tips needed either some bread or noodles to balance it out.  We did ask for some bread, and the waitress brought out a very nice grilled crustini.  Both the online description of the restaurant and the signs in the shop said to be sure and ask about their desserts, so we did.  That day though, all they had were pre-wrapped cookies, which was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe decor, location, background music and waitress earned the 4 star rating that I have given.  While the food was good, it was not fantastic.  I see a lot of potential in this restaurant and will go back to see how they have improved.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-04-11T07:49:55-0400", "location_id": "8870674", "id": "363357535", "user": {"username": "BethInSiloam", "user_location": {"name": "Siloam Springs, Arkansas", "id": "31924"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Great Place to Eat!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31931-d8870674-r346735646-m11068-The_Steam-Springdale_Arkansas.html#review346735646", "text": "Stopped in for a late lunch and everything was great.
