The ghost stories are a great way for us to sneak in the amazing history of New Braunfels to children. We continue to interview guests who stay and/or work in the buildings on our stops, so that we can continually provide our guests with new experiences.

We are a mixed bunch - most grew up in New Braunfels, two are teachers in NewBraunfels and very familiar Texas history, and two of us have lived here over 15 years. This was the most fun and unique 90 minutes. The guides are very knowledgeable and entertaining. It is very affordable and very appropriate for a varied audience. Several of my friends will do this tour again with their husbands, kids, and one friend mentioned bringing her mom and her friends as she may have eve known some of the german families reference in the tour.

As a local, I learned so many historical events about this great city with the haunting and ghost stories serving as the bow on top of the package.   Anita and Rick catered the tour for our teenage daughter's birthday with 10 of her friends.  The girls had a blast and we were able to rent rooms at the haunted Faust for them overnight to add to the creepy factor.  If you are a visitor, I could see this tour as a great way to get aquatinted with downtown New Braunfels so you have even more ideas of places to visit ( shops, bars, music venues and restaurants). If you're a local, you will be intrigued by all of the hidden stories, tragic events and historical occurrences that have taken place right under your feet. Don't wait, sign up for one of these tours today while the weather is perfect.
