It is the best steakhouse in Folsom and could hold its own with similar restaurants in larger cities.  Mind you, it's not Peter Lugers or Gene & Georgetti, but for the greater Sacramento area it's a cut above the competition.\n\nThe menus is diverse, naturally featuring prime aged steaks, but also offering seafood, a pasta or two, and a few nightly specials.  Appetizers and sides are plentiful and well priced.  The wine list is adequate and a fair value.  On our last visit they waived corkage on two bottles that we brought (it may have been because we ordered a third from them).  Desserts are shareable and delicious.\n\nThe service is enthusiastic - at times too much so - and the courses were well timed and coordinated.  There was an extremely unruly child seated a couple of tables away and our server politely asked the mother to take him out of the dining room until he could remain under control.  He handled it very professionally and when the woman returned the manager stopped to thank her.  This was a nice touch and averted what could have been a difficult situation.\n\nThe ambiance at FSH is warm and friendly.  The dining room is large yet intimate, and the noise level is usually suitable for normal conversation.  The bar is particularly nice.........the bartender was terrific, remaking a drink that one of our party found objectionable.\n\nReservations are recommended; dress is business casual.  The restaurant is fine for older children but not suited for those under 4-5.  It would be fine for special occasions or simply when you're in the mood for a really good steak.
