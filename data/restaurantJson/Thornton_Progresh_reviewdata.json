This was a great thing as he is working on pushing through his fears.  They have ramps, tramps, jumps and an amazing slide area for sliding on blankets or skateboards and scooters.  They are exceptionally gifted at getting kids engaged and Nemo (Ryan) was completely amazing.  We spent 2 hours in the play area and I was thoroughly impressed.  Can't say more!

After a quick intro tour from Tyler, I was able to use the trampolines with a jib board to practice grabs and rotations.  I wish I lived closer and could use this as a way to safely progress park tricks.  Great for snowboarding, skiing, wakeboarding, BMX, skateboarding and more!
