However, as some have already noted, it comes with a steep price for what you get.  I wanted to try this place out since it was nearby and new.  It helped that it had a lot of positive reviews, so I was already prepared for the hit to my wallet.  I ended up buying a Groupon for one taco from the land, one taco from the sea, and one pressed juice for $12, so to me, this was already a good value.\n\nThe cashiers and service staff here are super friendly and very down to earth.  They let me sample all the juices since I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  The kale juice was just ok but did taste healthy (if you consider that a good thing), the Chai Horchata with almond milk tasted the best and was very flavorful, the habanero one definitely had a spicy kick to it at the end that literally lingered in my mouth for about 5 minutes, and the beet one was surprisingly tasty, despite having beets in it.  That was one that sounded the most disgusting to me, but because I was able to sample it, and it tasted pretty good after all, I ended up ordering this one.  So I guess you could say Don't Knock it Till You Try It!  \n\nFor food, I ordered the lobster taco and pineapple skirt steak taco.  My friend also let me try her nacho fries:\nLobster Taco ($12 for full): Yeah, $12 for a taco, tell me about it!  It was pretty good and stuffed with lobster wherever they could fit it!  They definitely loaded this guy with meat.  It was also topped with a lot of guacamole, so if you had a side of chips there was enough to actually eat them with as much guac as they served you.  However, at $12 I think I would rather buy my own lobster at ABC Supermarket and make my own tacos with it.  \nPineapple Skirt Steak ($7 for full): This was very delicious.  The meat was tender, the taco had a lot of skirt steak, and it tasted light yet flavorful.  It was a bit too salty for my taste, but this is a must try!\nNacho Fries: Ask for these super crispy.  They make it exactly as you order, and they were bomb!!!  The fries with very crispy and went well with the rest of their toppings.  I was actually really impressed with the size of the bowl they gave you and even more impressed by how good the fries were.\n\nThe best part about this place is their service staff.  I'm not sure what their names were, but they worked on the night of 4/20/16.  They were the ones that offered the free sample; I didn't even initiate it, and they were just so welcoming and chill in general.  \n\nThey have outdoor seating, so this would be a cool place to go to on a summer night.  My friend liked their beer selection and they now serve Don Perfecto.  Overall, this is definitely a place to try out once, especially if they have a Groupon available.
