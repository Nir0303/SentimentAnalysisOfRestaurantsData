Then we shared the duck with almonds and mole and the beef tenderloin stuffed with chorizo. We had some leftovers to take home. For dessert we had the tres keches cake. It was simple but delicious. The food was great and our overall experience was good. The waitress made it fun.

All the tapas dishes were well prepared and served.  The tastes and portions were incredible.  Even the chips and salsa were a very unique and tasty experience.  Service was fantastic and friendly.  This place would have an unquestioned 5 stars if not for one significant and troubling problem... The place isn't sure if it wants to be a nice tapas restaurant, a casino, or a late night dance club.  I vote for tapas place but unless they figure that out for themselves, real serious restaurant goers may pass on this wonderful place because it appears to not be what it should be.  Judging in the turnout at the casino and nightclub this past Saturday night, it seems that focusing on the restaurant would be the more profitable idea.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-14T08:20:49-0400", "location_id": "6167843", "id": "280139927", "user": {"username": "Bill K", "user_location": {"name": "Frankfort, Illinois, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "EXCELLENT!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36781-d6167843-r279679430-m11068-El_Coco_Mio-Tinley_Park_Illinois.html#review279679430", "text": "The food was outstanding- everything is made there.

My first impressions was that the place looked and felt like a funeral home.  It was dark, only 2 or 3 tables filled and very quiet. The entry dining room could use some festive decor. The host was also our server. We waited a little to get some water. Our server stated that the restaurant had been open for over a year. We put in our drink order but did not receive them for some time apparently due to a printer glitch according to our server.  The people at the next table were apparently not familiar with the tapas concept and went away very dissatisfied, but our experience with the food was different.  We enjoyed an array of 5 or 6 tapas dishes along with the veggie chips and delicious salsa.  Ceviche was outstanding. Bottom line is that the food was good, but some of the dishes could have been warmer. The service was off.  I don't know, maybe they were shorthanded.  It's worth another shot I think.  Please note:  If you're expecting Mexican cuisine and not open to an array of new Central American, South American and Caribbean flavors, then go somewhere else.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-05-26T11:48:12-0400", "location_id": "6167843", "id": "274793031", "user": {"username": "hehldq", "user_location": {"name": "Homer Glen", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "A Great Tinley Experience", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36781-d6167843-r253737348-m11068-El_Coco_Mio-Tinley_Park_Illinois.html#review253737348", "text": "We have been to El Coco Mio a number of times and have never been disappointed.
