We were very excited to do this history run. Unfortunately, the website is very misleading in the experience level needed for the race. It is definitely not \"jogging\". My husband runs marathons and he kept track on his watch - the tour guide was running 8 minute miles. This was not a problem for him, but it was for me. I eventually had to leave the group because I could only jog. Eventually they were so far ahead of us that the guide wouldn't wait anymore. I wanted my husband to enjoy it so I encouraged him to go ahead. Another member in our group made it to the end, but said she really struggled due to the pace. He usually runs 9 min miles so this tour was way too fast. And she even runs races!  \n\nThe guide started off so extremely fast that it was not enjoyable for several people. She was often out of breath when trying to explain one of the sites. She would tell history while we were waiting at at busy intersections waiting for the light to change. We could not figure out what the extreme rush was for. The stops were NOT 3-4 min. \n\nThere was a lot of jaywalking and rushing with the information being told. We also thought it was in poor taste she mentioned she was an attorney multiple times.... And if we got caught jay walking, she could get us out of the ticket. \n\nThe idea and concept of this history race is really unique and awesome. I just wish they offered it in 2 different levels. There needs to be a level for those who cannot run 7-8 minute miles. Maybe 9-10 minute miles? Which is what I would consider jogging? Perhaps make an an actual race (or whatever the guide was trying to do) for those wanting to run that fast. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Tina S, Owner at River City Run, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to leave a review for River City Run and for bringing your experience to our attention.
