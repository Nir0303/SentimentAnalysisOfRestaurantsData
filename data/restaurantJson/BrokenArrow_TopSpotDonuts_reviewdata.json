They taste good, they're fairly consistent, but lack personality and uniqueness. So when I see a place that is NOT Daylight, I jump on it. \n\nThis particular day the staff was stretched thin. Only two people were manning the counter, which is at least half as many people as any other place. Despite the long line and the employees looking like they could use a 5 minute breather, I received excellent customer service! Yes, I'm mentioning customer service first for a donut place!\n\nI had never been here so I asked, \"What's popular?\" The employee showed me a few things and even gave me a buttermilk cruller for free because she said I had to try it! I snagged a handful of other donuts and some jalapeno sausage rolls. \n\nIt was all delicious. I've been dreaming about that cruller and the sausage rolls ever since.
