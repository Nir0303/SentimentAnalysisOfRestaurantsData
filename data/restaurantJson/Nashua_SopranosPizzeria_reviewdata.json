We were told it would take 20 minutes. When we arrived our order was ready and sitting on top of the oven. We drove 3 miles home. When we opened the box 2 of the pieces had slid on top of the rest of the pizza. The pizza even \"looked\" cold. It was barely warm. We didn't need to worry (at all) about burning the roof of our mouth with a fresh hot pizza. If I didn't know better I'd have assumed the pizza was over an hour old. Maybe they had a cancelled or no-show order and just placed this pie back on the top of the oven to warm it up. The sauce, cheese and crust were all cold.\n\nThe bleu cheese sauce with the fried buffalo chicken tenders was really like bleu cheese mixed into mayo. Horrible.
