We decided to eat here based on other good reviews and the look of the place once we were standing in front of it. The restaurant has a great look and feel to it. The sort of place you might expect to have the best Italian meal of your life! \n\nWhile the meals we had were fine, they were far from exquisite. The real problem however was the lack of staff. Any hope you might have of discovering a little gem owned and run by an expat Italian are dashed as soon as the teenager in a t-shirt shuffles up to your table with a bowl of bread but forgets the water. At that point you realize you're in for a very different kind of experience. \n\nI'm an avid supporter of small businesses, only though, if they are really trying and the owner actually cares. There was one server for the entire place on a busy weekend night. There was 7 or 8 tables full as far as we could tell and this one poor server was run off her feet. She was really trying to make it work and very clearly struggled to do the best she could but it was painful to watch. There should have been at least two servers. One person cannot greet, seat, take orders and deliver to that many tables. The teenage boy who gave us our bread we later learned was her son and he was only seen randomly. We assume he wasn't actually on payroll? \n\nWhere was the owner? Apparently there had only been with one server now for weeks. Why was the owner not at the restaurant helping with this staffing shortage? Especially on a weekend. \n\nAs mentioned, we did enjoy our meal and we tipped well as we could see our server was under a lot of stress. This kind of situation though is the kind of thing that would prevent us from going back if we lived there. If this place is going to survive the owner is going to need to become a little more serious about helping out and fixing this staff shortage.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-30T15:01:13-0400", "location_id": "2259638", "id": "305123659", "user": {"username": "alvey5", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Chef is a genius!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45086-d2259638-r289895642-m11068-Cafe_Italia-Billings_Montana.html#review289895642", "text": "I don't usually eat pasta but decided to be adventurous.

The price are reasonable for Billings and the service was pretty good.  There were only two servers to handle the inside and outside.\n\nBoth couples ordered salad and a pizza.  Our Caesar salad was very well dressed and the croutons were tasty.  We ordered a pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and bacon.  It was heavily topped with the meats and cheese and was a little thicker than thin crust.  It was delicious.  The only mishap was the server let our plate the pie on it slip and we lost one slice of pie.  That didn't matter because we still had three slice to take back to our hotel fridge.\n\nI would totally suggest that if you have time, drive into historic Billings and  give this place a try.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-18T21:02:51-0400", "location_id": "2259638", "id": "216154150", "user": {"username": "poppopsilver", "user_location": {"name": "Richmond, KY", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "I Felt Like a regular by the time I left", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45086-d2259638-r215083911-m11068-Cafe_Italia-Billings_Montana.html#review215083911", "text": "It was a Saturday night, first time in Billings and I was walking around getting a sense of downtown, taking a few pictures and running into several stores that I would definitely come back to look around If I didn't have to leave for Missoula Sunday Morning.  I found myself on Montana Ave. around N 27th St and came across several art galleries and a few boutique type restaurants. One was  called Cafe Italia and it beckoned me to pass through it's doors. You would think that with one night to spend in Billings, Montana, I should look for a piece of Montana beef-steak...but hey you don't always have to act like a Roman when you're in Rome...do you?  Upon entering I was cognizant of being made to feel right at home by both the hostess and the waitress. I sat at the bar and had extended conversations with both ( when they had a few free moments) about several of the dishes offered. They asked me why I was in town, and when I mentioned my road trip additional free moments were spent exchanging road trip sniglets. I love sitting at the bar when I eat alone. If you are a people person you always have someone to talk to as long as you can style your conversation to 20 - 40 second chucks while the waitress/bartender/hostess are between helping someone else. My Waitress recommended a great choice for my meal ( Mac & Cheese w/ parmesan/cheddar cheese, prosciutto and bread crumbs) and great wine to accompany the meal. However what was really great was how sincerely nice the people were when I left...I did feel like I was a regular...I felt like Norm on Cheers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-07-12T20:29:56-0400", "location_id": "2259638", "id": "215083911", "user": {"username": "DenwaTulsa", "user_location": {"name": "Tulsa", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great service & Great food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45086-d2259638-r210216202-m11068-Cafe_Italia-Billings_Montana.html#review210216202", "text": "We went for a walk downtown Billings and wandered into Cafe Italia.
