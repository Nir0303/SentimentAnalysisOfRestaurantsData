Next I ordered the Housemade Chorizo Burger, Avocado mayo, cheddar, bibb lettuce, tomato, red onion & charred habanero hot sauce. Definitely different and good.\n\nMy wife ordered the \"Sol Kitchen\" Mahi Tacos,  Napa cabbage slaw, tomato, guacamole, house mojo . Too spicy and she sent it back and ordered the Pontano Arugula salad, Laura Chenel goat cheese, hazelnuts, roasted oyster mushrooms, truffle-fig vinaigrette which is available in a half portion.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-24T05:38:45-0400", "location_id": "1379527", "id": "366838499", "user": {"username": "Rschagrin", "user_location": {"name": "Delray Beach, Florida", "id": "34179"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "The place for Pork!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34179-d1379527-r362652446-m11068-Tryst-Delray_Beach_Florida.html#review362652446", "text": "We enjoyed a delightful dinner in their patio and had delish salads and pork medallions.
