The food is very good and has two different selections a day, along with the regular dishes that are offered throughout the week.  The place is well set up for dining inside or out in the wonderful patio area.  The owner takes the time to welcome you and visit just the right amount.  The service is fantastic and the atmosphere is conducive to making you want to spend more time there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-18T13:25:11-0400", "location_id": "10735207", "id": "407219477", "user": {"username": "TimWW_ELP", "user_location": {"name": "El Paso", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Hidden Gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60768-d10735207-r404606787-m11068-Frutas_Avenue_Fraternal_Social_Club-El_Paso_Texas.html#review404606787", "text": "First off, this place is a little hard to find so I will tell you the easy way to get there: Take the Copia exit and go South to Alameda Street, turn left, go 2 blocks and turn left on Latta St. and you run right into the parking lot.  They have a daily menu that serves two different meals along with a nice variety of sandwiches.  The wait staff is so friendly that it is hard to leave.  It has a nice outdoor patio and two inside dining rooms.  It also has a banquet room that seats 40 to 50 with a small dance floor.  It is the old Falstaff & Mitchells Brewing facility.  We had the home made meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes and bratwurst with purple cabbage. Both were great.  The owner, Walter and our waitress Gloria made our visit feel like home.  You will be happy you went.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-12T10:48:07-0400", "location_id": "10735207", "id": "404606787", "user": {"username": "TimWW_ELP", "user_location": {"name": "El Paso", "id": null}}}]}
