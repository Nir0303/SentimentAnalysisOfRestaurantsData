I have been to this restaurant probably 6-8 times or so over the last several years. (I live 40 mins away so it's not close to home.) It's my kind of place, I like pubs with good food and a good craft beer selection. \n\nMy husband and I went last week for our 11 year wedding anniversary dinner and it was a flop. We both ended up ordering the prime rib, something I rarely get but was in the mood for. It was served with a salad. We got about 1/2 way through the salad and our prime rib was brought out. A little annoying, we were cooped up in a corner on this tiny table that shelved every sauce imaginable ... I had no idea where she was going to set the food down. Not the end of the world ... but then we started eating our prime rib and it was cold. The fries they were served with were also cold. Our meals were $25 a piece, for that price I'm not letting it slide. \n\nSo we waited there at our table for 5 mins, meanwhile our waitress was yackin' it up with the bartender and the other staff, scrolling on her phone about 10 feet away. I didn't have all night, so I had to get up and ask her to come back to the table. She did tell the owner (who we learned had been standing right next to her while she updated her Facebook status), and they both scrambled to fix the problem. I do give the owner credit though, he was very nice and did apologize several times. They heated up our food and said they gave us fresh fries. We're reasonable people, so we accepted that they tried to make it right. I still didn't really care for the waitress, I felt like she should be working at a diner instead of a nice restaurant. \n\nSo the icing on the cake was heating up our leftovers the next day. We each had at least 1/2 of our prime rib left. Sat down at the table only to realize that our pieces were ALL FAT. There were maybe 3 or 4 bites of meat, but that was it. I know prime rib is not a lean meat, but I'm not exaggerating when I say the entire thing was fat. We couldn't believe it, but agreed that they should have noticed at some point how fatty these pieces were at least before they cooked it. So there's apparently no quality control ... \n\nIt will be a long time before we go back, if at all.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-27T04:05:17-0400", "location_id": "2321302", "id": "411359729", "user": {"username": "adshelgren", "user_location": {"name": "Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Prime Rib was disppointing", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g53518-d2321302-r409057966-m11068-The_Ugly_Oyster-Reading_Pennsylvania.html#review409057966", "text": "We usually try to stop in 1 or 2 times a year for the prime rib.
