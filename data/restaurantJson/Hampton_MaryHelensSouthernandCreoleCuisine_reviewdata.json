It was really nice and I enjoyed my jumbo wings/fries. My friend had the sampler platter; she enjoyed but said they should really let customers know that the fish has BONES. They even have drink specials. We are making plans to go back, I'm not sure how many people the place can hold because it is small. But I would guest at least 50 people.
