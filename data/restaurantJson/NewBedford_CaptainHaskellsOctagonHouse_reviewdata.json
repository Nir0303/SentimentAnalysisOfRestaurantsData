The sunroom has an indoor cactus, succulent and palm garden and is very inviting. The dining room has a colorful teapot collection. Marvelous antiques abound, lots of eye candy. The building has so much character, you can't help but feel more civilized when you come inside. \n\nThe location: The Octagon House is nestled in a crowd of breathtaking mansions from New Bedford's prosperous whaling era. If you take the self-guided walking tour, it will lead you on an enriching stroll through the immediate neighborhood of stately -- often stunning -- residences. The location could not be more central: a ten minute walk gets you to the Whaling Museum and the waterfront, a walk in the other direction takes you to Buttonwood Park. It is a quiet, pedestrian-friendly, scenic community with nothing to deter the solo female traveler. \n\nThe personnel: Chuck is a master of thoughtful details. Any comfort you may need is likely already in place, or it will be readily supplied at your request. Chuck really \"made\" my trip for me -- he is the kind of interesting person one wants to encounter while traveling, and he had more historical information and guidance to offer than the folks at the Visitor's Center. He is deeply knowledgeable about the area and can give you any type of recommendation or suggestion you might need. Further, he assembles a lovely breakfast every morning (healthy, with a little bit of decadence -- fresh fruit slices, treats from local bakeries, coffee or tea, yogurt, etc). He has an innate talent for anticipating your needs and exceeding your expectations!\n\nThe sights: New Bedford is an incredible place in itself, but my favorite thing about my trip and my visit to the Octagon House is that I discovered much more than I expected. The area has a rich heritage of cultural and commercial activity with seafaring folk from the Azores and Cape Verde -- this greatly informs the exhibits at the Whaling Museum and it is also reflected in the local restaurants and businesses. If you use New Bedford as a base for exploring the region, there are incredible natural sights -- trails, beaches, rivers, creeks -- and local industry (farms, handicrafts, galleries) that will give you plenty to write home about.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-05-05T06:18:20-0400", "location_id": "612070", "id": "204119928", "user": {"username": "Jennifer C", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Warm Cozy Atmosphere", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60913-d612070-r198255877-m11068-Captain_Haskell_s_Octagon_House-New_Bedford_Massachusetts.html#review198255877", "text": "When I signed up in December to run in the New Bedford half marathon, I had difficulty finding a place to stay in town that would take our beautiful, well behaved golden retriever, Bonnie.

My review of this Inn is written with torn emotion as the owner Chuck, is very nice, accommodating, and knowledgeable about the area, and the resident cats very affectionate.  Each morning the table was set and ready for us with fruit, juice, coffee/tea, homemade scones and biscuits.  \n\nFinding the house is easy enough, but we didn't realize that parking was on the street.  There is one off-street parking spot, but it's on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Inn is located on the corner of a very busy intersection, so don't be surprised to be awakened by the blow of horn.\n\nAs for the house, it appears tired and in need of some necessary updates.  Sharing a door (which was locked on both sides) with Chuck's office, our room didn't have a closet, wardrobe, or bureau, but there was a hanging rack.  We had to get creative with our baggage in order to organize our clothes.  Plus, we were worried that the weight of our hanging clothes would be too much for the wall rack.  The wallpaper in our room was lifting off of the walls and had visible cat scratches on the corners.  The bathroom had original fixtures but didn't have any ventilation, which is necessary.  While a door does open out onto the roof, it opens hard and loud and can't be left open for security purposes.  Also, the exterior door of the two rooms on the 2nd floor do not have locks.  Luckily, one of our friends had rented the other room, so we weren't too worried, but we would have had serious concerns about our privacy otherwise.  \n\nKnowing that Chuck is the sole caretaker of the house, it might be helpful if he brought in a maid or housekeeper to regularly keep up on the dusting, as there was a lot of it around, and to keep switches cleaned, etc. The greenhouse area was in need of a good sweep as well as there were cobwebs under the chairs.  We also noticed a lot of extension cords, and outlets that were not completely secured.  \n\nI last thing that I have to offer has to deal with breakfast.  We were offered an option of tea, which was wonderful.  What we didn't expect was to see a very dirty water warmer show up in the dining room.  I would suggest that Chuck give this a good scrubbing, as it sits next to his stove, or buy a separate unit just for guests.  \n\nOther than that, the bed was comfortable and we enjoyed our time in New Bedford.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-09-19T13:27:11-0400", "location_id": "612070", "id": "177829352", "user": {"username": "Sally Z", "user_location": {"name": "Orangeburg, South Carolina, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-07", "title": "eight ways to relax with doggie", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60913-d612070-r170410569-m11068-Captain_Haskell_s_Octagon_House-New_Bedford_Massachusetts.html#review170410569", "text": "Chuck goes well out of his way to accommodate random travelers with dogs: water bowls and dog resistant comforters appear magically in the room.

Because this guest requested to leave her car during the day after checking out and because the on-street parking was unnavailable that morning due to a parade passing by, and because I needed the off-street space for guests arriving early for the major folk festival going beginning that day, I suggested she move her car to the lot of the building next door with whom I have an arrangement.
