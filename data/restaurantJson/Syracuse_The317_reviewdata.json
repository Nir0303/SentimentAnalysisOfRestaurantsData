I enjoyed the Parsnip bisque with local honey and white Turkish figs.I wish I had gotten something other than the Haddock stuffed with crab. It was good, but needed more seasoning. It was fresh however. The atmosphere is very nice and the service was spot on. Thank you for an enjoyable night out. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-02-28T09:36:26-0500", "location_id": "5002099", "id": "351630980", "user": {"username": "Cynthia C", "user_location": {"name": "Syracuse, New York, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "All excellent and quite tasty.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48713-d5002099-r339011763-m11068-The_317-Syracuse_Finger_Lakes_New_York.html#review339011763", "text": "We were all very happy with our choices ( and the choices the staff suggested...after asking us what we especially liked).\nWe'll certainly be back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-10T14:12:49-0500", "location_id": "5002099", "id": "339011763", "user": {"username": "Hollyrine", "user_location": {"name": "Syracuse, New York", "id": "48713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Hidden Gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48713-d5002099-r335467498-m11068-The_317-Syracuse_Finger_Lakes_New_York.html#review335467498", "text": "The location of this restaurant may be a little off the main drag for business; most people are unlikely to be strolling past and wonder about the place.  (Since I have lived here it has been at least 4 restaurants).  ANYHOW, my advice is to go.  I have had very good food (nice ingredients, beautifully prepared) here every time I have come since the current restaurant has been in place. The menu the last time seems pared back, which I think is a good idea; no bad choices, and everyone enjoyed the meal.  The wine list is well done.  The folks who run the restaurant are present and accountable.

Amuse bouche was a sweet bite of lemon pastry which was also one of the homemade desserts, not a good way to start your meal.  The appetizer selections looked interesting so maybe that would be worth a try, but we just wanted to do entrees and salad.  The warm bread and dip was good, the salad was just some field greens and one cherry tomato with an overly tangy vinaigrette.  The vegetable stir fry with added shrimp was delicious, but the seafood scampi had under cooked pasta that was stuck together.  It had a decent mix of crab, lobster claw meat, and nice size shrimp, with not much flavor.  We had the dessert at the beginning and none of the list had a chocolate flavor so we passed.   Glad to see a couple of finger lakes wines even though they were over priced.  As for service the knife had a big thumb print on it, and we were not offered pepper for salad, or replacement silver with our entrees.  When the check was presented we gave a credit card. The server returned with an ipad type processor which asked you to enter a gratuity while the server watched.  Then he had to go back to the main computer to print out the credit receipt.  The whole thing was awkward and time consuming, not worth the trouble.  They need to make some adjustments if they want to be called a great dining experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-11-27T16:43:34-0500", "location_id": "5002099", "id": "329442757", "user": {"username": "Howard G", "user_location": {"name": "Syracuse, New York", "id": "48713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Yummy!

I believe it changes, so I would go back to see the new items next season for sure! They place was honestly a little too bright for dinner Friday night. A nice dim setting would have been more welcoming. No one greeted us which I thought was weird bc we had a reservation. Oh well we went to the bar where a nice woman served us our drinks and told us we could head to our reserved table whenever we were ready. Our waiter came to our table with amuse of duck wontons. Wow make your mouth water kind of dish! So good. I had the special of the night which was a pork shank, fell off the bone as I was told it would. I also had the made from scratch chili which was wonderful. My boyfriend had the duck leg, it was also great! Just a little fatty but still tasty! \nThis place is priced at about $30 per meal so I wouldn't go unless you check the small menu online before to know you'll find something you like! None the less check out 317 because their chef is very talented.
