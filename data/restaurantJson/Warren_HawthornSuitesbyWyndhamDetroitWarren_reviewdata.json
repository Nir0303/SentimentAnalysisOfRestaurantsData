We wanted a couple extra pillows and were told we couldn't get any because housekeeping wasn't there and there was no way for the front desk to get any- really?  The 'secure' outside doors were not secure at all as the locks were not working. They put a $100 hold on our bank account because they said we booked though someone other than them - even though we did book through them. There were a few other things but the worst was the lack of customer service.  They did nothing to try to fix any of these problems and had excuses for all of them. When I asked to speak to a manager, the front desk employee said he didn't know how to get ahold of a manager.  A manager was finally available (AFTER we checked out) he continued to have excuses (even blaming bad advertising of the corporate office for as an explanation for not getting a jacuzzi).  So, in spite of everything, all management would do was take off 30% of the bill.  Our visit here made a very emotional and heartbreaking weekend so much worse.
