It made us wonder if they were washed between uses, otherwise...yuck.  Service was a little slow, although in her defense, she appeared to be working alone.

It was totally black and carbonized on the exterior, while the interior seemed raw. A Polish sausage, in my experience, is a fully cooked item which requires only reheating.
