The sandwiches were always my go-to, specifically the club, and they were always delicious. The chicken is actual rotisserie chicken, the bacon is thick, and the bread is always delicious. Many of their ingredients are locally grown, and organic, which makes the slightly high prices very reasonable ($8-$9ish for a sandwich alone, no sides included).\nThe employees have always been friendly and the ambiance is local and comfy. The mural on the wall is gorgeous. It does seem a bit awkward that it is openly connected to the restaurant next door, which seems to bring in a lot more noise.\nMy only two issues with Enliten is the abnormally long wait for a sandwich to be made, and the change in breads. I have ordered the same sandwich multiple times, and it is almost always on different bread than the time before. That being said, the bread has always been great, so it's a minor complaint.\nOverall, it's a great local business with quality ingredients that's perfectly located in the little downtown of Provo.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-07T13:57:11-0400", "location_id": "4824604", "id": "390209152", "user": {"username": "Victoria H", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "\"Nice Little Bakery and Coffee Place\"", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57106-d4824604-r382061576-m11068-Enliten_Bakery_And_Cafe-Provo_Utah.html#review382061576", "text": "I stumbled upon Enliten Bakery snd Cafe while walked around downtown Provo.
