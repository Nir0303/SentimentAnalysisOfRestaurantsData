I ate with two work colleagues and I don't think either of them have been back either. The food was mediocre and the service was awful. We arrived at 12:45PM for lunch and consistently felt like the waitress was trying to get us to leave. We ordered beignets after our meal and the waitress actually started collecting our plates while we still had food on them. At exactly 2PM, she even shut the music off on us! Incredibly rude, especially considering that we seemed to be the only customers they had that day.\n\nIf the waitress had come and thanked us for our business and told us the restaurant was closing, we wouldn't have had any issue.

I never would have even gone in if we hadn't planned on eating here.

My date had the shrimp etoufee, which she enjoyed as much as I did my grouper. \n\nThe food was excellent, the service very friendly (of course, she knew one of us) and the overall experience very nice. I found the menu with the exception of the special to be a bit lacking in choices... mostly burgers, sandwiches, soups and salads, but the Friday night seafood event is what will bring me back again. Every Friday, they have a seafood meal that is amazing, the best looking thing on the menu. \n\nThe grouper was extremely spicy; okay for me, but might have been a bit too spicy for a lot of people who are not fond of Cajun cooking. To quote Emeril Legasse, it was definitely \"kicked up a notch\"... the menu listed several desserts that sounded fabulous, but we were both too full to order dessert.\n\nThe only drawback was the price of the special... it was $25.99, which is pretty pricey for a small town like Dothan... with the special though, the entire bill was only about $42 tax and drinks included.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-14T16:20:58-0400", "location_id": "4318853", "id": "228897283", "user": {"username": "aggieband", "user_location": {"name": "Mobile, Alabama", "id": "30709"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Solid Lunch Place- Cajun Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30488-d4318853-r207896212-m11068-Blue_Moon_Cafe-Dothan_Alabama.html#review207896212", "text": "I love the Blue Moon for meeting clients or taking out of towers to lunch, because every time I go I know it will be a good, quality meal that is hot, fresh and tastes good.

Gumbo was as previous reviewer said: Like it was made from a mix? Tasted of too much thyme to me. Was really thick as if the roux was undercooked or was thickened with corn starch. OK so some of you like New Orleans style. I am from NO and this gumbo would not make it there. Gumbo is what you want and expect it to be but in my NO it is a soup with stuff in it rather than a stew. Was also a little hot but that is what some people expect as \"Cajun\". They seem to have changed bread since my last visit. It could indeed now be from WalMart. Shrimp were OK but coleslaw on a Po Boy. Really? I've had them all over NO and never have I seen or heard of that but since it is not  in the Constitution or Bible it is permissible but one must draw the line somewhere. Imagine shredded carrot or fennel would be OK also but would not be NO style. \"Cajun at its' finest\", maybe but I don't think so. \"Authentic\", not in the NO neighborhoods I come from and still return to. Only went here because our friend wanted to try the gumbo since he has tried mine on several occasions. He was only able to eat about 1/3 of his bowl before announcing his as terrible and he is a real honest to goodness sitting legal judge!

My wife's dish was also delish. The tomato grits are to die for. They serve gumbo and several kinds of ettoufe, either by the cup or bowl. Their po boys are also good too.
