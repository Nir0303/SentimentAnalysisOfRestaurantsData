It also comes with your choice of toast, English muffin, buttermilk biscuit, or tortillas. These are one of the best chilaquiles you'll ever have. Since they use their award-winning salsa, the tortilla strips absorb the flavors of the tomatoes, onions, and spices. It has a slightly spicy kick but is not overwhelming. The sour cream adds a creamy cooling quality to finish it off. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nOne Biscuit and Country Gravy ($3) is really a meal in itself. The homemade buttermilk biscuits are gigante! They are light and fluffy and you can tell that they are freshly baked that morning. The gravy has a great peppery sausage flavor with a creamy texture. Rating: 4.9/5\n\nAvocado Eggs Benedict ($12) is two poached eggs on grilled English muffins with grilled tomatoes, two slices of ham, and topped with creamy hollandaise sauce and sliced avocado. The creamy hollandaise works excellently with the buttery avocado. The thick-sliced ham adds a meaty texture and saltiness to the dish. The perfectly poached eggs have flowing liquid gold yolks and the tomato adds a hint of sweetness. Rating: 4.5/5\n\nChile Verde Omelet (look for this as a special) is beautifully made with tender pork chunks in a slight spicy chile verde sauce. The cheese is gooey inside and also melted on top. It is a wonderful fusion of an American style omelet with Mexican flavors.
