Then it got worn down, burn marks all over the booths and the menus were tattered to the point of almost falling apart. Not usually a big deal but it dampens the feel of the place which seems like trying to be a little higher end than a dive. \n\nThe service has also taken a nosedive over the years as well. If you have more than 4 people you are apparently required to buy 2 elite hookahs (no option for buying a large and a small hookah? I don't get that) otherwise you are told you are taking away tables from customers wanting to smoke and need to leave (even when there are 10 empty tables and no one waiting). I would honestly understand on a busy night but when it is slow? And how about some tact in approaching customers? Or openness about this policy?\n\nYou have to go up to the bar to ask for refills because staff doesn't attend to needs, which would be one thing on a packed busy night, except it was slow with a few groups. \n\nBut at least the pizza is good and the chai is tasty. But the customer service left such a sour taste in my mouth I don't think I'll be returning again.
