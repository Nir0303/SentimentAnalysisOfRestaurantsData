I still can't believe I did it.  Here's the deal: the pizza here, in my estimation, is the best in the area, which pisses me off because I hate this place.  The staff always seems distracted and annoyed at your presence, as if patronizing the establishment at which they are employed somehow gets in the way of their good day.  They have no compunction about saying \"what?\" or yelling at you across the room to tell you your food's ready, or, for that matter, completely ignoring your presence.  And about the pizza, it's excellent thin-crust, Neapolitan style brick oven pizza--that is, if you happen to get there at the time that a fresh one is just coming out of the oven.  Otherwise, skip the slice and order a pie, because they let the slices sit out in a little warmer for hours.  Gross.\n\nBut if you don't mind feeling like an annoyance and perhaps getting it stale and burnt, you should at least try the pizza here.  As far as quality pizza goes, Waltham is certainly not a high contender in this department despite the horde of pizza places nearby (Anna's, Lena's, Sabatino's, Prospect Street, Upper Crust, Angelo's, etc. etc.).  It's so convenient that this place is on my street, but I only go if I must have pizza right now!
