The food is a Mexican themed with favorites from the owners successful Cafe Azteca just two blocks away.\nA simple bookstore stocks well-chosen books current in Spanish and in English.\n\nMexican themed specialities are written on a sign board like the SOPA de FIDEO ( a white bean and sausage soup) .  Bread comes from another successful Lawrence enterprise, Tripoli bakery, and appears on the menu with MOLLETTES (Tripoli bread, refried black beans, and Chiuahua cheese).\n\nThese fast meals and snacks  truly reflect the new Lawrence, a town that will produce many poets from the brown paper tablecloths and excellent cuisine of El Teller.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-11-05T06:15:48-0500", "location_id": "3599419", "id": "144589506", "user": {"username": "MASchorr", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-10", "title": "A real treat", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41635-d3599419-r144148487-m11068-El_Taller-Lawrence_Massachusetts.html#review144148487", "text": "We went to El Taller on opening day, it was the soft opening and they were still \"practicing.\"  Everything we tried was an absolute treat, the coffee was excellent and the cappuccino's perfect.  The menu has a Mexican slant though I wouldn't call it Mexican food.  We had something called \"tortas\", a sandwich on local bakery bread with steak, jalapeno's avocado, marinated onions, spice mayo.......  Not exactly sure but it was like no other sandwich I have ever had--so delicious and satisfying.  It could be ordered with a choice of about 5 meats and I think even a vegetarian option.  The menus are on graph paper and you check off what you want, each item having choices and add-ons.  The wait staff then picks it up and delivers the food to the table.  Tables are covered with brown paper to encourage doodling.\nIt appears to be more of a coffee shop/hang out place than only a restaurant.  They have wi-fi, and books to purchase so you can read or use the internet while you dine.  There is a stage so who knows what entertainment activities will come along.  The space is beautifully redone, colors so cheerful, gears and mason jars abound.  They are open morning till night making it a great place to stop in for a little something or a great lunch if you're lucky enough to work in the area.  \nCannot wait for my next visit.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-10-31T06:37:14-0400", "location_id": "3599419", "id": "144148487", "user": {"username": "ei442", "user_location": {"name": "Boxford, Massachusetts", "id": "41471"}}}]}
