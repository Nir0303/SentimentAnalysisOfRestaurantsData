The menu is fairly extensive and typical for a Vietnamese restaurant.  Service pleasant and food came out in a short time.  I was there for the Pho (Fuh).  They have several Pho, with various meats and vegetarian. I had the Pho Deli $9.95, it came out in a huge bowl with condiments on a plate. They have Sriracha sauce and something I call sweet soy sauce (like a toned done hoisin). The condiments were oriental basil, bean sprouts and a wedge of lime. I'm used to having some more lime and less large bean sprouts . The bean sprouts were too earthy for me and I like having chili oil or slices on the plate.  I asked for a pepper thinking I would get a fresh jalapeno, she brought out a piri piri pepper, very nice i crushed it and let in hang out in the broth.  She told me the  Sriracha was hot too.  I'm not a big  Sriracha fan, the heat is there but the taste takes over every.  The broth was great and the meats were fresh and tasty.  There is absolutely nothing like the smell of Pho broth, it is the perfect blend of oriental taste and smell and this was one of the best I've had, Wonderful. They even have a durian smoothie (not for me).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-16T07:57:51-0400", "location_id": "10321523", "id": "383159069", "user": {"username": "Don08251950", "user_location": {"name": "Port Saint Lucie, Florida", "id": "34580"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34580-d10321523-r374200070-m11068-Pho_Deli-Port_Saint_Lucie_Florida.html#review374200070", "text": "Pho pronounced Pha. Easy to miss. Down the side of the Coco Vista plaza near the Asian Market. This is a review of my first visit. Ordered the Vegetarian Pho (soup) for 8.95. She asked me if I wanted it totally vegetarian!!! That was a pleasant surprise. Of course I said Yes! I thought this must be some really amazing soup and it had better be for that price, cause I'm thinkin' it's going to be one of those large plastic containers of soup we get at Chinese restaurants. When they brought out a medium size brown paper bag, I was curious. What's in there? Not just a plastic container of soup that's for sure. The bag was kind of heavy!! Another pleasant surprise when I got it home and started taking it all out. \nThere was a large plastic container with vegetable broth in it, but there was so much more. There was also a large take out container with veggies in it. Then a bag of herbs, culantro, mint, sprouts, a lime wedge and 2 small containers with 2 different sauces. Oh, but there's more!!! Another pleasant surprise. At the bottom of the take out container under the veggies was rice noodles!!!! There was so much to this soup that I got out my old green Pyrex mixing bowl to hold it all. It was absolutely delicious!!! There was so much of it that I was able to eat some for lunch and split the rest with my husband later that day. The restaurant is very plain and simple with a few tables and chairs. I will definitely go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-18T10:00:15-0400", "location_id": "10321523", "id": "374200070", "user": {"username": "msabu56", "user_location": {"name": "Port Saint Lucie, Florida", "id": "34580"}}}]}
