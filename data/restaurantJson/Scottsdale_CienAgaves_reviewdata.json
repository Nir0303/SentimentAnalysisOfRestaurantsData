Seated nearby was another group who was loud and obnoxious throughout our visit.  The servers for our group were well aware of the very disruptive behavior that the other group was demonstrating but beyond apologizing, did nothing to rectify the situation.  The group was behaving in a manner appropriate for a loud and rowdy bar, rather than a family friendly restaurant, with continually yelling and screaming while drinking shots.  \n\nMyself and another person from our group decided to politely ask the group to please lower their volume since we were not able to even converse with the people sitting directly next to us without shouting, which should not be necessary for a restaurant of this nature.  This polite attempt to quiet the group backfired with them being even louder and now making derogatory remarks towards our group.  \n\nAfter putting up with this terrible environment for well over an hour, I decided to ask a manager to come over to discuss the matter with her.  After explaining the situation to the manager, the manager agreed that the restaurant was \"family friendly\" but then told me that there was not anything she could do unless they were swearing and hopefully they would be leaving soon.  I was shocked that the manager of the restaurant was condoning such loud and disruptive behavior from one party and would not even address the concern with them at all.  During this visit, I observed several other small parties being seated between my group and the loud group and after a very short time, those parties asked to be moved to a different table, probably due to the noise, understandably.  Obviously a group of 4 could easily be relocated to a different table but since my group was 19, such a request was not feasible due to the business of the restaurant overall.\n\nBased on this experience, our group will not return to this restaurant due to the lack of regard the manager had for correcting the situation.  It is not unreasonable for a manager to ask a group to behavior in a manner that would be appropriate for the style of restaurant, especially when they were obviously disrupting and detracting from the experience of many other customers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-11-01T12:06:34-0400", "location_id": "1117073", "id": "433723811", "user": {"username": "Debbie M", "user_location": {"name": "Westminster, Colorado, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Great Taco special ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31350-d1117073-r433701723-m11068-Cien_Agaves-Scottsdale_Arizona.html#review433701723", "text": "We were in Old Town looking for a light lunch.
