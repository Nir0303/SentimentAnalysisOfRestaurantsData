My wife and I didn't feel like cooking this particular night so we decided to grab a couple pizzas.  \n\nNow I'm very picky when it comes to pizza. Pops does some things right and some things wrong in my opinion.  The pizza was better than 99% of the other places we've tried since moving to Federal Way but it wasn't 100% what I look for in pizza either. \n\nThey did offer thin crust and that's important to me so that was good but their recipe for their dough was very salty.  The salt flavor nearly  over powers the flavor of the rest of the pie.  The sauce was good.  It had great flavor, I just wish there were a bit more of it on the pizza.  Next time I'll need to order extra sauce.  The cheese was good and spread nicely but they seem to have missed one of the cardinal rules of pizza making which is to spread the toppings all the way to the outside because they migrate while cooking.  The toppings were sparse on most of the pizza and piled up on the other parts.  \n\nI ordered garlic on my pizza and was pleasantly surprised to have whole roasted cloves.  That is a nice touch but I noticed while we waited for our order that they use a conveyor style pizza oven and cook their pizza in round metal trays.  I personally don't care for this method of cooking.  The conveyor oven is fine, that's what I used at Round Table but in order to keep the dough from sticking, you usually have to grease the trays heavily and that makes the crust soggy which it was.  What good is thin crust if it's soggy?  \n\nAnyway, I ate an entire large to myself over the time span of about 5 hours so it couldn't have been that bad. I'll probably order Pop's pizza again.  My wife had a salad and love it.  It was half portion and well worth the price.  \n\nThanks for reading", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-13T19:51:02-0400", "location_id": "4256368", "id": "318443990", "user": {"username": "mrbraae", "user_location": {"name": "Federal Way, Washington", "id": "58471"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Takeout King of Federal Way", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58471-d4256368-r267618639-m11068-Pop_s_Pizza_Pasta-Federal_Way_Washington.html#review267618639", "text": "Everything I have had from Pops is delicious.
