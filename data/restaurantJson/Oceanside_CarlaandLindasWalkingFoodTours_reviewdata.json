Anything from a crawfish boil or burgers on the grill with popsicles for dessert to Michelin Starred restaurants. I simply love food. I came across Carla and Linda's tour while looking for things to do while visiting my dad and stepmom in nearby Vista. Wow, did I strike foodie gold - or caviar if you wish! \nLinda went out of her way to accommodate us on a day that had no tours scheduled, happily arranging a tour us. I am still talking to everyone I know about what in unbelievable time we had! 4 restaurants ( started with dessert! I'm *always* down for that!) in 3 plus hours. Each place will blow you away with great food, but much more that that. You'll meet the chefs, learn of their backgrounds and cooking roots, find out the history of the  establishment and its role within the town. Clever, inventive food that's packed with flavor, some presented in great new ways. Linda and Carla are not only citizens of this town, they are part of the fabric of this developing, vibrant scene. Chefs, entrepreneurs, artists and musicians seems to be everywhere, all overlapping, relating, sharing and creating a warm, nurturing and creative city. When you are done with your tour, you will feel part of this, like an insider - not just in the foodie world of Oceanside, but all of it. \n\nTruly one of the most unique thing that I've had the pleasure of doing in any city. Yeah, you'll leave full, but also enriched by the experience, like you know a great new secret that you can't wait to share. \n\nEven if you *think *you know Oceanside, think again. Book a tour. It'll be the most fun you've had in a while. And probably the coolest thing in a long while!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "walkingfoodtour, Owner at Carla and Linda&#39;s Walking Food Tours, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you Chris.
