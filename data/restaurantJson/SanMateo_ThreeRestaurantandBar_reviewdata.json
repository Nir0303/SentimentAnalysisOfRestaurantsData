So when we do the food has to be worth eating. My experience around these parts is pretty just ok food.  Last night we tried some place new and it was a winner!  This is a new place, I am not sure how new but has opened within the past 3 months?  This is located in the pleasant but getting more crowded San Mateo downtown. This particular block has been kind of sleepy but business is picking up, parking is pretty ridiculous so be prepared to hunt for parking, use one of the ramps and walk, it is safe to walk by ones self here, not really a prob, just be forewarned. \nThe restaurant is lucky enough to have a curb cut out so you can drop off your crew in a safe spot before running off to find parking.  \nWe had called for reservations, it opens at 5:30 so if you call before then you go to voice jail, but you can use Open Table on line. When we walked in every single seat at the long winding bar was taken and all the bar tables, with the tall  chairs were also occupied and all were eating!  We later informed by the waiter that dishes are intended for one an there if there are 2 prices listed, 2 sizes are available, more on this later. \nThe place is brand new and the atmosphere is joyous!  Nice lighting with twinkle lights and two walls with colorful chalk menu items.  They were extremely accommodating to families with children, we were seated nest to several adults with 4 kids under the age of 5.  Rather well behaved but they were still small kids!  \nThe menu is a paper menu folded up into 4s and packed with items.  It took us a long time to look over everything and as I sit here now, a day later, I see so many things I missed last night!  (There is generous lighting and the menu is written in bold typeface so people who need readers can read the menu) There were so  many items we wanted to try but we were under a time constraint of picking up high school student later in the evening.  So we skipped dessert! When we ordered it the duo pricing on the menu was explained! After I gave my order, I asked the waiter that I also wanted, but did not see on the menu, the, what looked like, sweet potatoe chips on the table next to us!  IT comes instead of bread!!  OH and they were good!  Hot to the table with a dash of cinnamon and sugar!!  The waiter kindly brought us out several serving of chips!! We age them.I had 3 onion soup.  It was delish, not the best every but good.  What I liked is that it came in a small bowl, with a small crouton, bread piece, covered by a THIN slice of cheese.  I love french onion soup, I have it nearly every time I can, but most of the time, it comes in a caldron, with a hugh piece of bread  and 1/2 of cheese.  So this was just a perfect size for a normal person and I was delighted!  Even with Several passings around the table to share, it was a goodly portion. I also had the BBQ Pulled Pork tacos, gluten Free!  The corn  tortillas themselves were only the small side, maybe 3-4 inches but they were mounded with a lovely spicy pulled pork, with pickled onions,  I didn't think I could eat all three but I took one for the team!  I had more success picking them up to eat once I ate half the meat with a fork!  Good to great!  \nTwo of our party shared the large size Briased lamb Shepherd's pie.  This came in what I would call a souffl\u00e9 dish, it was huge and mounded to the rim with mashed potatoes.  This was given rave reviews!  Lamb was lamb, not mutton, nicely seasoned, much enjoyed and much taken home for leftovers!! \nAnother shared dish was Seafood Cioppino with Fresh Pasta.  The two who shared this could not stop raving about the actual pasta!  They had a double order and it was large it was not as large in proportion to the Sheperd's pie.  Much enjoyment was had.  \nWE also had Blue Gnocc -n- Cheese with the skirt steak.  Big pillows of Gnocchi with lots of Blue Cheese sauce.  Pretty gooey to satisfy the blue cheese/mac-cheese among us.  The Skirt steak was requested as well done and it was, nice char, nice flavor and satisfying.  We also ordered the cheesy garlic foccacia, thought it would be a nice accompaniment to the sheperds pie.  When we were served 4 small triangles of cheese smothered toast, it seemed a bit tiny.  However each little square was packed with cheesy garlicky goodness. Because all the food was abundant, we actaully didn't manage to eat the 4th piece.  Really packed a punch!  \nService was very attentive. Waiters as well as servers and busers abounded. \nThe place was a little too lively in sound for me.  I personally don't like when I have to struggle to hear or be heard.  I enjoyed my time and my meal there and like I said this is a keeper, because the food was so good, the menu so varied and there is so much to try, we be going back!!    \nThey also have round tables,  I think round tables are more conducive to conversation!!!  They also had a section where they could put long tables together for large parties!!  \nPretty amazing and amusing drink menu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-24T13:30:20-0400", "location_id": "5073404", "id": "431323053", "user": {"username": "PaulaM549", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": "60713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Food is to die for.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33031-d5073404-r431274985-m11068-Three_Restaurant_and_Bar-San_Mateo_California.html#review431274985", "text": "Went there on a business trip in September (we went for lunch).

Everything was perfect.  Everyone's meal was delicious and Stephanie provided great service.  The bacon bits appetizer was quite a treat.  The restaurant provided a special \"Congrats\" dessert for our granddaughter, which made her feel very special. They offer their meals in a regular size or a larger size for sharing.

On the hunt for good fried chicken, my friend and I both ordered the same thing, except she ordered all white meat and I ordered dark meat. Mine was dried and super crusty. It was over fired that I asked the nice waitress if they were freshly made or re-fried? She assured me that it was freshly made but I am a good cook, I know what a re-fried meat looks like. I took the leftover home and peel the crust off to see how much chicken was actually underneath all that crust. Turned out, the meat is cut very thin, 1/2\" or even less. Perhaps for fast cooking but the batter was coated so thick to increase the thickness of chicken, it made it horrible because it's all over-fried crust and very thin and little meat. Even if the chicken was organic or whatever, it's pointless by the time it's done. I wish I have taken a photo to show you the cut open chicken on my plate. It was so dark and ugly, I didn't bother. \n\nWith all that being said about one dish, I have to say this place is great for bar food and happy hour. Excellent appetizers and drinks. It's one of favorite gather places in San Mateo. I only wish it's isn't so noisy when the place is full of people. I'll still go back there but just not for fried chicken.
