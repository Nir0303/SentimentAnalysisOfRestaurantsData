The chicken dinner I ordered was perfectly cooked- literally the best chicken I have ever had in an Indian restaurant. Shareable portions and a colorful atmosphere made this meal complete and I would definitely return if in the area again. Thank you livingsocial for pointing us in this direction! Just a note: the parking is rather sparse and paid with quarter meters for the most part.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-11-20T17:41:00-0500", "location_id": "1391523", "id": "240776406", "user": {"username": "Sing4Elohim", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Variable food, but great service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41353-d1391523-r240364024-m11068-Spice_Xing-Rockville_Maryland.html#review240364024", "text": "We went to dinner at Spice Xing in November 2014. We were pleasantly greeted by the maitre d' and led to our table. The restaurant is large, has an open feeling, and is well decorated.\n\nOur food was variable in quality. My daughter's uthappam appetizer and chicken tikka appetizer were both excellent. My malai kofta with garlic naan was also delicious. So far so good. But my wife's shrimp entree was pretty mediocre. She said it was either not fresh or overcooked. She barely ate anyway.\n\nTo the credit of the wait staff, they noticed and asked if everything was ok. My wife very rarely complains about food in restaurants, but this time around, she did say something. The restaurant offered to get her another portion which she declined. They did end up taking her entree off the bill which was very nice of them.\n\nI'd have given this restaurant a 4-star rating had it not been for the shrimp.\n\nWe'll probably go back, just wouldn't order the shrimp next time.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-11-18T03:20:48-0500", "location_id": "1391523", "id": "240364024", "user": {"username": "VSSUBR", "user_location": {"name": "Potomac, Maryland", "id": "41328"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "Great experience.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41353-d1391523-r237830992-m11068-Spice_Xing-Rockville_Maryland.html#review237830992", "text": "As an Indian I tend not to go to Indian restaurants too often. Frankly, I find them sub-par as the owners just do not bring a world-class atmosphere and finesse to eateries. It is just like as if we never left our country.\n\nEven, if they are of class they tend to cut corners, or charge patrons stupidly high prices for small portions.\n\nSpice Xing, I feel, maybe has bucked that trend.
