To start off the music is WAY TO LOUD, (guess Im getting to old;) ) And who goes to a restaurant to listen to HEAVY METAL?  I understand they have a bar but it is a restaurant, and 6:00 pm on a weekday is not exactly rock out party time.  The patrons of the restaurant, during my visit, were two families with children between five and 12, a few couples, an older couple with, what I would think would be their grandchildren and a small group of younger gentleman enjoying a beer and burgers.  The bar patrons ranged from middle age men and women to a couple of older gentlemen.  In no way did this crowd seem rialed up for LOUD HEAVY METAL.  The music was only being enjoyed by the bar staff it seemed.  There are TV's at every table which is great, but with the LOUD HEAVY METAL could not be enjoyed.  Our server was friendly enough but not very attentative.  We ordered Burgers and fries, the specialty of the place and were very dissapointed. Not only were they not prepared as asked (seems to be a difficult task by cooks everywhere these days, preparing a burger to order rather than however it comes out) My medium burger was draining blood into a pool under my fries (yummy... for a vampire, gross to me). Once that was taken back and properly, almost anyway, cooked it just did not taste right. Not sure what kind of seasoning they put into their meat but it s not enjoyable.  My counterparts burger had the same taste so it wasnt a one off, Speaking of one off, this place is definatly ONE OFF my list of places to visit!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-20T11:14:10-0400", "location_id": "4456351", "id": "290813697", "user": {"username": "Richard D", "user_location": {"name": "Central Valley, New York", "id": "47441"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Good pub fare food.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30029-d4456351-r258473302-m11068-Roosevelt_s_21st-Allentown_Pennsylvania.html#review258473302", "text": "Friendly staff, good pub food.
