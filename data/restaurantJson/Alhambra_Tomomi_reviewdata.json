It has a very extensive menu of sushi, sashimi, Japanese noodles and other dishes.  The restaurant is very large and is set up in a traditional village decor.  The service is good and the food is very fresh.  The salad and soup come in large servings as do the main courses.   Parking is available on the street and in the nearby City parking structure around the corner on First Street, north of Main Street.  Good to try and enjoy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-10T20:39:21-0400", "location_id": "10522879", "id": "391211830", "user": {"username": "geotech522", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Surprisingly good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29078-d10522879-r389912038-m11068-Tomomi-Alhambra_California.html#review389912038", "text": "Good food with quality and quantity.
