I don't live far from here and decided to do some wine tasting. First of all, the lady that was working there did not acknowledge me there. I said hi and stood by the counter to ask for a tasting. She looked at me briefly and continued to talk to another lady that clearly was not even there for a tasting. She ignored me for 20 min. Finished her conversation then looked at me as if she was bothered that she had to work. I asked for a tasting and it seemed to put her out. She was short, not friendly and it made me feel uncomfortable. Poor atmosphere and company. I do not recommend this place at all. The people that work here are rude and seem to not like their job. It's not a real wine tasting. It's store bought wine.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-25T22:31:38-0400", "location_id": "5846679", "id": "397163154", "user": {"username": "Froggyteeth", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "intimate little place run by great people", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32147-d5846679-r386677999-m11068-The_Wine_Closet-Camarillo_California.html#review386677999", "text": "So this is a wine bar basically with some great snacking options. Great cheeses and different plates. I have been in probably 6 times now and never had a bad experience. It is located in the artsy \"Old Town Camarillo\" area and I think this place adds to the experience. Reasonable tastings and really the place is friendly probably because the owners are and love what they do.
