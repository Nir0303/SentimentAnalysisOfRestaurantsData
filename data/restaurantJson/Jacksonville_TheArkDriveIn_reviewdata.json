It is a small restaurant built in the shape of a ship. It is a local favorite for giving you great food at cheap prices. Nothing is made until you drive up. The menu is based on fried chicken and seafood. Both are very good and are done old style. Your dinner is placed on a cardboard tray and covered with French fries. And a cup of Cole slaw. Did I mention that every plate also gets Hush Puppies! These are awesome. If you not run off by an old basic walk up style eatery and you have to either eat in the car or take your food home this place is for you.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-16T10:19:03-0400", "location_id": "8641251", "id": "311025249", "user": {"username": "TexanXXL", "user_location": {"name": "Jacksonville NC", "id": null}}}]}
