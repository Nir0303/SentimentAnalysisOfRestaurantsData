My daughter and I stopped in around 11:30 and before we left around noon the place was packed. Several people appeared to be local and stop here often. Kind of like Cheers, they knew their names. I had the naughty dog which has melted cheese, bacon bits and tomatoes, oh so tasty. My daughter had regular hot dogs with ketchup, mustard and chili sauce. She said the sauce was great! She got fries and it was a large order, very good. The place is a little building, four tables and a small counter. Decor was fun. Staff consisted of three women who seemed to know their stuff. If there was ever a place to try a different hot dog, this is the place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-05-04T16:30:52-0400", "location_id": "5007558", "id": "270042313", "user": {"username": "cad33049", "user_location": {"name": "Kokomo, Indiana", "id": "37234"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Change your name!!!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60913-d5007558-r240085755-m11068-Naughty_Dawgs_Express-New_Bedford_Massachusetts.html#review240085755", "text": "Stopped got a couple of dogs they were the worst dogs ive ever had.
