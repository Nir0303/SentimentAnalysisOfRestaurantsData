My favorite is the eggplant lunch with veggies.  A word of caution, go lower on the spice scale than you think you should.  I love spicy, Indian food, and a spice level of 2 is just perfect for me.  If you don't like spicy food at all- definitely stick with a 1.  My only complaint is that the service can be slow, so just make sure that you don't have a meeting scheduled for after lunch!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-10-26T09:06:51-0400", "location_id": "782605", "id": "321996423", "user": {"username": "organicchemist", "user_location": {"name": "Des Moines", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Great food all the time!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37835-d782605-r301521772-m11068-Thai_Flavors-Des_Moines_Iowa.html#review301521772", "text": "Every time I go there it's great food and great service whether it's take out or to eat in.
