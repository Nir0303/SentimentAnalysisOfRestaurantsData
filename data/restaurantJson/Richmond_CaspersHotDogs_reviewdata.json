I was a student at Ells Jr. High School and had my first Casper's hot dog. 65 years later I went out of my way to have another since I now live in WA State. Over the years when living in CA and teaching near by in Richmond, I ate hundreds of these delicious delicacies. They were known for their \"crunch\" when bitten and the large fresh tomato wedges and fresh slices of onions (later on you could get warm kraut). It had been almost 25 years since I had one. Well, it was worth the wait! Nice to see that the dogs I remembered had not been compromised. Same wonderful taste, same crunch on being bitten. Caspers was surgical room like clean. The counter attendants were friendly and efficient. One can rarely relive a great experience, especially after 25 years. This was such a treat. I plan to come back in far fewer years. If anyone is in Richmond, CA and you want to see what  great hot dog tastes like, go down Macdonald Ave, across from the City Center, and have a couple of Casper Dogs. The regular are 80% beef and 20% pork. They also offer 100% beef dogs.
