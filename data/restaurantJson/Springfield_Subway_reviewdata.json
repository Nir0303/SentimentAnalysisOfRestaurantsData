You get what you expect at just about any subway. However there were only three people ahead of me at 12:45pm and I did not leave with my six inch sandwich for 18 minutes!! The staff was overwhelmed by the drive up window and the whole time I was there they kept switching places, reaching over and across one another and in general looking very unorganized. They reminded me of a sports team thrown together at the last minute without ever having practiced. I could have went to the next Subway down the street and done better time wise.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-09-10T10:11:32-0400", "location_id": "4194478", "id": "228137318", "user": {"username": "kentdan1", "user_location": {"name": "Springfield Illinois", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "5 Dollars", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60887-d4194478-r212189184-m11068-Subway-Springfield_Illinois.html#review212189184", "text": "Who doesn't like a 5 dollar foot long, made quick, never an extended line, and always a decent temperature.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-06-26T08:12:28-0400", "location_id": "4194478", "id": "212189184", "user": {"username": "Ceresia B", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
