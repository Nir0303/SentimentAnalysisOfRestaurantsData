One of us had been before and highly recommended the Spicy Seafood (15.95) but most of us decided on the lunch special (7.99). When I read the description of a seafood medley stir fried with peppers, onions, basil and bamboo shoots, I was sold! Even though priced at almost twice the \"special\" it was worth every penny. Mussels fresh and plump, cooked just right. The shrimp, calimari and fish fillet were perfect in the spicy (not too spicy, thank you) flavorful sauce!\nThe pork spare ribs were flavorful and not over sauced, tender but not mushy. The orange chicken, pork pad thai and chicken pepper and garlic, all got the nod and the vegetable soup and egg roll added to the value of the lunch special.\nThe food and service left us satisfied and feeling that the tim had passed way too quickly!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-28T15:39:03-0400", "location_id": "5045533", "id": "432526403", "user": {"username": "craig g", "user_location": {"name": "Riverside, California", "id": "32978"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Fresh Thai Flavors", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32978-d5045533-r269822931-m11068-Angel_Thai_Cuisine-Riverside_California.html#review269822931", "text": "Angel Thai may not have the most curb appeal but walk inside and you will be treated to one of the Inland Empires better Thai finds.\n\nThe decor inside is comfortable and mirrored walls create the illusion of space.\n\nYou immediately smell the garlic, basil and soy from the kitchen.\n\nThe staff is friendly and food arrives promptly but this is family speed not chain restaurant speed. Generally there is only one or two servers and they share hostess, phone order and cashier duties. \n\nAngel Thai does a very robust take out business. The phone is always ringing and patrons pull up to the curb on Brockton to run inside to pick up their to go orders.\n\nThe food is quite good. Nice selection of the standards with a few extras like duck or whole fried tilapia. Plenty of curries and very vegetarian friendly. Something for everyone.\n\nThe spicy fried basil rice is very fragrant with just the right amount of heat. I recommend choosing shrimp as the\ne protein here.\n\nGlass noodle aka Pad Woon Sen are also quite nice with an array of vegetables added in. Chicken makes a nice addition.\n\nThe appetizer plate for four makes a nice opener with plenty of fried goodies such as shrimp and Thai rolls for everyone to try.\n\nThe Thai Iced Tea is pulled off nicely witha creamy almost velvet like texture.\n\nParking is easier in the back lot and there is a rear entrance.\n\nVisa and Mastercard are welcome and they are open on Sundays.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-05-03T20:19:59-0400", "location_id": "5045533", "id": "269822931", "user": {"username": "IEOCRealReviews", "user_location": {"name": "Southern CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Good value, good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32978-d5045533-r242527472-m11068-Angel_Thai_Cuisine-Riverside_California.html#review242527472", "text": "We love to pop in and out of Angel Thai when time is important.

Now here comes the best part...the dish came with shrimp, clams, crab meat and fish..soon as I ate it, my stomach started rumbling....had to run to the John..... had a bad case of diaherria.....which means  the meat had gone bad.
