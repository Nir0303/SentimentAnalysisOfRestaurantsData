I had a great martini made from a local gin, some of the best food and most creative dishes I've eaten anywhere and a wonderful wine flight with some very good wines. The entire back of the menu were dishes made with items grown in their newly certified organic garden. A true farm to table experience. There were also numerous meat, poultry and fish choices that also looked quite creative. This was a real find.  The staff was friendly and the service prompt.
