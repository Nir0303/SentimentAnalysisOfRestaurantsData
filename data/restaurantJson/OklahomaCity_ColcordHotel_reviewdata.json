The arrangements I had made by phone were not done nor would they be, the hotel was quite chaotic because of construction.  I called \"my\" hotel (COLCORD) and they made every need I had happen instantly, including early check in to leave a gift in the room.  Robes are furnished (had to request at the other) and I added his name to the room so he had ability to sign for dinner, etc.  I am sorry to say, the other hotel was not helpful with that arrangement.  Shaneca assured me she would make their visit as easy for them as possible.  The extra bonus?? Saved $100 on the room.  The other room was $250.  For none of my requests.
