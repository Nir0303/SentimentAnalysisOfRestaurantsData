We were planning a dinner party and thought we should try Rubino's before attempting service for 10.  We came for lunch and ordered from the dinner menu to try some of the items. We started with the soup, and the minestrone soup consisted of fresh vegetable, beans, and small amount of pasta items. It was great. The salad had a great light vinaigrette that was just the right amount for the amount of lettuce and other items. Next we ordered 1 serving of veal picatta with garlic mash potatoes, and glazed carrots. The veal came with two perfectly sized pieces of thinly sliced veal that was very lightly breaded, with a sauce that exceeded our expectations. Great combination of what seemed to be butter, white wine, lemon juice and capers and plenty of it.  The mashed potatoes, just as expected, subtle hint of garlic and tasty creamy mash of potato. The glazed carrots, tasted as though they came right from the garden, large and sweet along with a sweet butter sauce that worked well with the rest of the items. The other serving was of the chicken picatta with risotto and glazed carrots.  It seemed as though it was a split chicken breast, breaded lightly, and served with the same great sauce as on the veal. The risotto was prepared just as we like it, dry with just enough moistness to hold it together in its \"cupped\" form.  The desserts, limoncello cake and tiramisu were the hit of our meal. We really enjoyed this meal so much, we ordered from the to go menu and served 10 with chicken picatta,  garlic mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and a smaller portion of a mix of the limoncello cakes and tiramisu.

Each time we have visited, service was extremely slow and not worth the wait based on food quality.  Our first two visits, we just figured it was a busy night or some extra large party overwhelmed the kitchen. I think the servers are overwhelmed, I think they have intentions to deliver good service but they can't do that without adequate support of the restaurant management. \nOur past experiences included :  waiting  15 + minutes before someone acknowledges you to take your order.  Appetizers come with your dinner or your side doesn't come with your dinner.  Really?  Wouldn't the server know that as they bring you your dinner plate- that visit the server had to ask someone.  \n\nThe food is okay but it's not worth dealing  with all the poor restaurant management problems. It's too bad because i was really hoping to find a great neighborhood Italian restaurant to visit.

First impression was the decor needed to be lightened and updated, it seemed \"oldish\" and quite dark; I guess good for romance though. However, the primarily problem was the food was just food. In other words, middle of the road, not bad, but nothing to write home about, especially for the price. The chef just didn't develop great flavors. The meats (steaks) and pastas lacked that wake up your taste buds quality. We assume the spices used just didn't hit the mark. Service was good and attentive, Anyway, as Emeril would say they need to kick it up a notch to get the wow factor. By the way, dessert was excellent, great presentation and taste!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-31T17:31:12-0400", "location_id": "2724222", "id": "294551769", "user": {"username": "LoomisSteve", "user_location": {"name": "Loomis, California", "id": "32650"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Poor Excuse for Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32980-d2724222-r287451077-m11068-Rubino_s_Ristorante-Rocklin_California.html#review287451077", "text": "My friend and I ate dinner here on July 3rd 2015. The atmosphere is adequate. The food is cafeteria style at best. My friend had the sole which was suppose to be fresh but had a very odd taste. I had the meat cannelloni and it had absolutely no taste. The carrots were served sliced in a ceramic bowl and tasted awful. Actually the only good part of the meal was the bread and the brockley. The waitress was nice but the food is just not worth the money and I will not be going back to this restaurant.
