I honestly wish they had a location where I live because the menu option is large and very reasonably priced. The food always taste great no matter if it's the steak and eggs breakfast or the sourdough bacon cheeseburger to the chili cheese fries. What I love is how there are many Mexican food selections on the menu along side American food. The best of both worlds! The staff are always friendly. I usually get my food to go but there is plenty seating for dining in. They also allow phone orders. I eat here every visit to LA - Norwalk.
