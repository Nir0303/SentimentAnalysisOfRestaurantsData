Authentic Mexican that you would expect to get in Southern California is right here in Hampton Roads.  Restaurant decor reminds me of the West coast,  as does the music; all that's missing is the Pacific Ocean. \n\nService was good.  This was our third visit and each time we were happy with the service. One thing I believe others reviewers are citing is that this is not a place where you order and 5 minutes later your food arrives.  It takes time to cook each plate to order versus staging food for hours before it's ordered.  In other words,  most Mexican restaurants around here are very fast to bring out the food.  Though they have good quality food as well,  what Jose is turning out is special.  \n\nThe flavors that are present in each dish are carefully thought out.  I love how fresh the food is and how well Jose is able to incorporate ingredients such as cilantro,  onions tomato, jalape\u00f1o, Sriracha, etc. into his dishes.  They are unique and bursting with flavor.  Another thing that I appreciate is that the food isn't salty or over spiced.  I like that each element is able to stand on its own,  yet together compliment each other so well.  That to me is more of the authentic Mexican flavors than what we are accustomed to here on the east coast.  Each bite is better than the last. \n\nIf you have the chance to meet Jose while you are there,  you will note that he has passion in his eyes.  He cares about the food that he serves and he wants to make sure each and every person in your party is satisfied.  So glad that this small business has persevered for 2+ years and I am glad to say that they are getting better each time we visit.  If you are in the area and looking for great food, or looking for a great spot to take your significant other,  I highly recommend East Coast Taco.

It's usually a good sign when anything (that's not a chain) can survive a couple years in Suffolk.  We love to see non-chains in the area, but overall we were pretty disappointed.\n\nFirst, the restaurant itself is nice.  I really liked the atmosphere and the d\u00e9cor.  It's just comfortable.  There are a few booths in the bar area and a raised table area in front of the window.  There are several tables in the main dining area.  It's not huge, so if it's busy, there might be a wait. I saw something on a Google review that called this a 'hole in the wall' and that is not correct.  \n\nThe night we went, it was mostly empty.  The booths in the bar area were taken and we couldn't do the table by the window with a high chair.  There were two couples in the dining room, but they were finishing when we arrived.  We sat in the dining area, \n\nThe service was good until the end of the meal.  They were very attentive.  They were great with my toddler.  They even rushed her food because she was a bit fussy.  I really appreciated that,\n\nI ordered a sangria.  It was a bit light. It's good if you want a slight taste of a sangria, but not the heaviness of the wine or alcohol.  This was more like a light punch (or watered-down sangria) with very little alcohol.\n\nThey serve chips and salsa and white dipping sauce upon seating.  The salsa was kind of bland and mild. The white dip had a little kick.  I'm not a fan of the white sauce, though.  I'm not aware that it's authentic, but it's popped up in every Mexican restaurant I have eaten at in the below the Mason-Dixon in the past umpteen years (I first had it in SC back in 2001).  I've still not seen it in the restaurants I go to up in the north yet.  Maybe it's crept up there, I'm not sure, but I wish it would go away.  Every place I've eaten where this is served, the salsa tends to be bland (as if you'll forgive the bad salsa by eating the white sauce, but I prefer good salsa).  \n\nWe ordered a chicken quesadilla for my daughter, my husband got the enchilada supreme and I got two carne asada (grilled steak) and two pollo (chicken) tacos.  I asked about cheese on the quesadilla and they said, yes, it has cheese. \n\nWhen the food came, I was surprised.  My husband's order was okay (for $9.75 it was just four small enchiladas with no sides, but he liked the sauce).  My daughter's quesadilla hardly had any cheese.  It was small and mostly dried-out shredded chicken (for $6).  I tasted it and it was slightly seasoned.  She ate a couple of bites and was done with it.  My meal was the most disappointing.  For $9.75, I got four small, soft taco shells with a little bit of meat and a few pieces of onion thrown on top (I asked for them to hold the cilantro).  I was surprised at the dish- and even more surprised when I tried it.  The steak was very tough, dry, fatty, and had no taste.  The chicken was also dry and had no taste. I took a small bite of one steak and one chicken taco and was done.  I thought for that price (with no sides, no sauce, nothing else), it would be delicious and flavorful, but it was neither.  No, I didn't want some heavily-sauced or over-seasoned meat, but it should have had something...anything...to justify the price or us going back. I should mention I asked for a box for my food and I only put the meat in there and I felt bad wasting a box.  I could have wrapped the meat up in a napkin, there was so little of it.\n\nI had to order lettuce, tomato, and sour cream on the side.  I got a miniscule ration of wet head lettuce, a few chopped tomatoes and sour cream in a butter cup (the same size you'd get for clarified butter for a lobster).  No joke- they charged me $1.00 for the lettuce, $1.00 for the tomato, and $1.50 for the sour cream.  I ordered some refried beans- I got a small amount in a saucer-sized plate and that was $2.95 (and that was bland and completely dried-out, so much so I had trouble digging it out on a chip).  That's absolutely ridiculous.  For almost $10, I think you can throw in some of that for free- and if not, those tacos should have been able to stand on their own regarding quality, but they didn't.  \n\nI doubt we'll return, which is a shame because I do prefer non-chain restaurants and support local places in our area, but I can't justify the cost vs the quality of food.  I felt nickeled and dimed, too, on heavily over-priced 'sides'.\n\nThe upside, as I mentioned, was the service was good.  I will say, though, we were left alone a bit too long at the end even though they weren't busy.  We waited 20 minutes after we got the check before the server came back to take our payment (and when the waitress gave us the check, we told her we had to go, but she disappeared).  Other than that, though, the service was good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-18T17:10:50-0500", "location_id": "6580327", "id": "349014312", "user": {"username": "jmccullough33", "user_location": {"name": "Suffolk, Virginia", "id": "58224"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Fantastic Service & Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58224-d6580327-r325606444-m11068-East_Coast_Taco-Suffolk_Virginia.html#review325606444", "text": "This was my first visit, and if it were closer to home, I would definitely be returning.

We decided to try this place tonight based on what we had heard from others.  We were quickly seated without a wait at approximately 8PM on a Friday night.  There were no available booths, but there were about 4 other tables open.  Our waiter was very good and attentive.  The food was subpar and I can assure you there are authentic Mexican restaurants close by that beat this food hands down.  The chips were made of corn flour that was either not cooked appropriately or had other issues.  I kept getting tiny pieces that were very hard and I thought I had chipped a tooth at one point.  This was not a very pleasant experience.  There were some really good reviews last summer.  I wish we had tried it then.

My husband treated me to take out tonight and I ordered a taco salad. I've never had a soggy taco salad with a 'stale-like' shell. When I asked for the manager, the first lady told me that she was the manager. When I told her about my salad, she put someone on the phone. When I questioned who she was, she responds 'we have different managers'. After explaining to her that I could have gone to taco bell for a better cheaper salad, she states that the next time I come in, she would give me another one. I responded again with my dissatisfaction, and asked for a replacement item and she tells me no. By, this time I'm really pissed and sent my hubby back up there. We will NEVER go there again. Anyone who doesn't care about my food, doesn't deserve my business! I will say this: my husband was given another one but to be honest, I was scared to eat it for fear of what was done to it due to do-over.
