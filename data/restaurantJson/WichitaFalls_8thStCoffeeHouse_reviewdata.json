They treat you like family. I usually call my order in ahead due to I have a very tight schedule at work. The last time I ordered lunch I again called ahead, when I received my usual order of a BLT and strawberry-banana smoothly with milk- I noticed on my smoothie lid there was a note which read, \"Have awesome day Marnie.\" It was nice to receive the nice words which brightened my day. Another time when I made the call ahead, when I arrived there was a long line; I had an employee call to me from the back of the line asking me to come to the front of the line stating my order was waiting- they let me come to the front of the line to pay so my food would not get cold. They have awesome fresh smoothies which are the best in town. And their fresh sandwiches are awesome. If you are looking for a comfortable place to have a quick lunch- this is the place for you. I believe they are also open for breakfast . This place reminds me of the coffee shop on the television series \"Friends.\"  They have a good selection of board games to hang out with friends/co-workers- you just have to ask for them. I believe they have an open mic night once per week. The only downfall to this place is they close too early. They are only open one night per week past 4:00 pm. They had late hours on the weekend, but have changed to one night per week. They have a great selection of fresh sandwiches, fresh smoothies and coffees. I encourage everyone to try this place at least once- you will come back often. Thank you 8th Street Coffee House!!! You are the best lunch place with all fresh food- if you give them a try-you will be a customer for life, as I am.

The lunch combos are great - sandwich and soup or salad. Price is reasonable and food is good. It is hard to find a table because the place is well liked and nice to relax with lunch and conversation.\nI was with a group of friends, each of us got a combo - none of them the same but everyone enjoyed. The meals also came with a Hershey's Kiss - a nice touch.\n\nThe iced tea was so good and the weekly drink special the Hazelnut Sl*t was a must.\n\nThe cafe is in an old building in downtown Wichita falls with lots of history.\n\nIf you are in town and want a fun experience this is the place to visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-04T11:02:05-0400", "location_id": "4887160", "id": "277895399", "user": {"username": "DallasTravels107", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas", "id": "55711"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Best Place in Town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56891-d4887160-r277078707-m11068-8th_St_Coffee_House-Wichita_Falls_Texas.html#review277078707", "text": "This is the best place in town to stop in for lunch.
