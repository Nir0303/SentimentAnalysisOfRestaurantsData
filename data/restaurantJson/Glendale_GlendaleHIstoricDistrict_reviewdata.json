However, it is never so during the season between Thanksgiving and New Year's when a drive through the Glendale Historic District and Caitlin Court. We never miss it...It's beyond wondrous to drive down Glendale Ave., east of 59th Ave and see the million dollars worth of Christmas lights. Year by year we see additions to the display and it becomes more and more spectacular with all the palm tree trunks covered with lights of all colors, flashing lights, running lights, you can hardly take it all in...This in the park area. There are various forms of entertainment in this park, in the bandshell are kids tapdancing, bands playing, someone giving announcements, Plan to spend some time there. Try to leave time to take a slow drive up and down each north/south street north of Glendale Ave. You will see horse and carriage rides you can ride for a fee snuggled under blankets as it usually gets quite cold at that time of year, late at night. It's not Central Park, but it's nearby where we live. The streets off Glendale are lined with palm trees, all dressed with beautiful outlining lights, the organization of them is breathtaking. There are many restaurants, fancy and casual where you can have fine dining down to a piece of fudge in a cart in the park some weekends. I won't try to name the restaurants, except the one we make reservations for weekend dining and that is The Spicery on the corner of 59th Ave and Palmaire. Beautiful, good food in a home over 100 yrs. old. Some nights you can even soar in a hot air balloon, well not very high but you can experience being inside the basket of an actual, for real one. A highlight for our family every year is to have pictures taken in front of the huge and always different but always incredible Christmas tree. It is beside the Municipal building and no parking, or even driving by so you have to be creative in finding a place to park then walk to it, but it's worth the sight.
