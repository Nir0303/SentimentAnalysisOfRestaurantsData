Our waiter Andrew was super profession and informed. He kept a good eye on us and let us a try a few of the beers on tap before we made a selection. He also recommended the twisty potatoes which was a win with both of us. \n\nThe only thing on the menu here are burgers and fries. That is it. Don't go expecting to get anything else! But, they do have a good, interesting selection of burgers. Both of us don't eat beef/pork, but they advised that they had a veggie (black bean/wild rice) burger that could be subbed for any regular burger patty. We were both happy about that. I chose a mushroom, swiss, teriyaki burger. My spouse chose a burger with a fried egg and cheese on it. They also have fresh cut potato fries in 2 forms: regular cut and spiral cut. My spouse got the regular and I got the curls. Hands down the curls are the winner in both taste and texture. We were both happy with our burgers. The veggies patties do have a little bit of a kick to them, but I am a spice baby. So, a regular-level spice tolerant person may not even notice. They had good flavor. \n\nThe menu is pretty cheap, but they charge the fries and burgers separately, so it looks slightly cheaper than it is. Still, you get a good burger and delicious fresh cut fries for under $10. \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-06-14T16:34:57-0400", "location_id": "10133976", "id": "382612402", "user": {"username": "FoderickE", "user_location": {"name": "Minnesota", "id": "28944"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great food good beer choices", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43493-d10133976-r381251615-m11068-JL_Beers-Saint_Cloud_Minnesota.html#review381251615", "text": "The place is a typical tap bar with burgers.
