From statues of the Blues Brothers in the outside courtyard to the huge screaming head in the bar, it is quite unique.  Lots of interesting wood and trim make the d\u00e9cor very interesting.  The menu tends to burgers and fajitas and things like that.  We had chicken wings, fajitas, fried calamari and a burger and everyone was impressed by the fare.

If you got just 30 minutes, you will not be done in time.\nIts a good location, with a good atmosphere - but the management needs to figure out how to hire and or train.
