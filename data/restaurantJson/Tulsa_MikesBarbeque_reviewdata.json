On my first visit I asked for whatever was good. The nice lady said, \"we just pulled some ribs off. They're very meaty and have no sauce on them.\" \"No sauce?\" I asked. \"No,\" she said. \"We don't like to hide anything.\" It is true the baby back ribs are amazing. The chopped brisket may be the very best in Tulsa, that's right.... BEST. \n\nOne of my goto meals at Mike's is the pulled pork sandwich piled high with cole slaw. Just look at my pictures to see, but visit his truck to understand. See the bark? You will not find that type of BBQ love at most joints. Also, a very important note, you will not find many BBQ joints that serve only meat from off the smoker that day. Yeah, so, not day old meat. \n\nBe sure you follow Mike's BBQ on Facebook. He normally parks his truck at 91st and Delaware, I have many friends that drive across town just to get their hands on some. \n\nLastly, I have ordered for large groups before, well worth it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-12-08T12:44:41-0500", "location_id": "8544711", "id": "331499464", "user": {"username": "Brian M", "user_location": {"name": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "id": "51697"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Best BBQ in Tulsa...Heck, Best BBQ in Oklahoma", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d8544711-r326939670-m11068-Mike_s_Barbeque-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review326939670", "text": "First off....this is a food truck, not a physical restaurant. Mike and his crew are typically located at the corner of 91st and Delaware when they aren't working events around the state/region. \n\nFood: good gracious, tender is the word. The ribs, fall off the bone. The pulled pork, juicy. The chopped brisket, jucier. Stuffed baked potatoes, you'll need a stack of paper towels. \n\nIt's evident that Mike takes great pride in what he puts out there. He's Kansas City BBQ Society certified.

Happen to run across Mike's bbq food truck told him what we were looking for and he let us sample some chopped brisket. Delicious!!  He doesn't use barbeque sauce to hide food but he does offer it on the side. We purchased some more brisket & ribs and asked for his business card and over the next month brought food again. You know you can get something once or twice and product could change, but this wasn't the case. Mike's food is consistently delicious!  3 years later we only eat barbeque from him unless my hubby barbeques for our family.  You will not be disappointed in anyway!!  ; )  Fyi he also does catering and offers yummy sides & desserts.
