But KFC has been stepping up lately. I've read reviews that have rated KFC's chicken sandwich as most delicious even over places like Chic-Filet (sic). KFC has always felt a little different than places like Mickey D's and Burger King. What I allow myself now and again is their chicken pot pies. They have a Monday special on them and they're a tremendous deal. The crusts are crispy and delicious and the filling is full of great \"stuff\", including lots of chunks of delicious chicken. I love me a good chicken pot pie. It's one of the best \"comfort foods\" ever invented. A lot of the frozen chicken pot pies, even from well-known names, are soupy and don't have a lot of \"stuff\" in there. Which doesn't make any sense because it's just vegetables and chicken, not super duper expensive ingredients. But I guess that's just companies trying to make a profit and not thinking about their customers. Not The Colonel. KFC fills their chicken pot pies to the brim and there is no disappointment there. Of course, since you're there you usually end up getting some of their delicious cole slaw and mashed potatoes and gravy which, again, are consistently good. \n\nI usually have my friend do the pick-up run at this location for me and we eat at home. She says the restaurant is clean and the employees are super friendly. What's kinda funny is that sometimes she gets back home and there's sometimes something extra in the bag like an order of fries or something. Nothing has even been left out of our order that I can remember so I guess if they err in your favor it's ok, right? But it's always good procedure to check our take-out order before you leave anywhere. The KFC commercials are pretty funny lately with the various fake celebrity Colonels taking their turns. What is staying consistent is the quality and value of this fast food. Keep doing it right, Colonel!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-09-04T10:25:36-0400", "location_id": "4826945", "id": "414637860", "user": {"username": "David R", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Clair Shores, Michigan", "id": "42669"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Always excellent - every time - worth the drive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42669-d4826945-r409520273-m11068-KFC-Saint_Clair_Shores_Michigan.html#review409520273", "text": "This particular KFC puts all others in this area (the east side of Detroit) to shame.
