The salad was simple and fresh (lettuce, spinach and onions), the mini pizza was made to order and took about 5 minutes.  The food was good and hit the spot.  This is a small mom and pop type operation that apparently has three shops in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-11-09T15:22:54-0500", "location_id": "11807395", "id": "435994398", "user": {"username": "dwm_SGF_1987", "user_location": {"name": "Springfield, MO", "id": null}}}]}
