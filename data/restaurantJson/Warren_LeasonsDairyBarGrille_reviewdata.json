My wife and I are to the point where we get excited each spring when they open for the new season (they typically close down each December through mid-February).  We always get ourselves a Glacier for dessert, because they beat - hands-down - the best Blizzard that DQ has ever made.  The ice cream they use tastes great, the kids who work the counters are ALWAYS pleasant and smiling (be sure to tip them!), and in the summer, when the lines can run out the door, they still get people served quickly and efficiently.  There's a \"frequent buyer\" card you can get which gets you $5 off your order after you fill it up.
