This was a regular shopping area in the 60s, complete with a JC Penny and various merchants that supplied shoes, lock servicing, camera supplies, a couple drug stores, etc. All of those shops are long gone, except for Watson's Drugstore, recently converted to a fountain and cafe, and the Army-Navy Store, which has been in business since the mid-50s. The other shops were replaced with antique malls, and now some of those have been replaced with restaurants and specialty shops. I still love to visit the park at the center of the traffic circle and have been so happy to see that others feel the same. In fact I go out of my way to travel through it regularly when I out for a run. It's a nice place to take out of town visitors to just browse the shops and have something delicious to eat.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-24T11:37:47-0400", "location_id": "8036315", "id": "410191940", "user": {"username": "DebbieDoo", "user_location": {"name": "Orange, California", "id": "32825"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "A must for those looking for antiques", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32825-d8036315-r348555053-m11068-Plaza_Square_Park-Orange_California.html#review348555053", "text": "We live not far from here and walk into town at least once a month.
