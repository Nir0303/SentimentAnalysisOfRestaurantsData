Not a special occasion restaurant unless your special occasion is enjoying delicious Korean barbecue. My wife and I usually each order a Bento box, which includes various food components. I like the shrimp tempura while my wife likes the melt-in-your-mouth shredded beef teriyaki. Service is prompt and polite. Arrayed along one wall, there are also five tables which have built-in propane barbecue grills. These tables are designed for groups of 4, 5 or 6 people who are ordering a variety of dishes that could be cooked on the grill. \"Traveling the world one meal at a time...\"", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-04-25T19:26:16-0400", "location_id": "878939", "id": "158813977", "user": {"username": "DSteveCA", "user_location": {"name": "Folsom, California", "id": "32389"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-03", "title": "Fast and Tasty", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32283-d878939-r125718777-m11068-Manna_Korean_Restaurant-Davis_California.html#review125718777", "text": "Hungry for a late delectable lunch and if you like raw fish?
