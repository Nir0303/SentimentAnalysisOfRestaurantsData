I've had an enjoyed most of their menu items, especially the chicken salad and spinach wrap with chicken. Their loaded baked potato soup is delicious.\n\nI learned quickly which of their sweets to stay away from, and which to consistently order. Their truffles aren't a real truffle, more of a cake ball, but usually tasty. The brownies and blondies were a solid option.

I'd like to know more about what you got & that may help me understand what it was served on.  If you were unhappy with anything, I wish you would have told someone while you were there so we could at least try to rectify the situation. Feedback (good or bad) can be very helpful to let us know we need to change something or that we are getting something right. I would love to talk with you further if you are willing to help make us better. We can't fix what we don't know needs to be different. My personal goal is to create a pleasurable dining experience with good food & service. I'm sorry we didn't provide that for you.

Not too many American places can make my wife\u2019s eyebrows raise when enjoying a plain Latte, but Delectable Edibles Caf\u00e9 did!  If you are looking for a European quality coffee, this is it.\n\nSo a month later, while at another Foster Fest, I stopped in for a light meal with my wife and son.  I got the chicken salad on a crescent, my son got a cup of soup, and we indulged with a few homemade sweets.  Honestly, my wife fell in love immediately.  The food is fantastic, and tastes very fresh.  The atmosphere is refreshing and very\u2026mix between old school American caf\u00e9 and European feel.  The place is very warm and inviting.  When visiting, you can sit and enjoy the company you are with for an hour or two over great food, treats and coffee.  \n\nSo, a day or two later, my wife had lunch with a friend at Delectable Edibles Caf\u00e9 to try their noon fair.  They both loved it.  The family atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting.  There is no rushing, loud music, televisions blaring, or pressure to turn your table.  Relax, chill and enjoy your time seems to be the unwritten theme to customers.\n\nSo, if you have a desire for fresh made food, sweet treats, or the best Latte in town, you need to check this place out.
