The cook was very nice, however as i was waiting on my food i notice at least 100 flies flying around the kitchen area. The cook placed my food on the counter and immediately flies were swarming around it. I fanned them away and suggested that he should buy some fly paper to deal the problem. He told me thanks and said someone else told him to do the same. AND to make a bad situation worse when i got to my car i opened my sack and took a bite out of the shrimp and noticed instantly that they were spoiled and had a foul odor to them. They should really consider making some changes before someone get sick. \"The whole truth so help me GOD.\"  by T.

It was noon on Friday and I pulled up and there was one car in front one on the side. Thinking this wasn't going to be good I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was the Fri before Christmas and maybe nobody at the city was working. I walked in and a gentleman got up out of a booth (not very worker looking) and walked to the counter. As he came up, he coughed a very yucky cough into his hands but made no attempt to then wash them. There was one other person there who looked like he was homeless and having a morning cup of coffee after a bottle of bourbon. Thinking...well he won't make my food, I realized...there was nobody else there, and despite it being noon...nothing had been cooked yet. Almost everything is fried and there were no smells of food at all. The menu consisted of very little grilled items and very little seafood. But I was committed at this point...who knows it could be a little known place with amazing food...I couldn't just back out. But I was saved. The man said...before we do this (I am honestly not sure what kind of transaction he thought we were making) how are you paying. I said with my card. He said oh I don't do cards that's the other guy and he's not here. When will he be back I inquired, now more curious how this joint was even open. Awwww, he should come in anytime now seeing as it is noon. I took this as my queue to leave and went somewhere with overpriced food that was well known. Looking back I wonder if the guy even worked there. Maybe someone should check the freezer for the owner.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-12-20T06:13:11-0500", "location_id": "7117387", "id": "334028663", "user": {"username": "txhawk36", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Worth, Texas", "id": "55857"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Great Food Great Prices", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56280-d7117387-r231848293-m11068-Mesquite_Grill_Seafood-Mesquite_Texas.html#review231848293", "text": "Nice casual place, with Real Food done Real Fast.
