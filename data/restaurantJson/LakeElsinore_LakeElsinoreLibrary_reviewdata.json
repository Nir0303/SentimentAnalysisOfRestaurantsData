There's a single table with some computers in the middle of the one-room library and about ten aisles of books not counting the reference section. The small size also makes it intimate enough that conversations will be heard by all, as I noted the front desk never stopped talking to each other.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-09T21:38:58-0400", "location_id": "11044915", "id": "426532011", "user": {"username": "Kauai-Biz-Traveler", "user_location": {"name": "Riverside, California", "id": "32978"}}}]}
