I saw The Music Man and a production of Disney\u2019s Little Mermaid, both were excellent.   The theater itself is comfortable without any bad seats.  It is air conditioned and parking is super easy.  The historical building is also known to be haunted!  Great fun for an evening out or a matinee with the kids \u2013 and a great value too!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-07-10T12:48:04-0400", "location_id": "10084902", "id": "391127152", "user": {"username": "eatonmike", "user_location": {"name": "Seal Beach, California", "id": "33067"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Very Good Community Live Theater", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32576-d10084902-r356673578-m11068-La_Habra_Depot_Theatre-La_Habra_California.html#review356673578", "text": "We attended Fame The Musical at this small theater. It only has about 100 or so seats so everyone is close to the stage. The seats are comfortable. This musical was performed by local dance and vocal students so don't' expect a Broadway quality production. But the young people put on a great show. The prices are reasonable and there is plenty of parking.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-18T18:02:25-0400", "location_id": "10084902", "id": "356673578", "user": {"username": "Lance2002", "user_location": {"name": "Riverside County", "id": null}}}]}
