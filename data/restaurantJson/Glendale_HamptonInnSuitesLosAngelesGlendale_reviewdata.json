The manager and every member of the staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs from an early checkin to making and serving the waffles at breakfast. We were offered the opportunity to use a nearby fitness center and be reimbursed for the cost of the day pass if we desired. The property is just across the street from the upscale upscale Americana shopping area and about a block from the adjacent Galleria enclosed mall. There are also numerous dining options in the vicinity, ranging from In and Out to fine dining.\n\nSuggest asking for a room on the top two floors for better views and less street noise. Uneven numbers face Colorado Street with the mountains in the background (attractive retail development in the foreground), higher numbers will be farther from the elevator and icemaker. Modern AC in the rooms with a thermostat and quiet fan (none of the clanking and rattling you sometimes hear with the \"window\" type units). Pulldown blackout roller shades kept out the street light at night and provided privacy. Plenty of power and USB jacks to charge electronic devices without having to set them on the floor or use extension cords.
