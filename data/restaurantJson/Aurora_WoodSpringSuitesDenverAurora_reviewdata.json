The next day came, we attempted again.This time, the toilet paper was a part of the \"linen exchange\" program that cost $9.87 to be a part of. The linen exchange program is a service that the hotel will wash your sheets and towels weekly, as well as give you new trash bags and toilet paper. So that being said, we found out that it is the guest's responsibility to secure their own toilet paper. I can not believe the type of hotel that doesn't have the extremely cheap toilet paper automatically provided for customers. Explain to me how toilet paper is physically a \"linen\" though. That's an argument for another time. This ghetto establishment has its own internet publicist ready to respond to any negative reviews. The management couldn't have acted more unprofessional, as well as the staff couldn't appear to be more unprofessional. The area manager, Nate, couldn't have treated me as a paying guest more, more unprofessionally. Just know this place is not worth it, no matter how much you save. Worst hotel experience possible.
