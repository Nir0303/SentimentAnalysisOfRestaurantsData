I didnt' want to hurt his feelings and tell him I really don't like the place. I wish I would of. The food was nothing to write home about but the atmosphere was and not in a good way. The people sitting behind us were were two woman and two young children. One of the ladies looked like she was spaced out on something. The children were running up and down the isles disturbing the guest and the wait staff.  We finally had to call the manager over to speak to them about this.  Why parents let their children run around uncontrolled is beyond me. The manager finally the situation under control. It just ruined the whole experience for us.

I don't care if I never go back. The food was ok but that was the only good thing about the place. Our waitress was as slow as molasses in January.  On top of that she wanted to visit with not wait on the customers.  She told me at one point I would like to visit with you. I didn't come to Chili's to talk to waitress.  I came there to visit with my friend. I wasn't sure what I wanted because I never eat there but ordered something just so she would leave the table.   The place was not very busy but they insisted on putting all of the customers together and some were rather loud so I was having a hard time listening to the person I was having dinner with. They also had a live singer in there and she must of had a butcher knife with her because she butchered every song she tried to sing. Truth be told she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.  However if you didn't like her they also had the piped in music as well both going on at the same time.  Needless to say I was glad to leave and won't go back.\nIf want to have ok food with crummy service and atmosphere this is the place for you.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-11-16T12:05:50-0500", "location_id": "2571783", "id": "184910647", "user": {"username": "southernpilot01", "user_location": {"name": "ALBANY,GA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-08", "title": "More than just a bar", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29192-d2571783-r173527161-m11068-Chill_Bar_and_Lounge-Albany_Georgia.html#review173527161", "text": "Chili's is not just a bar as stated in the description.
