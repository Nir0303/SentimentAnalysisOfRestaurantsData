We try out new places in the Antelope Valley all the time, just to get some variety and good eats. This time my sister suggested we try AM Cafe. My first impression as we walked in was noticing that \"at home\" feel and how warm and friendly the waitresses are. They shouted out, \"sit whereever you'd like\"......Wow..this was going to be good experience, I could just feel it. (Skip to me receiving my food, I ordered the AM omelet and asked for double sausage instead of bacon and sausage). Wow...looks good, I dug right in! Right away I noticed a freezer burn taste and a slighly racid taste. I ignored it at first thinking it was just that piece, so I keep going cause I'm greedy and hungry and then by the third bite, I can't help it, I had to stop eating, it was just that bad. After the waitress asked if I'd like a to-go container, I politely let her know how it taste and she said, \"hummm we don't freeze anything\" and I responded, \"I don't know what it could be.\" Then I think she apologized, not sure but she did offer to take my order off the bill, I agreed with no further discussion.\n\nNow here goes the disappointment: After receiving the bill, I noticed the waitress didn't take the meal off as she said. When I pointed this out to her, she said she had to get the manager/owner cause she didn't know???? Know \"what\" I thought,   but I didn't question it. When the owner MIKE came back, he just stood there and looked, in a \"can I help you\" manner. I explained why I was still standing there waiting and he started shaking his head and saying things like: We made this omelet special for you and .... well everybody else liked their food...i guess I'll just take the loss...he was very upset with me and went on and on...I said, \"that's okay, don't take it off if you don't want to\" ....then he went on and on again....even showing me on the bill where someome else ordered the same omelet with no complaint (she was later sick, by the way). I repeated and this time insisting...don't take it off. He responded, I already did! All the while shaking his head like I did something wrong, insinuating that I lied..even though the omelet was not eaten, never once apologizing.  Never have I ever experienced such rude behavior and this person was the owner. The waitress was nice and thanked us as we left but the owner did not. I was sooo disappointed and expected better. Hopefull after this review the owner will contact me and apologize for his horrible behavior. If you eat here and you're ASKED how things are tasting ....if your food taste a little off, don't TELL!

I had the \"Mexican eggs Benedict\" and found them delightful even though the eggs we a touch over poached for my taste. The Canadian bacon was a nicely cut piece with some heft to it, not just a suggestion of meat we so often find in Benedicts. The wife's oatmeal and fresh fruit were offered up in very large portion, enough so that we wound up taking fruit home. \n\nIn all an excellent dining experience and we will be back.\n\nThanks to Sandra for attentive but unintrusive service.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-06-18T14:09:04-0400", "location_id": "1067090", "id": "210991318", "user": {"username": "Wintalldude", "user_location": {"name": "Palmdale, California", "id": "32848"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Delightful", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32607-d1067090-r184672682-m11068-A_M_Cafe-Lancaster_California.html#review184672682", "text": "A great place to eat breakfast, Mike and his staff are awesome.
