We were there on a weekday when it was supposed to open.  It did not open until about 15 minutes later.  There was only one employee there and instead of seating those who were waiting (@10 people), he starting making iced tea and messing around in the back doing other things......totally ignoring the customers.  We walked out.  That was the one and only time my wife and I were there.

That must be the first buyer beware.  But he is also an excellent cook and a believer in make it the way the customer wants it.  Texas is full of great bar be cue joints. This is one of them.  But there is variety.  I had him hook up a grilled catfish and it was awesome...well flavored, tasty and served with the best ribbon cut fresh potato i have ever had.  From my colleague's report, the bar be cue was awesome.  \n\nGive it a try. Low cost. Low key.  A little slow in service.
