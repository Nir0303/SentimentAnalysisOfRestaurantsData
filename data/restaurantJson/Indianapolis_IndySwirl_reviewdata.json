As I took a sample taste, I noted that it tasted MUCH creamier and more like ice cream than other chain frozen yogurts I'd had. The gentleman there said that many other frozen yogurts weren't real yogurt at all, but Indy Swirl makes their frozen yogurt with the best ingredients- it's REAL frozen yogurt. I believe it!  They have an excellent toppings bar which includes things like real red velvet cake pieces, South Bend candies, pieces of waffle cones, wonderful nuts, and all the usual toppings. The price was comparable to other frozen yogurt places but with a much better product.\nYou can either sit inside or outside and watch the happenings on the Circle. They also sell a wide selection of specialty bottled beverages like Triple XXX Root Beer (from Triple XXX in West Lafayette), Cheerwine, and much more. We bought a little carton of those to take home for a special occasion.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-07-10T08:34:20-0400", "location_id": "4473591", "id": "167057248", "user": {"username": "MackinacMegan", "user_location": {"name": "Fishers, IN", "id": null}}}]}
