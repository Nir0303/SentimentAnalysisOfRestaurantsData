The restraunt is clean.  The waitstaff is very friendly.  Their chips and salsa are the best.  My favorite entree there is the shrimp tacos.  They do have a kids menu for the younger ones which include items like chicken fingers and tacos.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-06-10T15:42:37-0400", "location_id": "2572062", "id": "279381620", "user": {"username": "Cindy B", "user_location": {"name": "Westland, Michigan", "id": "42811"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Average Mexican food, but the service wasn't very good.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42811-d2572062-r263082149-m11068-New_Mexico_Restaurant-Westland_Michigan.html#review263082149", "text": "The food was average Mexican. Nothing special. The waitstaff was not very good.\n\nThe waitress had dropped one of my husband's taco's before delivering it to our table. She apologized and said she'd bring a new one. Not a problem, however, she didn't bring it until we finally reminded her again. We were done with our meal at this point because she hadn't checked back with us at all during our meal.\n\nBoth our meals were supposed to have sour cream included. I didn't get any sour cream. I asked for it and she said she would bring it. She never did.\n\nThe restroom is old and dirty.
