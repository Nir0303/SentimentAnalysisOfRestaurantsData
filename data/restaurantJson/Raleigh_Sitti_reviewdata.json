Yesterday evening, I made a reservation for five for one of our friend's birthdays. The atmosphere is friendly yet professional, and with a taste of family tradition at its heart. Our waiter, Jarred, was the keystone of what made our evening a success. From beginning to end he was a delight to interact with, had ample knowledge of the menu and was thorough in answering questions as well as offering suggestions. Then there is the food. Do you ever take a bite of something and actually have to take a moment, sit back, and just let the taste offer a one-of-kind experience to your senses? That's the kind of food I'm talking about here. We had an assortment of cheese and cold dips for our appetizers with pita bread that was both traditional and fall inspired with with our wines. Perfection. Each of us chose a different main dish from lamb, to chicken, to my dish of tempeh. As a vegetarian, I can tell you that Sitti gets tempeh right 100%. I've been meatless for just about 10 years and this tempeh was the best I can ever recall having (and I've had some *really* awful tempeh in that time). For the meat eaters at the table, their reactions were similar to mine. Everyone was beyond pleased and we found ourselves swapping dishes where we could so everyone could get a taste. For desert, we split the sweet potato cheese cake with the baklava crust and the friend banana with raspberry sorbet. What a perfect way to end the evening. Last night was one of my most fun in memory and I will most certainly be returning to Sitti for my next special occasion!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-05T08:09:17-0400", "location_id": "1216446", "id": "425320198", "user": {"username": "Rebekah C", "user_location": {"name": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "id": "28970"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Lebanese Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49463-d1216446-r424794736-m11068-Sitti-Raleigh_North_Carolina.html#review424794736", "text": "Amazing Food!!
