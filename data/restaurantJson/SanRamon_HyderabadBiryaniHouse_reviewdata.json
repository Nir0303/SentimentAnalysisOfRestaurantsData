It really is hit or miss. Sometimes the food has been really interesting and other times, like last night, the special for the evening was uninspired. Served in a sealed plastic container, I had the thought that the night's lamb curry special had been made some other time and put in the fridge, then microwaved specially for me. Any case, it was not so interesting and not nearly as inspired as some of the other food I have eaten here. It is a place where you can just let them choose for you, if the tall gentleman is taking orders and sees you are uncertain what to order. He will put together a selection for you. \n\nWhere, oh where, could that London Indian food be hiding in the Bay Area....?", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-11T09:33:54-0400", "location_id": "4569827", "id": "372123709", "user": {"username": "Randall B", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": "60713"}}}]}
