I witnessed 2 tables being kicked out by police (never seen that before). This year's Melodrama was NOT written well. The moviolas were way too long! And the audience's attention span was lost with-in the first scene. However, the intermissions and Olio were great fun!!! I was so disappointed with the melodrama this year, which is why I decided to write this review. By all means, I hope they pick a better story line/writer next year. \n\nFor all those that have never experienced Summer Mummers. You boo at the villain's and cheer for the hero's and throw popcorn at anyone sitting around you at any opportune moment. Loads of fun!!!!
