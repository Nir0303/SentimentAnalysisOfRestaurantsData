I ordered a brisket sandwich and my wife pulled pork sandwich. We received our food in about twenty five minutes. After taking the first bite of my brisket sandwich I realized it was extremely tough. Ugh! I took a closer look and noticed that the meat was DRY and did not look good. I then cut the meat with a knife (hard to do) and tried just the meat. It was tough and had little taste. Certainly not what brisket should taste like and definitely the worst I had ever had... period. I thought okay this could just be a bad menu choice, but then I looked at my wife and after a bite of her pulled pork sandwich she removed the bun and started \"picking\" around with a fork. I asked her what was going on and she said no worries, it's okay. She is a very kind lady and would never complain, so I inquired further and she said the sandwich was almost all fat and quietly said nothing else. My wife is NOT a picky eater so this was to take note of. After some time I realized she just pushed the plate to the edge of the table and a server picked it up. What are the chances both our lunches were a fluke. Hence my review and know that I do this just to forewarn others and to say shame on you (management) for allowing \"food\" like this to be served. Not the memorable experience we were hoping for.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-08T16:01:18-0500", "location_id": "2334593", "id": "248365001", "user": {"username": "Terry K", "user_location": {"name": "Payson, Arizona", "id": "31305"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Great Service!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d2334593-r245553324-m11068-Tom_s_Tavern_1929_Grill-Phoenix_Arizona.html#review245553324", "text": "I sat at the bar and watched an amazing bartender juggle multiple patrons and provide excellent service.
