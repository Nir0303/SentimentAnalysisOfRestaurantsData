Loved the salad which had a nice piece of feta cheese on top - Mmmmmm - but the skewered pork was a bit overcooked which rendered the meat a bit on the tough side.  Thought the fries were good.

It will be a long time before we try it again.  \n\nIt started off fine, we were seated immediately, brought water and ordered drinks.  It was happy hour so we both ordered a glass of house wine.  The waiter came and took our order.  The appetizer (eggplant rolls) came out fairly quickly and it was really good.  The waiter said bread would be ready in 2 minutes.  Then our main course was brought to us by a runner and it also was good.  Note, the bread never made it to our table.\n\nWe never saw the waiter after he brought us the appetizer until it was time to bring the bill.  No one asked if our food was okay, if we needed anything, would like another glass of wine, nothing.  \n\nI was extremely disappointed especially since we just got back from being in Greece 2 weeks ago and would have loved to find a nice place to get Greek food.
