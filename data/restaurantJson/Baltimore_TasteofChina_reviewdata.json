Chinese food was the best option we found that would deliver to our hotel and we took a chance on this place based on a recommendation from an employee of the hotel.  We were very happy with our choice and almost knocked off our feet with the quality of the food delivered to us.\n\nWe ordered the Four Family as our main dish, served with white rice.  The Shrimp was excellent, beef was tender and spicy, chicken delicious, and porl great.  Veggies were cooked crispy and cut bite sized, not in enormous chunks like so many other places do.  I must add that the rice was perfectly cooked, not dry and not wet.  Very flavorful rice and went well with the food.\n\nWe had the Crab Rangoons as our appetizer and found pieces of what appeared to be real crab, not imitation in the cream cheese.  The wanton wrappers were NOT burned or undercooked, but, as Goldilocks would have said, \"Just right.\" They even gave us a \"free\" bottle of water with the order.  \n\nThe amount of food we received was perfect for the two of us to split.  The only con was there was only one fork, but got another from the hotel bar.  Delivery was extra, so be prepared for that, but is was very fast - less than 20 min. from my call to the door of the hotel.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-11-07T19:00:48-0500", "location_id": "485906", "id": "238699280", "user": {"username": "GeneT223", "user_location": {"name": "Sophia, North Carolina", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "For A Take Out Dive - Not Too Bad", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d485906-r234947323-m11068-Taste_of_China-Baltimore_Maryland.html#review234947323", "text": "So I got some chix fried rice tonight.
