My brother was visiting from out of town. The food was like our Mother used to make. The ambiance, service and food were all outstanding. It is a small restaurant  but there were tables for parties of 6 and even 10 set up.

Portion is small for American standard especially the appetizer, like its potato pancake, only 4 small slices.  Side dish for roast duck charging $24 before tax and tips is also too less\n2. Menu is kept changing from time to time, the side dish is different from what I saw in yelp.\n3. Maybe Chinese look all the same (mainlanders are notoriously for bad manners during travel to museums and tourist spots but famous for buying huge volume of luxurious goods with guanxi money), the cashier asked if I paid 20 bucks less while I counted twice before I give the money to her.   I asked her to recount again.  She then apologize.  But This is really bad, though I think the food is great, I won't go back to eat again forever, this is the same horrible experience I found in many places in Singapore.   No other restaurants in the States even doubted me like this.\n\nI am really disappointed.  I sincerely hope that it will not happen again to other Chinese-looking tourists.  I took out 2 stars as a result.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-02-08T10:13:52-0500", "location_id": "350093", "id": "253219798", "user": {"username": "Max L", "user_location": {"name": "Shanghai, China", "id": "308272"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Expand your dining with a delicious visit to Warsaw and Polish cuisine", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33052-d350093-r252891751-m11068-Warszawa_Restaurant-Santa_Monica_California.html#review252891751", "text": "What a terrific place to dine. Located in a beautiful old house and decorated like something right out of Warsaw with old world touches but modern beautiful Polish art on the walls.

Great appetizers, excellent entrees, perfect desserts if you have room to get to them. Out table had a variety of pierogies( must try them) soup- out of this world and then on to entrees. Many selections so our table had trout simmered with leeks and tomatoes, another dinner the schnitzel and others opting for the special scallops for that evening. yes- sumptuous servings with perfect sides of vegetables/ potato/other starch  all included. Generous portions of well prepared food. Service was lovely and all dining seemed very pleased with their meal and the ambiance of this must try place. I understand they have a great variety of vodka as well for those who are looking for high quality spirits.
