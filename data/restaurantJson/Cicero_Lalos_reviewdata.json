Lalo's does have menu items that have Mexican names, and most of the common taco/burrito ingredients, but I seriously doubt people in Mexico would eat at Lalo's if they had one there. \n\n I wanted to have fish tacos, but they were out. Neither tacos nor burrito sounded good, so I tried something called Huevos Mexicano, with chorizo. It came with sides of beans and rice, which were edible. The huevos were not. My companion had  potato & egg tacos - nothing delicious about them. The tortillas were fresh, but that is the only good thing I can say about this restaurant. There were plenty of sandwich places in the same food court, and we regretted not trying one of those instead of Lalo's.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-02-14T12:58:27-0500", "location_id": "430506", "id": "152134042", "user": {"username": "Drumonkey23", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, MA", "id": null}}}]}
