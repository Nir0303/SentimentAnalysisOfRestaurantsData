If you are adventurous like The Monk (that's me) you don't mind taking the old highway or the road into town to find that memorable Mom & Pop with the spe- cial pancakes or a favorite local dish.  \n\nLocated about 6 mi from the freeway, The Spring House seemed promising, with its full parking lot and a real home-town look and feel, rare along the over-signed and generally tacky Main St of Hesperia.  The entry area walls were covered with photos of smiling kids' soccer teams and plaques boasting of management's hosting of service clubs.  I liked that.\n\nService was fast and friendly.  The menu is huge, sort of the \"Lucky Greek\" style of a little bit of every- thing all American, with breakfast served anytime that is typical of Southern California mid-century Mom and Pop's.  Most of the clientele were seniors and apparent locals.  I doubt the Spring House caters much to tourists and freeway traffic.  The parking and rest rooms were satisfactory, however the entire property is becoming run down and needs paint and patching here and there.  But the dining area was still pretty clean.\n\nMy food was average, typical breakfast fare of eggs, pancakes and sausage.  I think the grapefruit juice was watered down, you know, those over-sugared \"cocktail\" disappointments.  Portion sizes for all were fine.  \n\nBottom line:  Don't waste your time 'springing off' the Interstate, fighting Main St traffic and garish advertising to visit the Spring House.

I ordered a simple hamburger. My thinking was that a diner that is so loved by many people in the area that they would be able to create a great burger. I was wrong. The hamburger was good, but I could get a better one at fast food joint. The patty was from a frozen package, I was able to tell from the no taste and the seam line that was put from the production machine at the factory. I looked at the other plate within my group and saw that the breaded shrimp was also a once frozen product, created in some factory. So was he Malibu Chicken plate, with a slice of ham from a store package. Other items on our plates seem to be also from a production factory. It is sad to see that a diner like this can not get away from this type of food. If they had, a hamburger was 100% fresh and made by hand with some seasoning I would be will to pay the needed price for that type of food. There is so much great food that could come out of this restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2011-08-14T07:10:21-0400", "location_id": "541573", "id": "116703298", "user": {"username": "mou2", "user_location": {"name": "Victorville, California", "id": "33224"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Mediocre service and greasy food too on 2/5/10", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32491-d541573-r55261832-m11068-Spring_House_Restaurant-Hesperia_California.html#review55261832", "text": "waited 15 minutes before server even acknoledged that I was there, and then blamed it on the manager.
