They are known for their wings which I did not try and opted for appetizers only. I had the very tasty jalape\u00f1o artichoke dip with thick chips so they never broke. I had artichoke in every bite. Also tried the fried ravioli which were so so a little over cooked. Good neighborhood feel and will definitely go again and try the wings and one of their salads.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-24T23:10:04-0400", "location_id": "8758179", "id": "367076483", "user": {"username": "takemeaway50", "user_location": {"name": "concord", "id": null}}}]}
