Chinese food is not generally all that healthy, so finding a restaurant that serves organic ingredients and prepared in a more healthy fashion was delightful. \nIt's in an out of sight location (not visible from the streets) so I'm glad to have checked on Yelp.\nAlmost every is solid on their menu. Jidori chicken, pork chops, jelly fish & chicken or Hainan chicken with tasty rice, chicken wings etc etc.  The hot pots and fish dishes also look good. The ingredients are fresh and although it is on the blend side, I know it's because there is less fat and sodium. \nThe restaurant has both an indoor dining area with about 10 tables/booths and a covered outdoor dining patio with heat lamps for about 40. \nSimple furnishings. Prices are quite reasonable and the quality is consistent.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-24T20:14:20-0500", "location_id": "3731981", "id": "342488873", "user": {"username": "wing49er", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-12", "title": "Healthy & Delicious", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32738-d3731981-r148550746-m11068-Farm_Cuisine-Monterey_Park_California.html#review148550746", "text": "First of all, you will drive right by this place if you're not aware where it is.  It's in the BACK of the shopping center.  Fortunately, there are parking spaces back there.  This is a new restaurant, not competing against all of the cheap Chinese restaurants in town.  It is unique among restaurants in that the service is literally 5 Star. The waiters go out of their way to make sure things are impeccable.  Each dish is tastefully placed on the serving platter.  Go here for a respite away from the hustle & bustle of Monterey Park.  The food is organic, healthy and delicious.  Perhaps the menu is a bit hard to read but the waiters can easily help you out.  Definitely health oriented, no heavy, oily sauces here.  In fact, when we asked for some hot sauce, the waiter told us the owner specifically did not  want to mask the freshness with spicy sauces.  They did give us 10% off (unexpected) for our comments about how to improve the restaurant.  The restroom is shared with an adjoining establishment and hence, they do not provide liquor.\n\nGo to this restaurant, try some different dishes and enjoy the simplicity and flavors of the organic ingredients.  I think you will like it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-01-01T16:07:17-0500", "location_id": "3731981", "id": "148550746", "user": {"username": "NorCalBigRedDog", "user_location": {"name": "Silicon Valley, CA", "id": null}}}]}
