It was disappointing to find so little to select from even though it was just before lunch. They had an abundance of products containing peanut butter and pumpkin, neither of which my family eats. I selected the last four chocolate rocky road brownies in the counter and a small key lime pie. The pie was so old and dry a fork wouldn't cut through the filling. The brownies would have been good except they too were stale.\nI know it is difficult to rotate baked goods, but also feel they should be removed from the counter after a day or two.\nThis is not an establishment I would patronize again. They would benefit from an outside consultant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-11-03T13:22:42-0500", "location_id": "6707576", "id": "237857654", "user": {"username": "Ama M", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Indiana", "id": "37361"}}}]}
