I tried the traditional (steak), pork belly, and Asian (w pork belly) . \n\nThe traditional Steak-\nThe traditional are out of this world...well seasoned steak ...a layer of cheese melted  between two blue corn tortillas. Topped w  cilantro onion and cheese (lettuce and tomato are usually included, I opted out)\n5 out of 5\n\nPork belly-  Pork belly topped with crisp sauteed red cabbage and pineapple salsa...at first I was hesitant to add the pineapple salsa (I got it in the side) I tried taco with just got sauce... Super flavorful...after adding the pineapple salsa it turned into a Pork belly party in my mouth!  There were so many complimentary layers of flavor it took my untrained pallets a moment to catch up. \n\nAsain-\nThe Asian I chose to get w Pork belly ( chicken, tilapia or steak are also available) it's topped with Asian cabbage coleslaw\nIt was quite good ! There is a sweetness to this one that is tempered by the bitter crunch of the coleslaw .. The pairing of the 2 was fantastic. \n\nAll ingredients used in each taco I tried tasted fresh and flavorful. \nVery relaxed casual atmosphere\nGood prices\nStaff was very helpful and friendly w my numerous questions.\n\n \n\nI will definitely be back and I will be suggesting to everyone I know! \n\n", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-27T12:11:25-0400", "location_id": "7210870", "id": "368244940", "user": {"username": "FisherRich", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": "35805"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Fusion tacos = good tacos", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36185-d7210870-r346459422-m11068-The_Blue_Taco-Joliet_Illinois.html#review346459422", "text": "I work across the street so I have visited this place a lot in the last year or two.
