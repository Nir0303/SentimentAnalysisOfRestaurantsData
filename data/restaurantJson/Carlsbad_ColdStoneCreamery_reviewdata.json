Once the novelty wears off, location, product quality, and service keep you in business.  If this Coldstone was in a location that required repeat customers to stay in business, they would be closed!   We went on the night of May 9th.  The two guys working, had one customer finishing up.  They then ignored us- not even a 'hello' or even eye contact for several minutes, until another group of people came in.  Then one begrudgingly waited on us, while the other continued to ignore the group behind us.  We told the clerk the order would be 'To-Go', yet each time he completed his mix, we had to ask for a lid, each time he smeared ice cream all over the outside of the container when he added the lid yet did not wipe it off and did not give us a bag until we asked  (4 bowls of ice cream carried by 1 person- no bag???).  The whole time, no smiles, no please, no thank you, but some serious stink eye.   Coldstones' Ice cream is usually mixed on the cold part of the stone so it refreezes, but this takes a little muscle to mix, crabby guy was not about to do that, so he mixed where the last customer's order had been mixed, on the warmest part of the slab, so the ice cream was borderline milkshake by the time it went into the bowl.)  At every opportunity to be pleasant or do his job, he had to be asked to do the minimum.
