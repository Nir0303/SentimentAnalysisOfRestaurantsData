This was our second stay at the Kalamazoo House .  The other reviewers have raved about the hosts, the breakfast, (props to Garrett),  the service...and it's all true!  So I will just jot a few notes about the two rooms that we stayed in.  The first time we stayed in room #2 which is one of their smallest and least expensive rooms with a queen size bed.  We were very comfortable, perfect if you are not planning to spend a lot of time in the room as there aren't chairs to lounge in or a desk (but you can use the tables and chairs in the beautiful common areas downstairs).  The location of this room at the top of the stairs may be less than ideal if you are a light sleeper, like I am, since the the other guests have to pass by the room to get to theirs.  The second time, we stayed in room #11, which is also a queen size room but located on the third floor.  This room is a little larger and has two chairs for lounging and a desk and was very quiet.  However, since the room is on the third floor the ceiling was slanted in the bathroom, which was fine for me, but a little cramped for my tall husband.  I think next time (and there will definitely be a next time), we will splurge for one of the larger rooms.

The rooms were exceptionally clean and fully stocked with amenities. The breakfast was home made to order by signing up the night before, as we received homemade cookies from the chef.
