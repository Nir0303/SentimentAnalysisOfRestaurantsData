Even though most people can\u2019t pronounce its name correctly (some just stop trying and inexplicably call it \u201cLittle Italy\u2019), the food and atmosphere speak for themselves. There\u2019s a reason this great Little Italian Restaurant has thrived in a relatively obscure setting. You don\u2019t just happen upon this place; you must make a conscious decision to go there, and people have bene doing it for a long time.\nOur most recent experience affirmed our well-established impression of L\u2019Italiano.   We were there to celebrate a relative\u2019s 70th birthday. It was his first time at the restaurant, and he couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. We can say the same for ourselves. We started with Mozzarella E Pomodoro.  The tomatoes were good enough. They probably were not garden-fresh, and this time of year that would have been a real plus; but the key to this salad is the cheese-pesto combination.  The mozzarella had a nice texture and the pesto was slightly bold. The overall effect was very pleasing.\nThe diner special this evening was tenderloin with a green peppercorn sauce and saut\u00e9ed spinach. The dish and presentation were first-rate, a real treat. Coincidentally two of the three diners ordered Salsiccia Abruzzese as an entr\u00e9e. The sausage was spicy without being overbearing while the pasta and sauce were a perfect compliment to the sausage, onions and peppers.  \nFor dessert, we shared the cannoli, which was light a pleasing.\nL\u2019Italiano is a small restaurant, but that\u2019s part of its charm. The servers have the opportunity to give diners the appropriate amount of attention, and they do it well. Our waiter was engaging and attentive. We were never left wanting for bread or beverage and yet he was not at all obtrusive. He pulled off that delicate balancing act quite well.\nThis restaurant consistently produces a quality dining experience. It\u2019s definitely worth poking around the streets of \u201cold Bossier\u201d to find it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-22T06:30:46-0400", "location_id": "410861", "id": "384881876", "user": {"username": "Darrell R", "user_location": {"name": "Shreveport, Louisiana", "id": "40424"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "A Nice Local Restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40044-d410861-r383633967-m11068-L_italiano_Restaurant-Bossier_City_Louisiana.html#review383633967", "text": "Found this place through Yelp!

The d\u00e9cor and ambience of the restaurant is old fashioned, traditional and romantic.  We were attended to, by the wait staff, quickly and efficiently.  I ordered the Piatto Freddo as an appetizer whilst we pondered on our entrees. The Piatto Freddo came quickly and was easily enough for the two of us to share with a good selection of fresh cheeses, olives and cured meats, I could have just eaten this with the fresh bread and a glass of wine but was looking forward to my entr\u00e9e.\n\nI eventually decided on the Pollo Paridisio, grilled chicken breast with saut\u00e9ed crawfish tails in a white wine, cream and creole mustard sauce topped with mushrooms, and a side of steamed broccoli.  My wife, who didn't want a large entr\u00e9e after the appetizer, chose a bowl of Minestrone soup and the Mozzarella E Pomodoro (fresh tomatoes and mozzarella).  \n\nOur food was prepared and served to us in a very reasonable amount of time.  My chicken breast was succulent and delicious, the sauce was outstanding and a perfect consistency and the broccoli was cooked perfectly.  My wife's soup and mozzarella was also very fresh and delicious.\n\nAlthough tempted with desert we chose not too since we had eaten enough, so rounded off the meal with coffee.  Total bill, food, glass of wine, beer and 2 coffees was less than $80, outstanding value for this class of restaurant.\n\nThank you, L'Italiano Restaurant, we will return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-09T07:07:51-0500", "location_id": "410861", "id": "346245823", "user": {"username": "Ian71037", "user_location": {"name": "Bossier City, Louisiana", "id": "40044"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Old fashioned romantic italian!!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40044-d410861-r345953036-m11068-L_italiano_Restaurant-Bossier_City_Louisiana.html#review345953036", "text": "A favorite of locals and tourists!!!
