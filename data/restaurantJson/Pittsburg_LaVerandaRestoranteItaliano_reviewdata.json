Arrived in the area to find a very busy downtown due to a car show, so had to park and then walk a few blocks to access this restaurant.  Bar was very busy due to the downtown activities.  Dining area not so much, however found it interesting that at least 2 male managers/floor leads ignored me for about 5 minutes at the front podium as I waited to be acknowledged and seated.  Once seated the server was attentive and helpful!  She made a few great recommendations and I enjoyed the eggplant and penne pasta.  Generous servings and authenitic Italian flavors.  Bread served was mediocre...kinda of stale with an interesting marinara style dip.  Wine servings were generous also.  Server was attentive throughout the meal.  She is part of the reason for the 4 stars!  Not a memorable meal but appreciate the convenience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-08-15T18:49:11-0400", "location_id": "1790736", "id": "299704517", "user": {"username": "CondosOnTheBeach", "user_location": {"name": "Atlanta,GA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Try the Salmon Salad!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32895-d1790736-r299509526-m11068-La_Veranda_Restorante_Italiano-Pittsburg_California.html#review299509526", "text": "I've only eaten here a handful of times and always order the Salmon Salad, which is quite good.
