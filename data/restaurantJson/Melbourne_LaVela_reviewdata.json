We figured after about a year in business, they should have it together by now. Nope. We were wrong. First, when we got there, the menu was totally different. It was very limited & the items that we thought about getting weren't offered. We told our server, who attempted to be very accommodating, however, the chef wasn't! My husband asked if he could get soup instead of a salad, since there was no soup on this menu & there were soups offered on the online menu. He asked for pasta fagioli & our server said he'd tell the chef. I asked for a Caesar salad & asked if they had anchovies to put on it & was told yes. Our server came back & said no pasta fagioli. How about a seafood soup? My husband decline & ordered the same Casesar salad with anchovies as I did. We received our salads without anchovies & with stale bread pretending to be croutons. The salad was good & we were hungry & since our server didn't deliver the salads & didn't come around to check on us until they were almost done, we never got our anchovies, although we did tell our server that they were missing. He offered to get us some anchovies, but it was too late. My husband had a strange piece of something in his salad. We're not sure if it was maybe an artichoke, but it wasn't part of the salad, that's for sure. We were asked if we wanted bread with our meal. Of course! Little did we know we would be charged $2 for it. Who charges for bread?! We were offered a strange mix of olive oil & balsamic for dipping it into. Our main courses were ordered. I ordered a fusilli pasta dish & got rigatoni. It was supposed to have kalamata olives in it & it probably had about 1 olive sliced up in the whole dish. It also had eggplant in it, which was way under cooked & crunchy. The server took my dish away & came back a minute later with a piping hot dish with fusilli. How it got cooked that fast is beyond me. My husband ordered some seafood pasta dish which was served with a closed mussel & he didn't get the small fork to use for the clams, nor was he asked if he wanted any crushed red pepper for the dish. After dinner, we decided to have a drink & asked if they had black Sambuca. Our server said that they did, but in about a minute or so later, he came back & they didn't have any. We decided to call it a night & left. Later that night, I was sicker than a dog. Never have I ever gotten that ill after a meal.

Long story short, my daughter's steak never arrived. 45 minutes later, the waitress told her the cook had cooked another steak in the Marshall a sauce again. My steak had grown cold while waiting for my daughter's steak to arrive, so the whole meal was a bust. The manager never came to our table to explain or to apologize, but left all that customer relations work to the poor waitress. My daughter and SIL are local and said this is the second time they've had a bad experience at this restaurant. We weren't charged for my daughter's meal, but really shouldn't have been charged for any of it. The people at tbe next table had a problem too and finally left after just paying for their drinks.

Our waiter seemed he was stretched and had us waiting a long time we had to flag him down and ask for drinks and bread.  We did notice the pizza pie guy was frustrated too waiting for his pizzas to be picked up.

The fish was served over their homemade risotto with a touch of red sauce on 1/2 of the top.  Great for dipping our bread in, which we did have to order seperately at $2 for the basket.  It was crispy and very hot and made from their own dough!  The wine was delicious and it was the house wine, so very inexpensive!  We are in our early 70's and look for special places like this.  Our salad was delicious and actually had tomatoes and cucumbers on it.  We also had an Italian dessert, it was soooooo good!  We ordered an after dinner drink, paid the bill and the waiter \"Henry\" was kind enough to bring it to their outdoor bar where we sat and admired their beautiful blue lights.  We noticed inside that their pizza's looked absolutely great as they were made in their wood burning brick oven.  They will even put on a Baseball game on TV if you so desire.
