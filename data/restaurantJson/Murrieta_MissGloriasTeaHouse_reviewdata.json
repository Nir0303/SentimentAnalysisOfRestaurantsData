While we were immediately made to feel at home, we also felt as though we'd been transported to England for a traditional \"Afternoon Tea\".  \n\nWe were offered tiny sandwiches, scones, pastries, and of course a wide selection of teas. The atmosphere is cozy, quiet, and perfect for a meal among friends at any time of day.  We hated to leave, but will be returning very soon with more friends who are looking for a warm and unique dining experience.\n\nMiss Gloria does group events like after-church socials and children's theme parties, and will work with anyone who wants to design a special event.  She donates a portion of her profits to \"Precious Little Butterflies\", a local non-profit organization that supports kids in shelters and foster homes who are victims or witnesses to domestic violence.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-27T05:37:17-0400", "location_id": "6920747", "id": "217757094", "user": {"username": "Judy U", "user_location": {"name": "Murrieta, California", "id": "32764"}}}]}
