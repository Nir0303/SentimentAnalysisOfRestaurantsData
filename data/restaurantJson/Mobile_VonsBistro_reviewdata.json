The server explained the special menu is only around for a week and once it's gone...that's it. Anything on their regular menu is great too but you can get it anytime so she suggested the specials. They serve a Southern Korean blend of you can imagine but I tell you it works. We ordered the Korean Meatloaf topped with crisp pork belly served with Asian veggies and fried rice with an Asian glaze and the Redfish topped with a shrimp and crawfish creole sauce over a gulf crab dressing. I tell you that I've been on a strict portion control diet for months and intended to split it and take half home for the next day. I blew that. If I would have had a heal of bread, I would have stopped every last drop...and almost did. The meatloaf was equally was yummy bathe fried rice as a little different but wonderful taste. I think it was the fresh ginger that is grown by Vons mother in her greenhouse. They also have bread pudding and banana pudding and cheesecake and other homemade desserts. We were stuffed so we did not attempt one this trip.  They use many locally and homegrown veggies and seasonings. We were promptly greeted by the owner, Paul Larson, who gave us the rundown on the business. They started in the bayou and still own a food truck. His wife, Von, is the head chef and they collaborate on ideas for specials each week and offer an Asian dish, a pasta dish, a seafood dish and a fresh cut steak. Later in the meal, Von came over and spoke to us. None of it was scripted and just a \"how did you enjoy it\" dialogue that you get but they were very genuine and we felt like we were regulars and had known them forever during our first ever visit. We hope to make it one of our regular stops in downtown Mobile. They are also open for lunch but our schedules do not put us on the area during the day.

Beautiful day so we sat outside. Perfect!  Service was great. Our server knew everything about every dish. I got the chicken fried rice. I could tell it was made to order. Very fresh. Hubby got the special. Korean bbq pork bowl. He loved it.  You should find this place if you are in Mobile.

Curried shrimp tacos were the Chef's special and average according to the 19-year-old, who would've liked a little more spice.  My Bahn Mi (pork belly) tacos were AMAZING, as were the Hog tacos (BBQ).  Hibachi Grill Asian dish was also very flavorful.  The sweet-n-sour sauce with those and the sauce on the tacos was crazy good.  Also the best bread pudding with vanilla cream sauce I've ever had, and a special green tea cr\u00e8me brulee - don't leave without dessert!   Friendly service and nice street with palm trees lining it - worth walking the extra block past the Battle House for the food!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-19T14:59:13-0400", "location_id": "8674834", "id": "356879284", "user": {"username": "Sister67_13", "user_location": {"name": "Mobile, Alabama, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "One of downtowns best!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30709-d8674834-r355832191-m11068-Von_s_Bistro-Mobile_Alabama.html#review355832191", "text": "This is one of the best places in the up and coming downtown resurgence.
