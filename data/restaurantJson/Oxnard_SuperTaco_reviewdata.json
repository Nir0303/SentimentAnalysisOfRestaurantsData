I didn't worry much because I know they have a lot of surveillance camera. So I reported it in the Police Department so they can pull out the video and find information but unfortunately, the owner was very uncooperative and the Officer told me that the camera was probably just for decoration. So after that, I don't go there anymore. I don't feel as much safe as before. I'm pretty sure I can find other authentic Mexican in the area. Try Sabor next time. Also, just FYI, this restaurant only accepts cash.
