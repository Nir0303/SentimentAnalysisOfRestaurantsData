There is a full bar on the other side of the restaurant and the prices are fair and the drinks were good. The Track Shack sits right next to the train tracks (hence the name) and the kids love to see the trains go by. The staff is friendly and quick about getting your order and refills.

The wine was from those little 175ml bottles like you get on an airplane.  You have to love it!  I think most of their clientele drink beer.  We all had a great time, and a pretty decent and inexpensive lunch.  Best of all, on the way out we spotted a bank of slot machines by the door, and, since it was my friend's birthday, I put in a twenty and let her play.
