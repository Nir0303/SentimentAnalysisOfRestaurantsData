If you do have issues, don't bother bringing it up to them, they truly don't care; and even take the opportunity to express just how little they care by getting completely unnecessarily catty with you. The image attached is the real email thread, no edits except blocking out help-a-stalker type info. I apologize for the terrible spelling in the beginning (phone typing versus keyboard typing later).\n\nI oh-so-rarely ask for a company to help me out, especially when I'm clearly the idiot. I left my ID at home, that's on me. I understood the policy preventing me from getting in without an ID, I didn't argue it, I wasn't mean about it, I was just bummed out and mad at myself. It was a 40 minute drive (one-way), stand in line, get to the front, so close to putting a bad day behind me with a laughter-is-the-best-medicine attitude and a show I was really looking forward to, and... nope, I picked that night to be human, aka fallible. I didn't ask for the ticket transfer for the financial aspect, the ticket was only $20. I think more than anything I was hoping for an exchange so I wouldn't be so mad at myself. And I guess I thought I wasn't asking for the moon seeing as I had already paid the money, I was just hoping to use it on another night since I couldn't get in that night. It's a fairly common request that many other businesses have figured out how to honor, yes, including \"movies and theater events.\" Another thing other businesses have figured out how to do is just be nice, treat your customer base with some kindness and understanding. Pointing blame at me, telling me how it's all my fault and I have no right to ask for anything, then going into how much meaner you could get with me if you so chose, is the type of response I might expect from a close friend... with severe blame issues... who was having a really bad day herself, or perhaps an angry ex, or even, dare say, my mother; but from a professional business? There was absolutely no need to get so defensive and aggressive. An All Sales Final policy is not some concrete law mandated by the state that you are so powerless against you can't even act like you have a heart.\n\nNow I know that me never going there again isn't going to hurt their bottom line, and there are plenty of other, better comedy clubs that I enjoy and can spend my money at, so neither of us are going to miss each other in this break up. But I just wanted to put it out there, businesses are only open because of the people who spend their money to keep it open, and those people should be cared about. If you truly cannot do anything to help them out, you can at least be nice about it, a little sympathetic, or just, you know, professional.\n\nBut, that's just one fallible human's opinion.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-04T12:22:34-0500", "location_id": "1978019", "id": "352950999", "user": {"username": "avafree23", "user_location": {"name": "Seattle, Washington", "id": "60878"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Lots of Fun", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58775-d1978019-r338954862-m11068-Tacoma_Comedy_Club-Tacoma_Washington.html#review338954862", "text": "First time at this comedy club.

It has been years since I went to a live comedy club and this was no disappointment. Deceivingly large and well ventilated building with good seating, a full service bar, and a pretty good \"bar food\" menu. Very affordable tickets with many mid to upper tier comedians. Typical shows run about 1 1/2 hours with an 8 pm and 10 pm showings. No bad seats in the house and tables right next to the stage, if you are there early, at no extra cost. The lighting and sound system was prefect for the size of the room and didn't over power the audience. Decent parking available around the area for reasonable prices or there is some street parking available as well. Wide choice of acts that you are sure to find somebody to suit your taste. Great affordable way to spend a Saturday evening!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-07-20T15:45:44-0400", "location_id": "1978019", "id": "216480931", "user": {"username": "Lance N", "user_location": {"name": "Washington State", "id": null}}}]}
