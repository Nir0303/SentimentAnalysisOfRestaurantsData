It is so quiet and peaceful, the beds almost too comfortable, and the breakfasts delicious!  There are mini fridges in all of the rooms stocked with soda, water, wine & beer, yummy locally made candies left for you each day, and even fresh baked chocolate chip cookies :)  Ruth is very personable and welcoming, making the whole experience so positive...we are hooked on B&B's all because of our first stay here!

We found Ruth and Harley to be delightful. The house is historic, wonderfully decorated and comfortable. We stayed in the Lady Edith 1st floor room, which was comfy, pretty and quiet, and we both slept well. We were treated to a fabulous breakfast in the morning! WOW!! Ruth prepares a delicious meal, with generous portions. Everything was YummO! She also has a very attractive yard where is it nice to relax. We can't imagine a better choice in St Charles. If you're wondering who Harley is...he's her canine companion. He's a black Corgi and is absolutely one of the greatest little guys. He reminded us of our buddy Weagle, so we enjoyed his company a great deal. Thanks Ruth (and Harley) for making our stay everything we had hoped, with nice memories for our 18th Anniversary. All the Best to you in your innkeeping endeavors. You are truly an asset to Bed and Breakfast Inns of Missouri (BBIM).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2009-09-23T13:26:52-0400", "location_id": "1467272", "id": "43965035", "user": {"username": "eighty88eight", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
