The process starts by looking over the painting calendar on their website. You see an image of the picture you will be painting so you can pick a design that appeals to you. The website tells you how many seats are left in the class and you reserve online with a credit card. If you are going with others, but everyone is paying separately, there is a section on the sign up page where you tell them the other people in your group so that you sit together. \n\nThe location is a cute building in the Downtown Melbourne area. Street parking is available in front of the building, or there is a lot behind the building. When we checked in we were given frequent visitor cards that can get punched if you return to take other classes. Our names were written on paper plates at our places in the classroom and they already had the easels, canvases, brushes, water, and paints set out at our locations when we arrived. Aprons are hanging on the wall to cover your clothes. Bathrooms were available.\n\nOur class was completely full and they had a separate private party going on in a back room. The class was 80% women, with only a handful of men. However, they have some couples specific painting classes where each couple paints one half of an image on separate canvases that can be hung together (for example, two fish kissing, a wine bottle pouring into a wine glass). \n\nOnly one member of my group had been there previously, so we were mostly all completely new to the process. The instructor stood at the front of the class with his own canvas and took us step by step through the process. Another instructor walked around offering suggestions on brush strokes or to refill paint. There was a lot of laughing and poking fun at one another's painting skills (or lack there of). About half way through we took a break so that some of the background could dry and the instructor played a game seeing who had something in their purse or wallet (a spray can of mace, a dollar bill with a certain serial number, etc) with chances to win a coffee cup or wine glass with the Painting With a Twist logo. \n\nOur paintings came out better than most of us anticipated and we all agreed that we would be pleased to return to do this again in the future and that it would be a fun place to hold an adult birthday party.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-22T15:16:44-0400", "location_id": "7692016", "id": "312862005", "user": {"username": "FL_Sable", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "First Time Visit", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34433-d7692016-r304813500-m11068-Painting_With_A_Twist-Melbourne_Brevard_County_Florida.html#review304813500", "text": "This was my first time at PWT and will definitely go again.

I'm not really a strong artist at all but the instructor gave very clear instructions and also went a very good pace that wasn't boring but didn't make me feel rushed either.

Our painting for the evening was a manatee and surprisingly, mine came out actually looking like a manatee. I was pretty proud of it.\nThe other aspect of the night, the wine, was also very enjoyable. Having a drink of wine while your painting is nice and relaxing and makes it feel like a nice, adult activity instead of like a paint by numbers. However, the issue does come in to play that some people did over indulge slightly and that brought down the zen-like atmosphere.
