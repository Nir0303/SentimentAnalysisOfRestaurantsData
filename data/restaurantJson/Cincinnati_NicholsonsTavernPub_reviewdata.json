We came in on a Sunday evening at around 7pm, and there were a few folks at the bar and seated at the tables.  With all the apparently very good places to eat at in Cincinnati, this seemed like a good sign.  Also, it was literally right next door to the hotel we stayed at (21c Museum Hotel).  It was one of the tastier meals that I've had in recent memory, and pretty much everyone enjoyed what they ordered.\n\nService:  4 stars\n-There was a party going on in the back room so I think that might have tied up the servers a little, as a few seemed to be pulling double duty attending to tables and the party.  \n-Our server was initially busy taking care of other folks so one of the other servers came by quickly to take our drink order.\n-The entire staff seemed upbeat and generally to be at work.  We did not see any slouching, dragging feet or frowning faces.  Everyone that greeted us seemed cheer or at least very polite.   \n-Service was attentive and not pushy.  From the time we sat down to the time we walked out, dinner lasted about an hour and a half and our server checked in on us 3 times, not counting taking our food order.  That was just right for me.    \nFood:  4 stars\n-I would say pass on the Belhaven Beer Cheese Dip.  Its good, but not great.  The dip was fairly salty, and a bit runny for dipping the supplied chips and pretzel nuggets in.  \n-Fish and Chips:  my father ordered this, based on a table-top advert claiming it rated as the best in the country.  It was outstanding, certainly above any fish and chips we've had at other places in the US.  The server claimed this was due to using haddock instead of cod, but the breading and tartar sauce definitely helped.  Get the 3 piece order!\n-Short Ribs:  my mother ordered this, also terrific.  The short ribs (boneless) were perfectly braised, very tender and not fall-apart soft.  The polenta wasn't great but at least offset the richness of the short ribs and sauce.  The pumpkin slice was a nice tough, but the roasted seeds were a bit crunchier than mom expected.\n-Shepherd's Pie:  My wife ordered this, and this is the way Shepherd's Pie should taste.  Its all lamb, with the peas and carrots adding some color and sweetness.  The mashed potato topping was nice and dry without being overly seasoned or buttered, perfect for providing a nice background for the lamb.  Wished it was a little less salty.  \n-Lamb Burger w/ BLT+E:  The lamb patty had rosemary and one other spice mixed in (forgot what it was), but like the Shepherd's Pie the lamb flavor was very pronounced.  If you're not a huge fan of lamb, do not order this (thinking it might be like the gyro-meat you get a some sub-standard Greek place, all seasoning and no lamb).  I ordered mine medium and it came out as such.  The bacon, lettuce and tomato on top was fresh and the runny fried egg was a nice tough although I would have preferred it more fried.  So good, but at $13 and change it was a pretty expensive burger.\n-Duck Fat Fries:  flavor was OK but they were overly soggy, and very salty.  Probably could have stuck with the standard fries.\n-Fried Brussel Sprouts:  Yes, order these.  Very fried, good but again on the salty side.\n-Belhaven Scottish Ale:  definitely tasted the butterscotch and had a great creamy mouthfeel, but the toasted malt was not as pronounced as the description leads one to believe.  Decent beer.  \n-Bell's Oatsmoble Ale (cask):  very aromatic beer, great nose and smooth finish.  Went great with my burger.\nValue:  5 stars\n-Dinner for the 4 of us was $95.01 without tip and we were all very full with no leftovers at the end.  Perfect!\n-As mentioned, the burger I had was a little on the pricey side given its size but overall I felt the entrees were fairly priced.\nAtmosphere: 4 stars\n-A beautiful u-shaped bar dominates the first area as soon as you enter.  Small bar height tables line the left wall which is neat.\n-We sat in a semi-enclosed dining area with a (non-lit) fireplace, it felt cozy and was probably much quieter than dining in the bar area.\n-Lighting was dim but not overly so.  Enough that we could see our food and read menus, so it was comfortable.\n\nOverall, we had a great dinner here and if there weren't so many other highly rated restaurants in the area, I'd love to come back again for lunch or dinner.  But our stay here is short so we want to try out other places.  I'd highly recommend Nicholson's to others.  Just make sure you drink a lot of water given how salty most of the dishes seem.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-13T18:46:39-0500", "location_id": "394850", "id": "436976220", "user": {"username": "Al H", "user_location": {"name": "Bloomingdale, Illinois, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Great Pub", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60993-d394850-r433373389-m11068-Nicholson_s_Tavern_Pub-Cincinnati_Ohio.html#review433373389", "text": " This is a great place for a pint.
