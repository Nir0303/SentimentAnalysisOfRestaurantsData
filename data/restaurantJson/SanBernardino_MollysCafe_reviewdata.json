We grabbed a booth and the waitress promptly brought us menus, coffee and place settings. Our orders taken (one vegetarian omelet, one corned beef hash and scrambled eggs) and we settled in to watch the news and catch up on business emails. \n\nOur food arrived in about 10 minutes and was good and hot and hearty. If you think of a cross between what Mom used to make and hearty diner food, you'll be pretty spot on. As we were there for breakfast, I can't comment on dinner or lunch options although the menu supported both. By about 9:20 there were additional diners and business picked up.\n\nThe decor is definitely \"retro\" or \"route 66\" depending upon how you look at it. The waitress was pleasant and attentive and made sure our coffee's were constantly re-filled. We don't visit downtown San Bernardino so this was a bit of an impulse stop as we weren't really certain of what else was in the neighborhood close to our client's offices.
