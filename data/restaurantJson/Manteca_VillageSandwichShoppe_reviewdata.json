When she handed me my change, she motioned to the tip jar while asking if it was her tip!!  I put it in her jar to see if she would warm up a bit, but no, not even a \"Thank You!\"  My sandwich was brought out by the cook (I cannot imagine why there would only be two people working in the entire place - the girl behind the counter and the cook with a group as large as ours),  and the meat was so tough, I could not chew it!  The potato salad (which cost extra, came in a huge soup bowl instead of a traditional scoop with the sandwich, and was supposedly homemade, but it was watery and tasted like it came from a tub.
