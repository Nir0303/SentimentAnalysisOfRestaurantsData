The lines are always ridiculous!  Inside and the drive thru. I don't know why they are so slow!  The food is always delicious and the servings are enough to feed small armies but the lines!!  A lot of times they are waiting on more food to cook and I get that. The service is friendly and sometimes they will give us a free drink for waiting. It is also pretty clean and in a crazy busy location. I would recommend going if you are not in any hurry.
