We ordered three different tacos:Drunken Yardbird (tequila lime chicken), Pulled Pork, and Bohemian Veg. Nice variety, right? The chicken was in chunks and very dry. The pork was so chewy! And the Veg was 90% raw onion and cilantro. In fact the other two tacos were 50% fresh cilantro/raw onion and the rest of the ingredients were huddled in the bottom of each taco shell. The descriptions of each taco were wonderful but most of the ingredients were missing in what was served to us. I am not going to mention that the girl who prepared the tacos was not wearing gloves, but just grabbing that cilantro with bare hands. And right outside the entrance: a huge stinking garbage can! We saw two other groups of people come up to the restaurant, smell the rotting garbage, and leave. They were the smart ones!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-10T08:45:27-0400", "location_id": "10833542", "id": "416821928", "user": {"username": "Karen S", "user_location": {"name": "Charleston, South Carolina", "id": "54171"}}}]}
