The food is good, atmosphere awesome.  I really want to support the redevelopment of Santa Ana.  This was once a run down, dangerous neighborhood.  If you eat here, spare enough time to walk around the artist's colony and take a look at all of the buildings that have been restored.  The neighborhood comes to life, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-08-02T07:21:34-0400", "location_id": "754148", "id": "136054183", "user": {"username": "MasonsDad", "user_location": {"name": "Orange, California", "id": "32825"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-04", "title": "Great Lunch Spot", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33043-d754148-r129012228-m11068-Original_Mike_s-Santa_Ana_California.html#review129012228", "text": "This restaurant is very convenient to the OC courthouse and makes a great stop for lunch.

However, I was there this past weekend celebrating a birthday of a family member and im sad to say that My neice who was also there had $100.00 stolen out of her purse. Weve been here plenty of times and never had a problem like this and we always felt safe leaving our purses and things at our table when dancing and so forth. But, unfortunately this last time the money was taken and it was a very sad thing to have happen. What makes it even sadder is that in these types of situations there is no way to get the money back and thats really sad because this was all the money my neice had. I just want you to know that we dont hold it against the club at all, its just too bad that there are people amongst us who do such a terrible thing not thinking that their actions also reflects the club. So to whoever the sorry person was that did this, just remember that paybacks a b---- and what goes around comes around. Otherwise, we love Original MIkes and plan to go back again only we will be more catious next time.\nThankyou", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2010-04-02T02:42:00-0400", "location_id": "754148", "id": "60156724", "user": {"username": "gilz_10", "user_location": {"name": "lake forest, calif", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": null, "title": "Original Mikes; Restaurant or Gang Hang-out?", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33043-d754148-r46152090-m11068-Original_Mike_s-Santa_Ana_California.html#review46152090", "text": "First of all its filled with gang members over the entire weekend.  I went there to eat during the week and I had to be patted down and pass a metal detector wand test by a big fat bald guy who looked like he needed to be checked for weapons himself. I was thinking \"am i going into a restaurant or prison?\" \n\nOnce we got in its an ok looking place but our waitor got my order wrong. No big deal except for the fact that they brought me the correct order within a couple minutes. What do they got heat lamps back there?! Anyways the food was ok nothing to brag about. Second time I went there was for a night out with a few friends on a friday. \n\nBIG MISTAKE!! Again we had to be patted down, I thought \"what kind of people come here?\" Well I found out soon enough. The place was crawling with the local gang members. There is no dress code so it was pretty obvious.  They played 80's music and hip hop. I saw two fights break out at the same time! I had to get out of there so we went outside to chill on the patio.  Then we saw our third fight which was between a short stocky female security guard picking a fight with the female they were kicking out for fighting in the club! The sad part was the other securitys were letting their security friend beat up the girl. Then this guy came walking out and saw the fight between the girl and the female security and stepped in to break them up and the fat bald security guard grabbed him and chokes him with his arms, and  him, a white security guard and another security guard proceed to beat the crap out of him. After slamming him to the ground, the fat security guard gets up and starts another fight with another random guy that was walking out for no reason and beats him up too. \nWe saw the cops come and haul away they two guys that got beat up!! Seems like the fat secutiy guard and the rest of them should have been the ones  being hauled away.  Never going there again.\n\nA few days later my friend shows me an old OC Register clip online about a shooting that happened at Original Mikes. I dont know how they still have their doors open?? Well to make a long story longer, its filled with local gangsters, security gangs up and menaces their clientele, security themselves look like gangmembers like if they hired a local gang to look over the place. Scary if you ask me.  Wouldn't recomend it to anyone, unless you're good a dodging bullets.", "helpful_votes": "5", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2009-10-07T20:26:36-0400", "location_id": "754148", "id": "46152090", "user": {"username": "alonzo714", "user_location": {"name": "Orange", "id": null}}}]}
