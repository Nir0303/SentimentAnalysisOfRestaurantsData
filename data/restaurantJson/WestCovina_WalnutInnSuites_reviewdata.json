But I'll start by telling you about my experience. The only reason I stayed at the walnut was because I went to a music festival in the area and booked a hotel last minute so all of the others in the area were sold out already (and now I know why this one wasn't). The employees knew about the festival too, and maybe that was the reason they were so unpleasant and condescending when we checked in. I was graciously greeted by a \"what?\" from the lady at the front desk, which was just about the only word I could understand that she spoke because she had a very thick accent and was sitting behind a glass wall and didn't make any effort to stand up or get closer to the speaking hole. So after I finally got the room key (which looked about 7 years old and had an old brown sticker that used to be white with our room number on it), I walked to the room, with a glimmer of hope for the inside because the outside of the hotel looked somewhat newly remodeled so I was hoping the same for the room. WRONG. All of the furniture, carpet, bedspread, and pillows in the room looked like they had been there since the 70s and they all looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the 90s. There wasn't a single second in that room that I wasn't wearing sandals or socks. There was a hole in the wall and the nightstand had a huge chunk of wood broken off of it. I didn't even move the comforter on the bed a single inch because I was scared to see or touch the sheets. So I slept on top of the bed with one of my own towels as a blanket, and thank god I brought my own pillow. I even felt that the food I was eating was getting dirty by touching the air in that room and it made me lose my appetite. The bathroom was the cleanest part of the room because it looked ALMOST up to date and like maybe it had gotten cleaned recently. Still didn't take my shoes off tho. I'm so thankful I only booked this hotel one night because if I hadn't, I would have rather slept in my car after the second night of the festival. Do not stay at this hotel unless you enjoy still feeling dirty AFTER you shower.
