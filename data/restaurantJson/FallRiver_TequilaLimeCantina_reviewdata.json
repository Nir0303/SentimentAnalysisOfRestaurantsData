The steak tacos and the steak were cold and tasteless. \nThe only good thing about this restaurant was the server, she was very sweet and nice. I feel bad for her, because she didn't know what to say when we asked why are you guys charging for chips and salsa?

Love it!! The space is very old, which gives it so much character.  Bar is nice, multi-level dining adds interest and breaks up the space. Service was fast and friendly. Food was beautifully presented, fresh and delicious!  We had Blue Buffalo Burrito and Chicken Tacos. Both were huge (took 1/2 home). Indulged in the churros for dessert...can't wait to come back for dinner...and the home made Key Lime pie :)\n\nNote to management:  Would be wise to add some curtains or other textiles in the space -- the high ceilings and hard surfaces make the echoes a bit much to bear at times.  We were there for lunch, and the music was very loud.  I can imagine that it could get ear-piercing in there with a crowd at dinnertime.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-03T15:05:03-0400", "location_id": "4920176", "id": "306794058", "user": {"username": "Cheri O", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Not Tex-Mex, but you won't be disappointed", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41564-d4920176-r301229298-m11068-Tequila_Lime_Cantina-Fall_River_Massachusetts.html#review301229298", "text": "Good Mexican restaurants are few and far between in New England. This is one of the very good ones. The atmosphere at TLC is one of people enjoying their food and each other's company. The service is efficient and friendly, and we have never been rushed even on a busy night. The menu has many of the usual items you would expect at a typical Mexican restaurant, but the presentations are not necessarily traditional. If this will disappoint you, then find another non-chain Mexican restaurant if you can. If you are willing to be a little adventurous, you are likely to thoroughly enjoy your meal. My favorite is the fish tacos, only available on Fridays. The avocado fries appetizer is unusual but surprisingly addictive. You can customize your margarita with a selection of tequilas. There are no beers on tap, but a good selection of bottled Mexican and other beers. If you are looking for a place to have a lively meal with good food and good friends, this is the place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-19T12:28:42-0400", "location_id": "4920176", "id": "301229298", "user": {"username": "Marion A", "user_location": {"name": "Providence, Rhode Island", "id": "60946"}}}]}
