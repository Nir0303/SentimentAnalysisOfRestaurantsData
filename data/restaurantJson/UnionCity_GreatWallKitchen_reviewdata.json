We were happy that we were still within the lunch special prices (11am-3pm), which are actually a GREAT deal. For $6, you get your meal with rice and either soup or a soda can. My boyfriend got the sesame chicken with fried rice and wonton soup. Everything was just OK. It was all blah, nothing great. I had the steamed pork dumplings, my favorite thing everywhere, and less than impressed. The meat was bland and the sauce was weirdly sweet. I also had the spring rolls, which were nearly empty inside. Big disappointment.\n\nOn the plus side, they were very nice and quick. Everything was ready ahead of schedule and the counter people were nice, unlike many Chinese food places where they're rude. The prices were also good for everything and great for the lunch special. I will probably give it one more try, getting something else, and then move on to one of the other places on Stuyvesant. They do deliver but not to Kean University, according to their website.\n\nThe place is bigger than it looks on the outside, but is mostly a takeout place. They have 5-10 tables but it's not the sort of place you'd want to eat at unless you had no choice.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-03-17T11:47:33-0400", "location_id": "4718665", "id": "197753450", "user": {"username": "SheyJosie", "user_location": {"name": "Neshanic Station, New Jersey", "id": "46662"}}}]}
