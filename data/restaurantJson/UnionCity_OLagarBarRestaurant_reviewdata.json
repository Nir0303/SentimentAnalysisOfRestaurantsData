It wasn't nevertheless I decided to give it a try. This is what happened. \nMy wife called in for some reservations (thinking it was the restaurant on Route 22)   and they said they were packed but could squeeze us in.  We were happy. When we get there, it wasn't the restaurant we thought but we made the reservations so we decided to give it a try.\nWhen we walk it the place is empty, very strange expecially when they said they were packed. Anyway we proceded and the waiter who was taking care of us was very rude.  He practically threw the menu on the table and left.  He came back a short time later and asked if we were ready to order, I told him to give us a couple of minutes and he apparently didn't like that because he pretty much rolled his eyes and left.\nOk so finally he came back and we ordered.  The I ordered \"Carne alentajana\" which usally is a nice plate with pork and potatoes, my wife and daugther ordered Steak well done.\n\nWe didn't wait long and the food came out.  My wifes steak looked good but when she cut into it was still bleeding the same with my daugther.  My food was OK - for the amount of money I paid I expeceted something else\nso in Plain words - Food is ok and thats it.\nThis place is pricey.  My plate was $16 and usually its arond $13 - $14.  I don't mine paying for good food but this was just ok.  The service was not that great, the food was just OK and the prices were a little over priced.  I would not come here again unless I was starving and needed something to eat.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-04-22T17:50:14-0400", "location_id": "6022566", "id": "202326194", "user": {"username": "Robert C", "user_location": {"name": "Levittown, Pennsylvania", "id": "53023"}}}]}
