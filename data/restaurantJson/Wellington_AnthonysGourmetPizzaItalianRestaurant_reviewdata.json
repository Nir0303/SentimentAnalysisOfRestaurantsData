Luckily there is one within walking distance of our house. This year I got to enjoy it watching the Super bowl with a frosty Yuengling Lager. An unbeatable footlball game combo!\nPizza at Anthony's is always \"well done\" and the coal fire oven produces a nice char on the crust. My favorite topping is the Meatballs and Ricotta combination. I have tried to duplicate this with pizza places back home, but nobody does it quite like Anthony's.  Savory pork meatballs and generous dollops of Ricotta cheese top their crispy (yet chewy) crust and their tomato sauce is herby and delicious! Salads are pretty standard (but nice and fresh) and their wings have an interesting \"Mediterranean\"(?) spice profile (nothing like the Buffalo wings that are most common where I live) The arugula topping on the pizza is an interesting option and worth the extra $ if you are a fan. \nService is fast whether you eat in or takeout. Wish I had an Anthony's I could get to year round!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-23T08:19:25-0500", "location_id": "403990", "id": "350295055", "user": {"username": "Rick F", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "excellent choice of eatery", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34727-d403990-r333062216-m11068-Anthony_s_Gourmet_Pizza_Italian_Restaurant-Wellington_Florida.html#review333062216", "text": "The food is delicious but expensive.

The potential for a great experience has not been achieved.  A clean pub-like facility with a good selection of beers and wine.
