There were plenty of toppings and it was enjoyed. The Taquitos were very small and the filling was bland. The combination plate was large and very good. The fried tacos were fried flour tortillas (I expected corn) and were greasy. The tacos were good, but not what I had expected. I tried three of the sauces on the salsa bar (the non-neon green, the red and the chuncky). Some labeling on the bar would be helpful, as it is impossible to know spice level each one is.
