They also use lots of organic ingredients and offers gluten-free options.  They also do great espressos/lattes, offering suger-free and dairy-free options as well.  We ate excellent uma pork, fresh spinach salad with fresh strawberries and pineapple, and Mama's own potato salad.  Sizeable helpings and reasonable prices.  Co-owner, Danny came out and introduced himself and checked on how we were liking our food. He and his wife Jessica (bustling and smiling behind the counter) seem to be a very personable young couple. As a coffee house/food place, Manaia does not duplicate what's already in historic downtown Hillsboro and will be a great addition to it!

It's definitely a family friendly place, yet it is a large enough space that people seeking a little quiet with their coffee should also easily be able to find it.
