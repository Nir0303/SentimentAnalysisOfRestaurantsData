Turned a high ceiling location and made it feel \"smaller\" in a good way.  Only gripe was that there seemed to be some over serving going on, as there were at least 2-3 people blitzed.

And more and more bars, restaurants and such are jumping on the bandwagon.  Even if it is delivering on a classic cocktail like an Old Fashioned or deconstructing it, craft cocktails are as hot as craft beers and spirits.  And Distil is right in the thick of things.\n\nAnd they do it very well.\n\nWe hit Distil right when they opened at 5pm on a Saturday as we had sporting event to attend at 7pm.  So, we were the first, and only customer, for a bit.  I will say, by the time we left around 645pm, it had filled up nicely.  \n\nWalking in, you are greeted with a long, but narrow look and feel.  Not cramped, just a long look down the very cool bar.  Adorned with many bottles of spirits.  Don\u2019t even bother trying to \u201csee what they have.\u201d  The look and feel overall is great.  Especially the ceiling.  Service from the start was great.  The bartenders a sharp look with the vest, slightly rolled sleeves and tie.  Proper but not pretentious.  \n\nThe server was most helpful in describing the cocktails.  They also have a nice selection of beers.  Very few wine choices.\n\nWe had four of their signature cocktails.  All of them very well executed and unique.  From the Bourbon Sour to the Rosa Umada, Golden Rivalry and Pele\u2019s Antidote.  I would try any of those again and then some of the 10 or so other options.  We initially selected three and asked our server to bring his and the bartenders favorite two.  It made it a bit more fun.  While I am sure you can get a rum and coke, save that for the corner tavern.  Though I am sure their take on a rum and coke would be exceptional!!!\n\nAnd just as the cocktails were well prepared and presented, so was the food.   Plates, for the most part, are small enough for sharing.  So we had the cauliflower, cheese curds, chickpea fries and mushroom crostini.  Each came out as it was ready, which is what we requested.  Fresh flavors, great presentation, balance of taste and texture and smell.  Enticed all senses.  \n\nI would go back.  Sometimes a place like Distil might deliver on cocktails and come up short on food.  Or they may excel at food and come up short on their \u201cboutique\u201d cocktails.  In this case, they deliver on both.\n\nCheers to Distil.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "SURG_RestaurantGroup, Guest Relations Manager at Distil, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you SO much for taking the time to write this review!

My friend and I sat at the bar and the fellas working it were very laid back and easy to converse with. I had the bartender/mad scientist make me a whiskey drink, his favorite, and I ended up with a whiskey drink, my favorite. Only problem is I would have to hop on a plane to Milwaukee to get this expertly crafted cocktail again. We ended up eating food there, and the menu is limited for dinner dinner. A super rich and tasty burger was the only full meal option, but it was very good. We also split some cheese curds with ranch and I was really loving life. \n\nThis place is near the Marriott downtown in Milwaukee and would be a great stop off for a business traveler's nightcap or vacationers treat of apps and drinks.

First impression was great - lovely decor, with lots of wood and copper ceiling. My kind of atmosphere, dim but not dark, classy but still comfortable and not uptight. I would feel comfortable here whether dressed up for a night out or in jeans. Great place for a cocktail and conversation. There were a decent amount of people sitting at the bar, around 8pm, but we opted for one of the high backed booths. \n\nTo start, we ordered cheese curds and a couple beers. Beer list isn't huge but what they have is very good - seems very well curated, and dominated by Wisconsin brewed beer although they also had other crafts and imports. The cheese curds were fabulous and hit the spot. We decided to linger so we ordered another drink. They had a good selection of scotch and whiskey which made my husband very happy, and I had a hard time choosing from their cocktail menu. Nothing basic or using pre-made mixers here! These are cocktails the old fashioned way, complex and well balanced. I ordered a Bourbon Sour (from their menu - Elijah Craig 12Yr Bourbon, Lemon, Turbinado Sugar, Egg White, Bittercube Cherry Bark Vanilla Bitters, Angostura Bitters) and it was amazing (see attached photo) Our server was great, attentive without overdoing it and very friendly, though he told us he couldn't really help us with any questions on drinks, because he was underage, but that the bartender would be happy to come over if we needed him for anything. We would have stayed longer but we were already pretty wiped out so we didn't stick around. Not a huge food menu, but what they had looked great.

Distil is located at 722 N. Milwaukee Street, in downtown Milwaukee.  The street is like a \"restaurant row\" of sorts, and it was a bit difficult to locate the restaurant, as it was wedged between other restaurants and not clearly marked.  Nor was the building address visible to the casual passerby.  I believe Distil has valet parking, unless the parking guys were with other restaurants on the block.  \n\nDistil's interior was rather dark.  Very dark grained wood and a copper ceiling with baroque style crown moulding also in copper.  The restaurant is very long and narrow.  Estimated about 50 feet deep and under 20 feet wide.  The bar looked like it could seat 12 patrons.  There were high backed booths for 2 along one length of the wall, and seating for under 20 diners in the back of the house.  Our table was in the front of the house, which was very dark.  No window in that area, and the only window was in the main door.  The tables were elevated and the chairs were more like high bar stool type seating.  I found the seating a bit uncomfortable and just let my legs hang under the table.  We were greeted by our server, Kameron, who indicated he was a relatively new hire and not as familiar with the menu as a result.  He also could not provide much assistance where spirits and libations were concerned due to his not being 21 and couldn't sample them.  He did bring a bartender over to describe the drinks.  \n\nMy wife and I have patronized several restaurants in the SURG group and selected Distil because of our familiarity with the head chef there, Joe McCormick, who we have known since he was 5 years old.  Upon our arrival, we learned that Joe and the former pastry chef at Distil were in the Muskego area opening a new restaurant.  Obviously, the Distil web site needs severe updating, as it listed both Joe and the pastry chef as still working at Distil.  \n\nMy former co-worker ordered a \"Rotating Old Fashioned\" from the drink menu and liked it so much she ordered a second.  My wife drank a glass of house Riesling, and I ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, just to relive a few minutes of my college days back at WSU-Oshkosh in 1966.  Drinks were served without delay, as there were only around 6 other patrons in the restaurant at the 5:30pm time we arrived.  Distil's menu is more on the order of tapas, which I am not a fan of, as I like to eat, and eat mass quantities.  \n\nOur dinner order consisted of a number of Distil's offerings:  1) Cheese curds, consisting of Clock Shadow cheddar cheese curds, beer battered, and served with buttermilk ranch dressing.  A few of the cheese curds were overdone and crunched a bit more than they should have.  The order size was ample for 3 people, as each of us got 3 curds or so.  2) Bistecca Pizzaiola, consisting of tenderloin tips, hot Cappicola, and Pomadoro sauce.  For the uninitiated, almost everything from a pig can more or less be bacon.  Cappicola comes from the neck muscles to the 4th or 5th rib of the pig's shoulder.  It is often dry cured and used like a sandwich meat.  For our Bistecca, it was cooked and tasted a bit like bacon, without the intense salt rush one can get from bacon.  The steak serving was around 8-9 pieces, which would have made a better appetizer than a main dish.  But, the steak was good.  3) Smelt, which I ate alone.  Smelt are a family of small fish that often end up being eaten by larger fish.  They are caught by hand-netting them during their spawning runs.  They are headed and gutted, and often dipped in corn meal, and fried.  Such was the case at Distil.  I received a portion of around 20 smelt, which looked almost like an order of french fries.  They were served with tartar sauce and baked lemon.  I eat most foods plain, and did not use anything on the smelt.  A couple of them tasted \"fishy\", but they were good.  4)  Moroccan Cauliflower, consisting of cauliflower, parmesan batter, preserved lemon, and harissa.  The cauliflower was enjoyed by all and the parmesan batter was interesting, to say the least.  The dish was good.  5) Mushroom Crostini, consisting of shiitake, Crimini, and portobello mushrooms and tellegio on a toasted baguette.  The serving was 3 long pieces of baguette with mushrooms atop.  Personally, I find mushrooms to be one of the world's most disgusting food items and I'd rather starve than eat them.  The ladies at them and enjoyed the dish.  Last up was 6) Fresca Salad, consisting of mixed greens, fresh berries (strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries), goat cheese, candied walnuts, and poppy seed dressing.  Once again, the ladies shared the salad and thought it was a very inspired creation.  The amount of food we ordered would have likely been adequate for 2 people instead of the 3 of us, as all 3 of us like to eat.  \n\nWith dinner not really being enough, we elected to sample both of Distil's dessert options: 1) Rocky Road, consisting of walnut sponge cake, chocolate mousse, toasted marshmallows (which looked like whipped cream), chocolate covered pretzels, and marshmallow ice cream.  This was somewhat of a hodgepodge of ingredients that worked quite well together.  The chocolate covered pretzels were coarsely ground and spread on the plate near the ice cream and the marshmallow cream.  I wasn't sure what to make of the walnut sponge cake, as the chocolate mousse was mixed into the cake.  2) Belgian Waffle, consisting of a half of a Belgian waffle, fresh strawberries (which I ordered on the side.....I like fruit about as much as I like mushrooms), strawberry jam, opalys crisp (a version of French chocolate), and vanilla ice cream.  We found the waffle a bit overcooked and had to be careful when cutting it with a fork so that the piece wasn't launched across the room.  This dessert wasn't as intricate as the Rocky Road, but it was OK.  \n\nDinner, dessert, and drinks came to about $111.00 for the three of us, which was a bit pricey, but there was a fair amount of food for the money.  Kameron's service was good.  He paced the meal well, despite his newness to the facility and the menu.\n\nPROS: great food at decent prices for the \"tapas\" crowd; classy interior/ambience; intimate setting; food prepared quickly\n\nCONS: server was new and will only get better with time; music was a bit loud and conversations were hard to hear; lighting was subdued and made it difficult to read the menu; the craft cocktails' names were too long and too complicated of an ingredient list to deal with; web site needed updating, as neither chef listed on the site works in the restaurant.  \n\nOn the whole, however, one can't go wrong with the SURG group of restaurants.  We like them and you probably would too.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-20T19:39:50-0400", "location_id": "1991417", "id": "301680346", "user": {"username": "Stu T", "user_location": {"name": "Delafield, Wisconsin", "id": "59822"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Excellent Meal and Superb Cocktails", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60097-d1991417-r279148301-m11068-Distil-Milwaukee_Wisconsin.html#review279148301", "text": "We went to Distil for first time during Milwaukee's Downtown Dining Week.
