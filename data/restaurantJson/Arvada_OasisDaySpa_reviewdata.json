They were for the women in our family so they can go to the Oasis spa for Mother\u2019s day and receive services, particularly a social group manicure/pedicure, and spa packages they had there in the past. But, when the women tried to set up their appointments they found things have materially and substantially changed. For example, due to staffing shortages only two staff that can do nails at a time. \n\nAfter my stepdaughter called twice, and I called four times (5/23/2016, 5/24, 5/25 and 5/26), Brenda the owner did get in touch with me. The result is Oasis is unable to give services that women in our family have received in the past. They are also unwilling to give a refund of any kind. She stated a no refund policy on the website that I imagine is there, but was unable to find after scrutiny. I do now see a link to a refund policy on the actual gift certificates (after purchase).\n\nBrenda also said (to paraphrase) it was either too complicated or the mechanics did not exist to give a refund so we can go somewhere else. I\u2019m not sure I followed the line of reasoning here, but that was my attempt to communicate it. \n\nWhen I said I would be forced to contact the BBB, Yelp, and consider small claims court, she said this was OK, the no refund policy was clear on the website and her attorneys had thoroughly reviewed it.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-27T06:33:26-0400", "location_id": "6699678", "id": "377025884", "user": {"username": "AstroPinion", "user_location": {"name": "Lakewood, Colorado", "id": "33514"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Great mani/pedi service!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29140-d6699678-r365789088-m11068-Oasis_Day_Spa-Arvada_Colorado.html#review365789088", "text": "I would say don't miss the great care and service at Oasis.
