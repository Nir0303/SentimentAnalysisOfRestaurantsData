It's located on Garden Grove's Historic Main Street, a good place to hang out and talk with the other customers, and the folks walking by. I had a freshly built (and generous-sized) BLT with my coffee, and sat at one of the sidewalk tables. Coffee was good, BLT on multi-grain bread was tasty; a really good morning. Time to go back and try something else; the menu is on line, and makes you hungry just looking at it. Prices are really fair, especially considering the quality and quantity of their food. Great web site, too.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-12T21:13:48-0400", "location_id": "10837311", "id": "417769230", "user": {"username": "JohnMacMurray", "user_location": {"name": "La Habra, California", "id": "32576"}}}]}
