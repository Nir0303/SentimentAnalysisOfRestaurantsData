They allowed me (a female) to enter with a Florida ID but not my husband or friend who are both active duty Marine Corps with a military ID as well as out of state ID's.\n\nThis was also all done by a guy who insisted he was an active duty staff sergeant in the Marine Corps. Way to serve your brothers big guy...I'm glad you work for an establishment that discriminates.  I've posted pictures of the ABC liquor laws as well as the gentlemen who allowed my entry but refused my husband.\n\nAn update: a note was just sent to me saying we were denied service because we caused a scene. That is completely false.
