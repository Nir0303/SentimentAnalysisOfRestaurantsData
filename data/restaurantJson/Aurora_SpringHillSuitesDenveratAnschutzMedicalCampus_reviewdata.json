If you have been to other Springhill Suites you will know what to expect. This is a chain that puts a large meeting/breakfast area in the lobby, a small fitness room, and rooms that try to be hip but are not designed for the best use of the space. Check in was fast and friendly. The room, like all the others in the chain seem to be designed by dropping in a series of modules: desk, bed, bathroom, and a wardrobe. There is a sitting area and desk but the lighting is glaring and not very inviting. There is a little area with a coffee maker and fridge. There is a separate room for the toilet and a small sink. The shower (no tub) is very big with a large glass door. There is another sink across from the shower. The bed is big and comfortable but without outlets in bedside table. I can't believe that no one in this chain has ever stayed in one of these rooms and did not need to charge something. There is an outlet a few feet away from the bed. Another oversight is having a TV that does not face the bed. I guess they wanted it to be visible to the sitting area, but I bet most travelers watch the TV in bed. \n\nMy room faced Colfax which is a very busy road but I did not find any issue with noise. The drapes successfully blocked street light but the gap at the entrance door was so high the bright hall lights bothered me. Fixed it with a towel on the floor of the threshold. \n\nThe breakfast was standard motel fare but not very appealing the scrambled eggs were dry and in tiny little pieces, the sausage was flavorless. Every thing I tried cried out \"we're saving money over quality\". Stick with the cereal and fruit.\n\nThere is free parking behind the hotel but the lot got pretty crowded at times. This place was built recently in an area that is still under heavy development. Just behind that area is a pretty sketchy looking neighborhood so I would not recommend late night jogs out there. \n\nWould I stay there again? Yes because the price was better than the competition in the area and I could walk across the street (using the pedestrian overpass) to the hospital. It is a clean, slightly upgraded motel like those all across the USA.

I chose it primarily because it was a \"suite.\"  It was nice to have the extra sitting room and extra space, but there were some things about the room that I though were just odd.  For example, the lack of towel racks or even more than one hook!  There is one hook in the room with the toilet (for the hand towel) and one hook in the bathroom with the shower and sink.  Where are the other 3 people suppose to hang their towels.  This one hook was located too far from the shower to be able to reach it from the shower.  Am I the only one that likes to towel off in the shower or does everyone else just step out dripping wet?  It's crazy. Plus when we got to the room there was no towel in the \"water closet.\"  I guess they just forgot but maybe a housekeeping checklist would be a good thing.\n\nThe other thing we couldn't figure out was the refrigerator.  We had pizza delivered one night and brought home leftovers another night but the refrigerator didn't seem to keep things cold enough. Drinks were fine in there, but pizza was just a couple degrees south of room temp.  No matter what we did couldn't make it colder. \n\nThey were short on towels when we were there I guess, because they only left 2 towels in our room when we arrived, so I went down to the front desk to get some more.  There was a man there also wanting more towels for his room.  The person at the front desk said they were out of towels and wouldn't have any more until after housekeeping came in the morning to wash some.  She reminded us that this was not a \"full-service Marriott.\"  I did not realize that towels were just for \"full-service\" Marriotts.  \n\nBreakfast was so-so.  I read a review that said the oatmeal was delicious.  I wouldn't no because they were out of oatmeal all 4 mornings we were there.  Eggs weren't great, and the ham was also yuck.
