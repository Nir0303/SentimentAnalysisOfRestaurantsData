It's been awhile since we stopped by this location...but...did so for a quick lunch recently. We were in a bit of a time crunch and chose to use the drive-thru. I ordered a veggie burger...as I had many times before: GRILLED...not microwaved like they usually do [yuck!!]. I was told by the cashier that they don't grill them...so that wasn't possible. I attempted to explain that I've made this same request countless times and it's never been a problem. I realize the wait time is significantly longer for it to be cooked the right way versus 'warmed up' in a microwave...and...I'm totally cool with that. Yet...she wasn't budging. I asked to speak to a manager and a quite young-looking gentleman came to the window. I again asked him. He flat out told me: 'NO!'...with a smirk on his face. Wow! I asked about the man who had been the manager there forever and was told: 'He's gone now.' As you may have imagined...I decided to skip ordering altogether. I ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when I got home instead. The people I was with did still place an order. These too seemed hard to manage. A request for fries without salt went unheeded as they did have salt on them. A request for extra pickles on a sandwich also went ignored...just one teeny-tiny pickle on the side of the bun. The sandwiches looked flat and haphazardly thrown together...and had barely any condiments on them. It appeared none of us were pleased with either the experience or more importantly...the food. The attitude of the staff...especially the manager...is a guarantee I'll never return to this location. I truly feel he intentionally messed our order up just because he could. Abysmal customer service 'skills'...to say the least. Skip this dive and go to the Burger King location on 98th and Nicollet. They never question order modifications and the food is always right as requested. :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-07T11:24:37-0400", "location_id": "7345642", "id": "380633571", "user": {"username": "StarletteSkye", "user_location": {"name": "Murderapolis", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "No Complaints", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42881-d7345642-r325555468-m11068-Burger_King-Bloomington_Minnesota.html#review325555468", "text": "We've eaten here many times and have always had a pleasant experience. The food is cooked just as you request and tastes fresh and hot. The service is prompt and good with order correctness never being an issue. This goes for both dining inside or drive-thru service. The restaurant is a bit on the older side and could probably use some renovating...but it does always appear clean regardless. I appreciate that they still offer a true $1.00 menu. I also like that Burger King doesn't charge you for extra toppings or sauce sides...like some other burger chains do. It's the little things. My only suggestion is: don't be afraid to actually grill your veggie burgers. It may take a bit longer to prepare...but...the outcome is so much more delicious than microwaving them.
