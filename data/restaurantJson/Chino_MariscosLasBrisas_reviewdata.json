MISTAKE.\nIn hindsight I should have just ordered off the menu.\n\nI ordered 4 asada and 2 carnita with extra cilantro. The 6 white corn tacos were served in about 10 minutes. Had to order a soda though as that is required for daily specials (they have to make some $$).\n\nThe carnitas was moist and tender. Flavor was good but not anything to write home about. The asada was not good. Very dried out. No flavor at all. You'd think there would be some caramelized goodness... no. None. I tried the asada by itself to see what it tasted like without salsa, onions, lime and cilantro. Tasted like nothing. Just dried and chewy protein. Kind of like heavy banana-box-cardboard. Not the flavorful grilled flank steak you'd expect. This was very disappointing since I ordered 4 of them.\n\nNote: the cilantro was mostly chopped stems and imparted very little flavor.\n\nThe service was very fast and friendly.
