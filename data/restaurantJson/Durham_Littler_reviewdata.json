Service was great and small plates were really good.  The Beef Heart Tartare was awesome and the Short Rib Pastrami is one of these things I have ever eaten.  Space is very small and intimate, so you will probably want to grab a reservation or go really early.  Staff were all super friendly and very well educated on the food and cooking methods. We did not try any of the \"Supper\" options since we worked our way through many of the small plates.

It has a simple and sleek design, yet somehow still feels warm. We started with hand crafted cocktails that were refreshingly not so sweet. We shared four small plates and two entrees for three of us and that was perfect. \n\nThe arugula, fig and Parmesan salad was spectacular. But the standout of the night was the hanger steak, bone marrow flan with crispy vidalia onions. Knocked our socks off. The bone marrow flan was one of a kind and I would go back just for it. \n\nCan't wait to go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-18T09:44:20-0400", "location_id": "10756215", "id": "407121205", "user": {"username": "esemmes", "user_location": {"name": "Fiscardo, Greece", "id": "776022"}}}]}
