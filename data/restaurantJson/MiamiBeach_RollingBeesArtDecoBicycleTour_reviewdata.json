However, these should not be issues for a place that advertises it rents all these different kind of bikes and accessories!  We were just really disappointed to find that the attendant, the only person in the store, had absolutely zero clue as to how to attach the bicycle trailer and he also did not really seem to know much about any maps that the store had for self -tours, also as advertised on web site.  Because he could not put on the trailer, we left and went next door and took the 4 PM Duck Boat tour instead.
