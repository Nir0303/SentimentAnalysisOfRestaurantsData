Our server, Becky K, started us off on a bad note. We were sitting outside on the patio. It was a beautiful night and we were the only people outside. We were greeted in a mostly efficient manner, but our server did not introduce herself or ask how our night was going. She first says, \"What can I get you to drink?\" I don't think that's a friendly greeting at all. Granted, we didn't come out last night seeking to have stellar service, but when we dine out it's usually a pleasant experience, and the server is a huge part of that. We noticed on the menu they had the fun pop machine where you can choose your soda and syrup. I asked if Diet Caffeine Free Coke was available, our server said yes, so I ordered one with cherry syrup, as well as a water. She returned shortly with my husband's drink, and a pink drink for me. There was no Coke of any kind in my glass, and we determined that it was just straight cherry syrup. I did not receive a water. She took our order and left, and I eventually decided to go up to the host stand to get a new beverage. A different server, Nicole, told me that they did not carry Diet Caffeine Free Coke and so I instead just asked for the water that I did not receive, and for Nicole to please make sure I wasn't charged for the soda. I went up to the host stand again about 10 minutes later, as we were not brought or offered refills by our server. I kindly asked the host for refills. She was friendly enough and helped me out by telling me where the restroom was. I thought the cleanliness of the restroom was very poor for a restaurant. The floors were dirty and sticky, and a soap dispenser and a paper towel dispenser were empty. Nicole is the one who brought us a caddy of supplies, checked on us during our meal, and ended up taking care of our payment. The food was excellent, although the fry portion with my burger was quite small. I'm in the hospitality industry myself and I understand sometimes you get super busy, but the restaurant was relatively slow. I also understand how we might have been an inconvenience by being the only people dining outside, but a guest should never be made to feel that they are a nuisance to the server or restaurant. The food was great tasting and I thank Nicole for being helpful to us even though it was still Becky's name on our receipts at the end of our meal, so I can only assume Becky never transferred us to Nicole. What really rubbed us the wrong way was the unfriendliness of the server, the fact that we always had to be the ones to initiate our refills, and the fact that she lied about Diet Caffeine Free Coke. I can understand not being sure, but I would appreciate honesty or a simple \"Let me check for you.\" I'm sure we seemed like a super needy and annoying table, but it is only because we were receiving extremely poor service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Millie G, General Manager at Green Mill, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you, Erin, for taking the time to leave us a review.

Food on the carpet and on our booth. Dirty silverware. Men's bathroom wasn't any better. This location seems to be attached to a hotel, and it looks like it gets a LOT of foot traffic. Our server was fine - not impolite, but not exceptional either. Moderately attentive. The food tasted decent, but the lack of cleanliness everywhere weighed on my mind - I didn't want to think about what the kitchen looked like.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Millie G, Guest Relations Manager at Green Mill, responded to this review", "text": "Hi Jdawgm13, \nThank you for taking the time to leave us a review.
