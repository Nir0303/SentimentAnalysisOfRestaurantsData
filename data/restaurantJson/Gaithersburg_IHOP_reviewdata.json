Making a reservation helps a bit. we were seated and the hostess was kind. The food took awhile to get to us, which is something that can be improved. The food was typical fare.

They will give you the bill, while you are eating, and say this is just for your convenience and please take your time. Their actions betray their words. I'm not just picking on this branch but every time I've been to IHOP this year (3x) this has happened. It must be the way they are trained. That is my gripe with IHOP. Anyway, the food was typical.
