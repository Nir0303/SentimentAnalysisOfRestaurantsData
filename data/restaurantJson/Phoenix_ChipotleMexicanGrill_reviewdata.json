We caught them just before closing and the place was still filled with patrons. There was no rush and the preparer was very helpful and patient with my wife as she had not been to a Chipotle's before. Of course they had to ready for closing but the staff at this store allowed the customers to comfortably finish up their visit. At the end of the day, the binned ingredients were still in good shape. Though not perfect, I had no concerns about the overall quality and taste. Baja Fresh is in the same fast casual Mexican space as Chipotle and does win the salsa comparison but I like the customer customized preparation (a la Subway) that Chipotle uses. The portions are plentiful; we snacked on one order and still had leftovers for breakfast. The only real minus was that there was a bit of stuff on the floor, though at the end of the day, this was minor.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2012-02-04T20:21:12-0500", "location_id": "794568", "id": "124138313", "user": {"username": "IchiroK", "user_location": {"name": "Klamath Falls, Oregon", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2011-06", "title": "CHIPOTLE; WORTH THE TRIP!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d794568-r113221390-m11068-Chipotle_Mexican_Grill-Phoenix_Arizona.html#review113221390", "text": "I was a first time visitor to Chipotle in June 2011.
