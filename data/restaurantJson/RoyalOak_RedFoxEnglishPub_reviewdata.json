Some of our favorite foods were French Onion Soup Dumplings, the fresh potato crisps with blue cheese & bacon bits, and they had particular meat specials certain days.  Saturday was Short Ribs in several dishes, such as their artisan grilled cheese with short ribs, or short rib dinner.  They also had a nice Roast Beef with Yorkshire pudding.  A favorite side was the very skinny shoestring fries---delicious!  All these dishes----GONE!  A new menu was unveiled last week.  Many of our favorite tap beers (Atwater Vanilla Java Porter & Speckled Hen---GONE.  Our waitress said they still had as many kinds of beer on tap as previously, but we would swear this was not true.  We have had many food mis-haps here from the kitchen as well, oops, they dropped it, they over-cooked it and it's being re-made.  We waited 50 minutes on this occasion to get our food.  Our service was good and also friendly, but there are too many other dependably good choices in Royal Oak or nearby Ferndale for a very good meal.  The view alone is not worth it.  Unless they just want you to hang out on the terrace & drink, then go down the street to eat.  There were many, many, empty tables inside on what should have been a busy Saturday evening on a beautiful day.  Disappointed & probably will dine elsewhere.  Incidentally; our server told us the shoestring fries were still available at their other restaurant downstairs.  The Mexican restaurant?

Our server, John, was great with suggestions and service.  I ordered the broiled whitefish with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach and got a Woodward salad on the side that came with a tomato dressing.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food.  My husband ordered their Shepherd's pie which came with balsamic glazed roasted brussel sprouts.  His was also very good. The only downside was that it felt cold inside (temperature, not atmosphere) and one of the employees opened the doors right by us (even after I asked her to sit us somewhere warm) to go outside despite the fact that it was maybe 40 degrees outside and nobody was outside.  Had a hard time warming back up after that.  But, I'd go back again for a date night if I'm in Royal Oak.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-11-15T04:41:03-0500", "location_id": "3365929", "id": "184773914", "user": {"username": "Nelleigh", "user_location": {"name": "Clarkston, MI", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great Roof-Top Bar", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d3365929-r180408898-m11068-Red_Fox_English_Pub-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review180408898", "text": "I have been here a few times in He last few months.
