The bare brick walls, exposed ducts and open rafters foretold the oh so typical hipster eating establishment.  \nWe were wrong; it was an dinning delight.  \nWe split their bib lettuces, blue cheese and bacon salad to start.  The house made dressing was creamy and the cheese flavor apparent but not overwhelming.  It's hard to wow me with a salad but this one was excellent and could have been my whole meal on an \"eating light\" day.  I had their chicken over collard greens, cubed potatoes, and baby organic carrots.  The flavors were a fall feast, the ingredients were first rate and the presentation was sublime.  A nearly perfect chicken dish, that's hard to do, but they pulled it off.  My wife had the steak sandwich with jalape\u00f1o  aioli.  The meat was perfectly prepared and the aioli was mainly flavor and only a little heat.  It was excellent.  \nWe finished with there seasonal sweet potato cheese cake.  It tasted like the first Thanksgiving would have tasted if the pilgrims had known anything about cheese cake.  The crust was a gluten free minced nuts and sugar combination.  I'm not gluten free but the crust shows how creative and clever pastry chefs have embraced this customer segment.  Great flavor and texture!  The cheese cake was light and gently flavored with sweet potato, more pumpkin-ish and nutmeg-ish than yam-ish.  Absolutely delicious.\nOur waiter was quick and efficient and the manager was by twice to check on our selection and to discuss their focus on the best of the best of the season.  She was a wealth of information and a delight\nPark in the back, there are lots of spaces.\n\nBTW-For those of you who didn't watch HBO's Big Love series, the head line is a quote from the Lois character.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-07T11:59:09-0500", "location_id": "7110433", "id": "435441262", "user": {"username": "Dbd630", "user_location": {"name": "Chicago, Illinois", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "A Gem in Alpharetta ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29196-d7110433-r435203286-m11068-South_Main_Kitchen-Alpharetta_Georgia.html#review435203286", "text": "Just ate at South Main Kitchen in Alpharetta, Georgia.

I think I would enjoy dining there again whenever I am in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-20T07:40:28-0400", "location_id": "7110433", "id": "407890766", "user": {"username": "Jan B", "user_location": {"name": "Cumming, Georgia", "id": "34877"}}}]}
