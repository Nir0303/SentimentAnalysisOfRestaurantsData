However, after almost 12 hours have gone by I still feel exactly the same way. So here is my Yelp review...\nI hate that the Gaithersburg location which is the closest to us, has such horrible, sad, apathetic people working it. The so called \"manager\" Kenny is the worst, most sad human being in the entire universe. He is rude and I highly dislike him. My office finds it convenient to call and order here because they deliver. Unfortunate for me this person is the one who always answered the phone, I can remember his dark gloomy voice because he sounds so unhappy. Today our order took over a hour and we are still currently waiting. I called twice to ask where our food is and they did not care, we order food every week here and we will never order from this place again, the food is not good enough for for us to accept being treated as this person treats you. Now I understand why their location is empty all the time.\n\nI am not asking you for free food Pollo Rico, I am paying you for a service and you are not delivering..", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-02-06T19:35:42-0500", "location_id": "4102950", "id": "252978745", "user": {"username": "Cristine C", "user_location": {"name": "Olney, Maryland", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Authentic Peruvian Chicken!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41154-d4102950-r247924210-m11068-El_Pollo_Rico-Gaithersburg_Maryland.html#review247924210", "text": "El Pollo Rico is definitely rico!

The chicken is always moist and cooked to perfection with the delicious smokiness of the real a-la-brasa cooking (not just doused in liquid smoke, which I have found other places - ick).
