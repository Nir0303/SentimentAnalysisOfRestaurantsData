I'm always greeted by smiling energetic staff. It's a bit unnerving at first as it's pretty well a new concept and you don't know what you want the first time in. Staff does a real nice job directing you to something you are going to enjoy. Personal favorite for me is the mac and cheese, also have enjoyed the Pad Thai. The owner Chad is often in there greeting customers and has even called after a delivery before to make sure everything was exactly as I would have expected. Delivery on bikes is really cool. Awesome fast casual pasta place.
