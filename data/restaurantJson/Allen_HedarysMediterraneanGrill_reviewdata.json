While looking in Trip Advisor - we found \" Hedary's Mediterranean Grill\" listed in nearby Allen and decided to give it a try.  It was a short drive from the Sheraton and we easily found the pink house like structure housing the restaurant, There was a nice garden outside, where fresh herbs, tomatoes, squash, zucchini etc was growing. We were warmly greeted by Betty, who seated us in one of the many small dining rooms.  We decided to try the \"Mezza\" platter - which had about 20 small dishes of just about every type of Middle Eastern  dip and appetizer imaginable.  A large bowl of fantastic home made bread was also brought to the table.  This was way more than I expected, and was much more than enough for the 4 of us. As for the main courses, we had Kibbee - 2 stuffed meatballs served with a very aromatic rice, plus grilled tomatoes. Son ordered a combination meat plate that featured large portions of beef, lamb, chicken vegetables and rice served in a kabob style. He gave it 5 stars.  Grandson ordered a mediteranean pizza with cheese, fresh, basil and tomatoes. He said was the best he had ever had.  Forgot he also ordered a mozzarella, tomato and fresh basil salad, which was like a Caprese Salad and he ate it all.  I ordered the Hedary Special Chicken platter - a half chicken, perfectly grilled and and served in a creamy lemon based sauce with roasted potatoes, sweet potatoes and some other vegetables I am was not familiar with, but were outstanding. Everyone except me ordered iced tea, which they said was fine, I ordered Turkish coffee - kind of like an expresso, and it was ok - nothing special  No alcohol is served at the restaurant, but I saw people bringing in their own wine.  I very much recommend this restaurant for its food quality, decor, ambience and extremely friendly and attentive service. Can't wait to go again. Thanks, Betty, chef and management for a wonderful meal.

Well, the next year, my son announced his engagement so I planned a pre-wedding dinner in one of the rooms at Hedary's.  I was a little nervous because many members of my family are world travelers  and discriminating gourmets but they raved about Hedary's food and said that it was the best they had ever had!  Whenever someone asks me where to dine in the area, I recommend Hedary's.  The owner is always there, as is a personable waiter that we like. The pocket bread is made after the diners arrive and is placed on the table warm from the oven; it is irresistible!  This is a long post to say that I highly recommend Hedary's; it is my favorite area restaurant. Last week I brought co-workers to the restaurant and they were so pleased!
