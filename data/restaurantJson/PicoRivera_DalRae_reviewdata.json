The Wait Staff was all dressed in black and white and our waitress arrived in seconds with a delicious relish tray and bread selection.  She explained the menu and took our drink orders.  When she returned with our drinks, we asked a few questions about the menu selections, and my wife chose the Signature Peppered Steak  while I selected the Chilean Sea Bass.  For starters, we selected the \"Original Caesar Salad\", which was prepared at our table by the Matre'd.  Nectar of the Gods.  The Waitress kept track of our progress on the salad and placed our order to arrive at the perfect temperature along with our baked potatoes and asparagus.

It is definitely a \"special occasion\" restaurant in regards to the style of food, prices, etc., but the prices are fair (I have spend as much and often more at other high-end restaurants).\n\nWe last dined at Dal Rae for our anniversary in July 2016. As another reviewer mentioned, reservations are essential. A couple of slightly sourer notes when we first arrived. We intentionally arrived 30 minutes prior to our reservation so that we could enjoy a cocktail in the bar (a Martini or Manhattan is a good cocktail choice befitting the ambiance). We checked in at the front desk and told them we were early so that we could have a drink in the bar. We were handed one of those beep and light up things like you might get at a mid-level chain restaurant that doesn't take reservations. You know what I mean - you go to PF Changs, put your name in, and they hand you the device - when it goes off, your table is ready. I don't mind the devices in that situation, but it seemed really weird at a restaurant like Dal Rae when we already had reservations.\n\nThe second off note was that, just moments after we sat down in the bar (still roughly 30 minutes until our reservation), the device went off. When my husband went to the front desk to mention that our reservation wasn't for 30 minutes, the woman at the front desk was rather curt and told him \" you requested a booth and one is available now - if you don't take it, you'll have to take a regular table or wait longer after your reservation time until another booth is available.\" As this was our anniversary, we really wanted to stick with the plan - drink in the bar, a leather booth for dinner - so we said we'd wait until the next booth was available.\n\nAs it turned out, I think we waited in the bar roughly 30 minutes after our original reservation time, but that was OK. When our buzzer went off again and we went to the front desk, the woman was much more pleasant and apologized for the wait. We were seated in a lovely booth, and the rest of the evening went well.\n\nWe wanted the true \"old school\" experience, so we planned our dinner accordingly. We started with Oysters Rockefeller, followed by tableside Caesar Salad and Chateaubriand for two. Warning - depending on the location of your table and how crowded it is, \"tableside\" items (such as the Caesar Salad and Chateaubriand) are sometimes prepared away from your table, out of sight (such as in the bar) - which, while the food still tastes just as good, doesn't give you the fun experience of watching the preparation. Make sure you ask when ordering a tableside item if it will truly be tableside.\n\nAll of the food was wonderful. We made sure that the Caesar Salad and Chateaubriand would both be truly tableside. The Caesar Salad was especially good - most Caesar Salads that you get these days, even in high end restaurants, used pre-made dressing that just aren't as good. The Caesar Salad at Dal Rae is completely from scratch - coddled egg, anchovy paste, parmesan, garlic, olive oil - the entire dressing is made right there in front of you before being tossed with the romaine and croutons.\n\nWith the Chateaubriand, it is carved tableside and then plated along with potatoes and vegetables, and served with Bearnaise Sauce. A nice show, and so good! \n\nWe ended our meal with a Grand Marnier Souffle, served with creme anglaise - again, one of those items you don't see much anymore, but one of our favorites. It was the perfect end to our dinner.\n\nWith the exception of the initial curtness of the front desk woman, service was impeccable. Friendly but not overly-friendly (I hate the recent trend of servers trying to act like your best friend), professional - everything you'd want in a fine dining restaurant.\n\nI love Dal Rae and hope it sticks around for another 50 years.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-23T09:35:11-0400", "location_id": "341595", "id": "421519294", "user": {"username": "Lynda V", "user_location": {"name": "Long Beach, California", "id": "32648"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Step back in time to a REAL Old School restaurant with Amazing Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32879-d341595-r411888502-m11068-Dal_Rae-Pico_Rivera_California.html#review411888502", "text": "Had a friend take us here for dinner.

Dal Rae is known for their complimentary pickle selection, but despite a request for more. only one small bowl was provided for a party of six. Then an order of duck was so poorly prepared that it had to be sent back and replaced.

All impeccably served, and all with tastes to melt in your mouth.  Their fillets and peppered steaks are unequaled, and the lobster thermadour is the most delicious dish I have ever had.  Even if you want to just stop in for a romantic drink and listen to the music (sometimes live entertainment) in their cozy bar, you will not be disappointed.

I noticed the parking lot was always jam packed and when a vendor came to town I noticed that the yelp reviews were great so we decided to check it out. The quality of the food was great; the caesar salad is prepared table side and they allow for some options on the preparation of the dressing (I don't care for Anchovies). I had the bone in ribeye and my wife got the parmesan and onion crusted salmon. I don't know if they age their own beef but the flavor was great and the meat was tender and cooked to my liking (Medium Rare). Topped with some mushrooms and onions I salted and peppered to my liking, no steak sauce needed. I took a bite of my wife's salmon and it was sumptuous. The parmesan and onions added to the richness that paired well with my house red wine. The price is a bit steep, but my wife and I will be coming back for a few special occasions, I am sure.
