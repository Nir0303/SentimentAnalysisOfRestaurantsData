Please check their  website and their picture gallery will make you wanting to go there.  But in real it's the cheapest repetitive  sushi that u can get. Some busineses know how to lure people in. Regular china buffet  have better taste of sushi than this restaurant.  We had all u can eat for $21.00 per person. Maybe if you buy regular  priced sushi they will make it better, I don't know. Most of it is rice, barely any filling. Come one we didnt came in to eat rice and simple sushi. If your profession is sushi than make it apealing and tasty. People rather eat less sushi but quality. Trust me my sushi that I  make at home is much better, fansier, and at least have some taste  to it and decor. The serving plates that they bring sushi on is not appealing. Also you have to eat from a kid size plate, it's unbelievable. Server brought about  2 teaspoons of spicy mayo, when you dip few times it's gone and on their menu it says you have to pay a $1 for extra sauce if you ask again. I've asked server is that all what we get?, she said\" yes, that's a free one and than you'll have to pay $1, but I told her that there is barely  any sauce  to begin with, u can see a plate trough it. Also I told server that I don't like your sushi, It has no taste to it and she replied: \"you are eating it because it's just  there?\" No apologies, didn't ask what they can do to make it better. Customer  service  is terrible.

Yes, the menu could be a bit confusing in that it says \"included\" for several items, but that does not mean they waste food by automatically putting it out.  You have to ask for it just like you do for the rolls and nigari (have seen other all you can eat places that do the same in other states).  Not a reason to down check a place when you just had to ask.\n\nDaughter, wife and me for daughter's B-day lunch, Wednesday at 11:30 AM.  Wife had the shrimp bento box for about $13, daughter and I had the AYCES for $15 each.\n \nI  took half a dot off because there is a better sushi place within 10 miles, but it is not all you can eat, more expensive, and I think Tony's is a bit friendlier.  I took another half dot off because the rolls (lunch menu) are semi-repetitive compared to another location about five miles away (all you can eat) but Tony's is cleaner and has better quality control. Over all I rate Tony's (for lunch) at 4.5. \n\nReading some other reviews on other sites, if you do eat here, realize that the term SUSHI comes from one of the main ingredients, cooked vinegared rice or sushi-meshi.  If you just want the toppings, then you need to order SASHIMI, which is a LOT more expensive.\n\nOverall our rolls, soup, and nigari were very good, the vegetable tempura was above average, and the crab rangoon was good too.  \n\nThe wife liked her bento box, but had to give us some of her stuff because she could not eat it all.\n\nThe wait staff was one older Asian and one young Anglo, both were good at keeping us up to date and eating.  There were tables of one single, two, seven, and four, plus our three and it looked like we were all kept satisfied.\n\nValue, that is very subjective.  It has been some time since I ate AYCES elsewhere, so I may be a bit off (especially with the economy issues), but I would say 4.5 rounded down.\n\nWhen I want to sushi out, this is my first choice in the Layton, Utah area.\n\nOh, and I marked \"Is this one of the best meals you've ever had in a restaurant?\" as no.  The best AYCES (with many other American and Asian items) was a semi-true Japanese style all you could eat restaurant in Escondido, California back in 2002 (since closed).

They are not the highest quality sushi, but provide a good basic selection and good quality at a very reasonable price. What takes their restaurant from good to great is Caesar and Tony. They are very friendly and funny and work diligently to ensure that their customers have a wonderful experience. We visit this establishment monthly and often multiple times per month.

We ordered the AYCE sushi dinner.  We were seated right away and got our drinks and appetizers.  We waited a long time for our food and when it finally came our order was incomplete (we never got a roll so we ordered it again).  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our second order of one roll.  We had to flag other waitresses down to get drink refills or other items. All the rolls had too much mayo in them.  The sushi was not good and the service was bad.  It cost over $50 and we felt robbed.

I think the sushi is all we really go there for so I can't really tell ya how their dishes are but the sushi is so awesome. All-you-can-eat for $15 each. I recommend it to a lot of family & friends. Their service isn't the best because they only have a few severs but I don't really care about that. The servers I think are the owners tony and his wife and they are waaay nice!! I recommend the sunrise or sunset sushi.
