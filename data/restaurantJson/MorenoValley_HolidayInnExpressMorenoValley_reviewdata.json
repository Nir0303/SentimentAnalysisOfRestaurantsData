There's a reason they are changing and that's because it's falling way below standards.  My two highlights were a shower that barely had water coming out of it and a bad smelling room.  As a non-smoker, I can tell when a room use to be smoking.  This was definitely one of those rooms and the front desk admitted to me that it use to be one.  Since I have allergies and smoke is one of them, I could tell right away.  Basically, they just tried cleaning a smoking room and calling it non-smoking.  So, if you're expecting the room to be non-smoking, make sure you specify that (even though I always do).\nYes, they changed my room or I would have checked out and gone somewhere else.

My only negative would be no room service but there are plenty of eateries nearby. Location is right off the freeway, The 1st floor room I got was facing the freeway and still very quiet inside the room.  Plenty of free parking.  There's a bowling alley right next door, but I didn't get to check it out.  Front desk staff were very kind and fast.  Hotel has a gym that looked decent.  The king studio was quite spacious.  The bathroom was small but had everything you need, including hair dryer. Towels were soft.  Room was nicely decorated.  Bathroom even had a fan which you don't see in every hotel.  Room had microwave and fridge.  Bed and pillows were comfortable.  This room had a long couch which was nice.  All in all, a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend.  Only reason I gave 4 stars was because of no room service.
