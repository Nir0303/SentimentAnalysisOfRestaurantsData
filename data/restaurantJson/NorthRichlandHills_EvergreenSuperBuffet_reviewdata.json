Anytime you mix Chinese with Mexican and seafood and American desserts.... and put it on a buffet line to lose what little taste there was at first.. Some of this food just could not be eaten after a first bite. We ate at about 12:30... in the prime time of the day so you would suppose the food would be somewhat fresh. Wrong...! It seemed more like it was fresh the day before. There are plenty of other dining options around this area. Choose one of the other ones.
