I am puzzled by your heat and water issues. The heat control is at the door to your suite in the room in which you stayed. And it's working well. In fact, it's a brand new unit as of this summer. Maybe you weren't given instructions on how to adjust it? There's also a brand new hot water heater. I haven't had this complaint before or since about the water, not to minimize your discomfort at all, but I am very surprised at your feedback. The television, also brand new was on the wrong channel, on the tv itself. All you had to do was just change the channel on the tv to get a clear picture. It's a shame that you didn't ask us while you were here. We certainly would have helped you in any way, moving you to another room if necessary to make you comfortable. Our goal is to welcome the world as strangers, hoping they leave as satisfied and soon-to-return friends.
