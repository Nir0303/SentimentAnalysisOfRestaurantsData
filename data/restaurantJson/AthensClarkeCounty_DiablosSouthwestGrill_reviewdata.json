I was lucky to win a gift card, honestly with the resto's name, this will not be M & I's first choice of resto :D\n\nAnyway, we are lazy to cook lunch so we decided to use the $25 gift card today. I actually thought that it's a sitdown resto, instead you have to fall in line and give your order. I was not disappointed because I like that I can ask the server what they have and get my food right away.\n\nYou have a choice of burrito, 3 tacos, burrito bowl, salad or nachos. You have to choose the meat you want, they have steak, chicken, pork and ground/chopped beef. They also have tofu and veggie option. And then the rest of the toppings. I ordered a salad with black beans, steak, picadillo, olives, fresh jalape\u00f1os, lettuce, cheese and spicy salsa ($7.45). M ordered chicken burrito ($7.45) (see picture) not sure what's inside :) and I ordered a nacho plate with pork meat, lettuce, jalape\u00f1os, different kinds of cheese, spicy sour cream (really yummy!)($7.45) and a cup of guacamole, for an extra charge of $3+, it's a lot so we brought the leftover guacamole home too and we got 2 regular drinks for $1.85 each. Needless to say I used all of the $25 limit and pay the excess of $7.69 :D\n\nThat explains why we have to get a to go box for M's burrito, we were so FULL! :) All orders comes with a serving of nachos. I am not sure if I am crazy about the nacho chips, they are thin, so when they poured the cheese sauce they got saggy and they break easily (guess that was my fault :)) \n\nThe service is quite slow, which is understandable, cause it's a new place and I guess some of the customers are not familiar on how to order. I think the crew on the counter are still learning the process too, the cashier seem to not know the menu yet, but I understand that, like I said it's a new place :)\n\nIt can sit probably about 30-40 people. There is the \"best seat in the house\" which M wanted to try but, we were too hungry to goof around :) look for that seat :) \n\nThe Manager (which I think is actually the owner) is very friendly and interacts with the customers. He is hands on, when the soda machine had some issues, he immediately addressed and tried to fix it. \n\nOh, btw, don't worry about getting extra salsa cause they have a station for individually packed salsas (green & red, mild & spicy).\n\nI recommend this place for those that wants to get their money's worth. For $10, you will have a complete meal. The location is perfect if you want to shop, see a movie and then eat! :) it is conveniently located at the new shopping place at the Oconee Connector.
