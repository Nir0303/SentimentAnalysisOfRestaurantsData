Because of my experience I'll never eat at another Dickies ever again. I walked in and waited 10 minutes to order a rib plate and was told by Nick that they were out of ribs, but, a new batch of ribs would be done in 30 minutes. I went to my car and waited. When I returned Nick and Brianna then said they would not have any ribs for the rest of the night and it was 6pm. How does a BBQ Pit NOT have ribs at dinner time!?! I then ordered the brisket. When I checked the order before I left, I saw that the brisket was thrown into the carry out container and a complete mess. I refunded the order and poor Brianna didn't know how to operate the register. An hour later and I'm hungry and empty handed. While I waited and waited for nothing, I noticed that the food prep area was a complete mess! I also noticed that several people left because service was so slow. I then drove to Bakers Ribs and had a rib platter within 6 minutes via their drive-thru. If I ever return to Dallas, I won't  return to Dickies!
