Right as you sit, chips & salsa come automatically to the table -- which I love beyond words (most modern Mexican eateries are too fancy for this staple of the meal and tend to make your order it separately).  The salsa here is flavorful and fresh, and the guac is just right.  Chips come nice and hot out of the fryer.  \n\nThe main menu itself is laid out into app's, a la carte options, and combination plates.  I usually wind up going a la carte, so I can create a huge plate of four or five different items (some Mex restaurants call this the \"El Presidente\" plate).  The hard tacos were bigger than anticipated and extra crunchy.  The shredded beef enchiladas were super cheesy (in a good way) and served \"wet style\" with the red sauce baked in.  And the chicken taquitos were crispy on the outside and perfectly soft & moist on the inside. The rice is subtly flavored and does not have vegetables mixed in.  \n\nI can't speak to the beans as I was too full at this point to sample them.  They looked great though with the white crumbly cheese sprinkled on top! \n\nMargaritas were a tad watered down, but the food more than made up for it! \n\nI have to give my compliments to the staff who were all pleasant and more than happy to welcome a party of tourists like ours and treat us as if we were regulars.        \n\nNow, I've read some other reviews on here complaining about the prices and I have to disagree.  This is a perfectly affordable place with great-tasting food.  I think we paid less than 50 bucks for two of us -- and that was with margaritas, app's and entrees, and tip all rolled into one.\n\nI don't know when I'll be back in Arcadia, but the next time I do, I'll most definitely be stopping by Peppers top say \"Hola\" and eat 'til my heart's content.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-09-28T12:03:19-0400", "location_id": "510001", "id": "314464549", "user": {"username": "Matt G", "user_location": {"name": "Brooklyn, New York", "id": "60827"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Needs to Re-Energize", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29105-d510001-r309692077-m11068-Peppers_Mexican_Restaurant-Arcadia_California.html#review309692077", "text": "Not long ago, Peppers was far and away the best Mexican restaurant in this part of the San Gabriel Valley.
