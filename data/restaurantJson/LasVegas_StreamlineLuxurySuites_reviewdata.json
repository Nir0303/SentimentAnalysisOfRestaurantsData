This is not actually a hotel; it's a beautiful new tower in downtown Las Vegas which features luxurious and spacious 1, 2, and 3 bedroom condos available for short- and long-term rental. To be honest, I did not stay there this past trip, but we were given a lengthy tour by a super friendly woman named Sherrell. We viewed several rooms, and all were lavishly appointed complete with multiple HD flat-screen TV's, gourmet kitchens, and spectacular views of the Las Vegas skyline.\n\nWe also toured the pool and hot tub deck, located near the top of the building, and although the pool is a bit on the small side, it would certainly be more than sufficient to give you a respite from the sometimes oppressive Las Vegas heat.  The fitness center is terrific, comprising several nearly new, top-of-the-line Precor machines. \n\nThe Streamline Tower is located on Las Vegas Blvd, only two blocks from the Fremont Street Experience, so it's close to the action, but provides a convenient, quiet, and peaceful haven when you need to recharge your cells. \n\nThe rates are comparable to other downtown properties. I paid ~100 a night for a room in the South Tower of the Golden Nugget, and it was not even in the same ballpark compared to the suites at Streamline. Plus, the Golden Nugget charges an additional $20 a day to use the fitness center - what's up with that?\n\nSince my wife and I prefer downtown Vegas, I'm *really* looking forward to our next trip, where we will be \"living large\" in our suite at the Streamline Tower.", "helpful_votes": "10", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-10-24T09:06:42-0400", "location_id": "1201001", "id": "21172683", "user": {"username": "dirkpitt-numa", "user_location": {"name": "Whidbey Island", "id": null}}}]}
