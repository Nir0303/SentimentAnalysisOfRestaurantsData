After a short visit I walked out with $80 of food and a couple of gadgets after having a perfectly prepared meat and cheese platter. This place is a mix of many cultures. The pastry chef is Jamaican, there are all kinds of ethnic foods to purchase and our snack was more Italian than anything else. So if you are looking for a place to grab a quick lunch or snack without going into a restaurant this is a great place to go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-29T12:40:16-0500", "location_id": "2208959", "id": "351960356", "user": {"username": "Rick S", "user_location": {"name": "Deerfield Beach, Florida", "id": "34176"}}}]}
