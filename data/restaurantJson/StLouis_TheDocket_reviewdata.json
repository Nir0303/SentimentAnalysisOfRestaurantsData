Both dishes were prepared well and served promptly.\n\nThe second time my companion had pizza and I had the stromboli sandwich. There seemed to be a glitch that day in the orderly flow of orders. Several times the wrong order was brought to a nearby table. Our food arrived correctly. The pizza was served on a wooden plank with pizza shears and large containers of parmesan and red pepper. The stromboli had a generous dish of delicious marinara on the side. The service was a little on the slow side and we had to wait for our check-fix this please!
