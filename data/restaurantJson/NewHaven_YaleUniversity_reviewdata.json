First of all, parking is horrible, which is to be expected at Ivy League schools.  I parked in the Crown Street Garage in Downtown New Haven which cost $13 for the day.  The Old Campus off the New Haven Green is stunning with mature trees, great architecture and students focused on their cell phones who will walk right into you.  As you continue walking north you enter the newer parts of campus, which is sprinkled with many building designed by great architects.  Unfortunately, the grounds and in many cases the buildings are in poor condition.  A great example is Rozenkranz Hall by Cesar Pelli which needs a good cleaning, and the flower beds were full of weeds.  Most of the buildings have (very rude) guards so you can\u2019t easily explore them.  As others have noted, the city of New Haven around Yale is very poor and scary, so be careful.\nMust see buildings include the Becton Center by Marcel Breuer, a masterpiece in concrete with no guards so you can explore the first floor.  Paul Rudolph\u2019s architecture building which has a second floor gallery open to the public.  The Payne Whitney Gym has a hall of fame for famous athletes from Yale who have gone on to great success, even presidents (if you can get past the rude guard).  The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library which was just renovated, and of course the Yale University Art Gallery and Yale Center for British Art (both free).  But possibly the best building on campus is Eero Saarinen\u2019s Ingalls rink which was open on my visit and you could explore the entire building.   It looks small on the outside, but a soaring concrete arch supports the roof on the inside, like a shorter version of the gateway arch in St. Louis.  Saarinen was a master and this building shows his great skill.  Best building on campus.\nThe architecture of Yale still beats Harvard by a mile.  And while some buildings and landscaping need cleaning and repair, Yale is still more respectful of them than Harvard.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-31T16:08:55-0400", "location_id": "106090", "id": "433392769", "user": {"username": "jjctraveler", "user_location": {"name": "Chesterfield, MO", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Such a beautiful school", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33851-d106090-r431100797-m11068-Yale_University-New_Haven_Connecticut.html#review431100797", "text": "It's a beautiful place.
