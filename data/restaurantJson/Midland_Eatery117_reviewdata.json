Although we had dinner in the bar, where the dancing was, the dinner menu was from the hotel restaurant, Eatery 117. To say it was mediocre would be generous because it was actually quite awful.  I had the sea bass and it arrived completely smothered in a \"Bearnaise\" sauce which I am quite certain was made from a mix. The fish was grossly overcooked.  It was accompanied by a huge glob of mashed potatoes, which we all suspected were instant.  Presentation was... white.  Very unappealing appearance.  My husband had the lamb and said the gravy was so salty that it ruined the dish.  It also came with the glob of potatoes.  One person had a bowl of tomato soup which he said was inedible and returned.  Even for a hotel this restaurant was exceptionally bad.  On a bright note, the dancing was great.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-15T07:36:09-0400", "location_id": "10305813", "id": "373078357", "user": {"username": "grayhog", "user_location": {"name": "Midland, TX", "id": null}}}]}
