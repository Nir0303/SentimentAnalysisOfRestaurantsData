We dont ask for much, but no ketchup, or no lettuce. Like a special order is just a little too much for them to handle. Go through the drive thru most of the time and have to continously ask for game pieces as they have apparently decided they would just keep them all themelves. To top it off the last order they decided not to give us the fries we paid for. Contacted them online with a notice but have had no response as of yet. Seems like since they decided to serve breakfast all day they cant get lunch and dinner right. Stop serving breakfast all day and go back to getting it right.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-04T20:58:21-0500", "location_id": "9456858", "id": "330786273", "user": {"username": "Michael M", "user_location": {"name": "Fremont, California", "id": "32411"}}}]}
