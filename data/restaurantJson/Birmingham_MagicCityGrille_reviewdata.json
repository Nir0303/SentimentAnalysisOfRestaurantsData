I Googled for a restaurant in town with C&W on the menu. Only 2 restaurants came up. The first I\u2019ll try next time, but that day I decided to go here. After a nearly 30 minute drive I met a friend and we walked into MCG to a very cold non-greeting. No one acknowledged us and it was not obvious if/where we should sit. A waitress was passing by for a 2nd time so I stopped her and asked if we should seat ourselves. She dryly confirmed that we should. This waitress, older lady with pink hi-lites in her hair, pink jewelry and pink Chuck Taylor Converse sneakers (breast cancer awareness month? Rocked!!), ended up being our waitress. She was totally unfriendly during our entire visit.  She was dressed so spunky with an attitude that just didn\u2019t fit. I thought it was just her personality or mood that day. But then the lunch crowd started trailing in and she was nice to everyone else who sat near us.  However, she stayed ice cold to us. So I\u2019m taking the treatment personally. We gave her no reason to dislike us. Then our food came. I had fried chicken wings with waffles and scrambled eggs.  It was quite yummy.  The chicken was hard though, but tasty enough that I cleaned my plate. Unsure if I\u2019ll ever go back. My score for MCG is low because the chicken was hard and the staff was so unfriendly to me and my friend. However, the food was quite tasty and maybe the chicken is not always hard.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-10-24T09:16:10-0400", "location_id": "823949", "id": "182245676", "user": {"username": "kinkytop", "user_location": {"name": "Birmingham, AL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2013-10", "title": "Good food, but TERRIBLE customer service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30375-d823949-r182243202-m11068-Magic_City_Grille-Birmingham_Alabama.html#review182243202", "text": "Within the past 2 weeks I have had TERRIBLE RUDE experiences with this restaurant.
