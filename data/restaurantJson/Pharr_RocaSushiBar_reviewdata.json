This place was a total disappointment in that sense. Rolls were pretty average & a great value. Waitress was very rude when she became confused about our bill. Definitely won't be returning. The rolls are drenched in the traditional sauces even if it is not specified in the description. Be weary of that as their spicy mayo is obviously left out to sit at room temperature for too long--it was very sour tasting. Hadn't been there in a very long time & hadn't expected it to have made such a terrible decline.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-05-13T13:19:28-0400", "location_id": "4823018", "id": "205426936", "user": {"username": "thereeds_2704", "user_location": {"name": "Edinburg, Texas, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great Sushi", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56452-d4823018-r185145102-m11068-Roca_Sushi_Bar-Pharr_Texas.html#review185145102", "text": "I ordered a California roll, and mixed rice.
