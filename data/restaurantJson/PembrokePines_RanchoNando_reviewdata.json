I ordered a typical and common Colombian dish called, Bandeja Paisa. The plate includes a serving of thin sliced flank steak, pan seared; red beans; white rice; sweet plantain; and an arepa. Needless to say this is a large plate; however, it was still missing something.  Usually, the plate comes with a fried egg Over the top, but it was completely missing. Anyway, the meal was fairly average and as hungry as i was, I was delighted with the meal. My husband had the breaded pork chop, again fairly average, but he too was just as hungry and therefore, satisfied with his meal. The best part of our meal was the live entertainment of a one man band.  The ambiance was perfect for just having an enjoyable night out in the town. It seems to be family run and the place is very cozy and inviting. Our waitress could have been more helpful with the menu, but she made herself available throughout out time we were there. Prices are average to slightly above average, but once you add the music, it's worth it! We plan to go back again.

It is rare that I go to a restaurant and have such an amazing overall experience. I loved everything about this restaurant. It is just about as perfect in every way as any restaurant could be. This is a restaurant that I believe is true to its Colombian core.\n\nFrom the moment I entered the restaurant to the time I left, I felt as if I were an honored guest in someones house. They treated me and my family as such and our experience is one I will not soon forget.\n\nI have uploaded pictures of the items we ordered. I chose their special meat plate. I love meats, especially BBQ ribs. I know how difficult it is to get perfect ribs. This place made some of the best ribs I have ever had. From the quality and taste of the meat and seasoning to the tenderness and the perfection of the cooking their ribs, they were perfect. These ribs were ribs I could only dream of ever being able to cook. The freshness of the sausages and wonderful flavors they were able to deliver just added to the greatness of our meal. One of the best things on the sampler was the chicharones (I hope I got this right) fried pork rind fat and meat. It was so buttery and better than some of the best bacon you can find. The regional Latin accents including the potatoes, the plantains and egg pies took me to a place in Columbia I may never physically visit. However, I really felt as if I were there that evening. This Colombian soul food took me there. Look, the meal was just wonderful and perfect in its simplicity. The only sauce they had was some fresh pico de gallo that I used a couple of times. The meat was so good on its own I didn't want anything covering the taste. I recommend this dish to anyone who loves or can appreciate amazing ribs meats and sausage. We ordered this plate for two people and it was plenty for two adults and two children and we took some home. The dish for two, it should also be enough for two hungry meat eaters.\n\nWe ordered the fresh fruit drinks, guava and passion fruit. We got it made with water although they did recommend the drinks made with milk. These drinks were very good.\n\nOk, here is what also made this meal memorable. The way the restaurant is decorated is different from the typical restaurant. Walking in I felt like walking into a restaurant in Columbia although I have never been there. The night we were there, there was live music. The man was singing in Spanish, Spanish ballads and songs. It was a bit loud at first, but we did get used to it. The singing and music added to a wonderful experience. The singer came to the table and talked with us about the restaurant and the food. He also went ahead and promised to sing a few songs in English for us. The music was not intrusive. My family really enjoyed the live music.\n\nThe bathrooms were clean.\n\nWe really felt special at this restaurant. It is hard for a restaurant to create such a welcoming atmosphere. When we walked in they realized that we did not speak Spanish. They made sure that our waitress spoke English. I'm not sure it mattered as I'm sure I could have gotten by with my rudimentary Spanish and their willingness to accommodate.\n\nI really think this place is a great restaurant and you should support it. However, if you come here, try to appreciate it for what it is. Come thinking you are an invited guest and you will love it even more. This is not for the early bird crowd. Come for a relaxing evening with friends and be prepared to dine for an hour or two.", "helpful_votes": "5", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-30T19:21:59-0400", "location_id": "7125374", "id": "262787872", "user": {"username": "Stompper", "user_location": {"name": "Columbus, GA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Loved It!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34548-d7125374-r261670004-m11068-Rancho_Nando-Pembroke_Pines_Florida.html#review261670004", "text": "Another great find.

The default language here is Spanish but you won't get any attitude for speaking English. You will love the smell as soon as you open the door.
