Several additional facilities were added after 1900 when Minnesota became the largest primary wheat market in the world.\n\nLike most of the historical buildings throughout this city we thought this one was rather square and modular however, viewed up close and also from across the street it seemed dignified and commanding - if you can call a style that! \nIt\u2019s the external ornamentation and columns that adds gentility to the overall plainness of the style.\n\nWe had a great time exploring the historical buildings including this one in Minneapolis!\n\nEnjoy your experience too!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-08-22T09:35:56-0400", "location_id": "560188", "id": "138017252", "user": {"username": "Globebugs", "user_location": {"name": "Australia", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-08", "title": "Vintage 1902 Commercial building in Minneapolis", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43323-d560188-r137392582-m11068-Minneapolis_Grain_Exchange-Minneapolis_Minnesota.html#review137392582", "text": "I was there yesterday and not so sure what the other poster was talking about.
