This restaurant was recommended by friends who had eaten there several years ago. They said the food and atmosphere was wonderful and we decided to try it out before us for ourselves. \n\nWe were NOT disappointed. We made a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waiter was extremely attentive(wish I could remember his name)and such a nice guy.   He gave us ample time to choose our meals and gave us suggestions when we inquired about the dishes they were serving. \n\nI ordered the special, prime tips. They were delicious and so tender. They came with garlic mashed potatoes, grilled Brussels sprouts and carmelized onions. So very delicious and plenty of food. \n\nI would recommend Ophelia's to anyone in the Independence area. They do get very crowded on the weekend so I would suggest you make reservations before you go. \n\nThis was an awesome and enjoyable evening for both of us. We will definitely go back to Ophelia's if we are ever back in the area. Thanks for a great evening.  Oh yea, for dessert I ordered crem br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was wonderful.

Others had chocolate variety plate but felt souffl\u00e9 was undercooked. One person ordered a 2nd glass of wine that never arrived. Waitress did not stay on top of water/drink refills.  The menu had a good variety but for the prices we expected better service especially since they weren't that busy.

I have to say everything was perfect, the banquet managers did a fantastic job working with us on everything. The food was amazing, everyone could not praise the food enough. We had the beef tenderloin, the chicken with goat cheese and pesto, and the grilled salmon and many people including my husband had all three options. \nAfter the reception, which the wonderful staff at Ophelias offered to tear down for us, we went upstairs to their Inn. The master suite was beautiful, I just wish we had stayed there another night to be able to fully relax and enjoy the beauty of the Inn. \nWhether you are looking for delicious food or a beautiful, comfortable room to stay in, you will not go wrong with choosing Ophelias.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-07-11T00:30:01-0400", "location_id": "1207568", "id": "214781816", "user": {"username": "Lynn E", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
