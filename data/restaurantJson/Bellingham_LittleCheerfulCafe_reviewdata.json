She enjoyed and ate all her toast, a lot of the fruit and shared the rest with me.  The sausage gravy and biscuits were perfect to my taste and I gobbled it down.  Unfortunately, after the eggs, too, I was too full to eat all my hash browns which were mixed crispy all through - very good.  They slice the hash browns themselves (not frozen from a bag), bake their own biscuits, and make their own gravy.  Our server kept the coffee cups topped off perfectly and with a smile.  Oh, and they bring a little pitcher of half & half to the table with your coffee!  We enjoyed this place and will be back while we're visiting.  Breakfast and coffee was just over $24 plus tip.
