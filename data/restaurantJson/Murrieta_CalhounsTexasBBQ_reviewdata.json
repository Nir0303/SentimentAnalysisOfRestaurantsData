We ordered 8 lbs of meat for a family gathering.  To save time we stopped in a few days before the event to pre-order and get details about when to pick it up, how to pay etc.  Their food is slow cooked and so is their service, but I don't mind waiting.  The Family is very friendly and unassuming.  Once we got home I couldn't wait to dig in.  My favorite was the brisket which was tender and delicious and kept me coming back.  Their sauce marries nicely with the meat.  I recently had Phil's at Petco, and Mike's in Escondido which are both pretty good, but I prefer Calhoun's any day.  Lucille's has a bigger variety of options, but their flavor doesn't come close to Calhoun's.
