My favorite (when I used to eat gluten) was the Quatro Papparrazzi, the roasted garlic was so good! Now my kids and husband get to share the delicious pizzas, and still get to indulge in the salads. I also like the dolmas, although my daughter who is 8 was not a fan of those. You won't find a nicer business owner, there is a reason he has been in business so long. This restaurant is clean and the food is consistently good. He stays with what he knows, and he does it well. He keeps his restaurant clean, and small enough that he can manage it very well. The seating inside is a somewhat small area. I think that he probably does a pretty good business with takeout and also at lunch. I definitely recommend trying this restaurant!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-20T11:39:28-0400", "location_id": "4645072", "id": "407979509", "user": {"username": "Bruiserfan", "user_location": {"name": "Carrollton, tx", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Great calzone!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55588-d4645072-r312803428-m11068-Paparazzi_Pizza-Carrollton_Texas.html#review312803428", "text": "In town for business and was looking for a good pizza place near the office.  Looked on Yelp and this place came up with good reviews so I decided to try it.  The reviews did not lie!  I ordered the calzone americano and it was delicious!  You can tell that the dough is made in-house because it was very light and fluffy.  The key here though is the tomato sauce.  It was very robust with a lot of flavor which is perfect when dipping with a calzone!  \n\nA lot of the pizza/pasta places forget that a good tasty sauce is the main ingredient that will define your food.  This place has some of the best sauce I have tasted in a long time.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated and very clean.  George was at the counter and was very friendly to all the patrons and thanked them all as they left (including me).  \n\nI am here for the week so I will definitely be back!  If you are in the area and are looking for good food I would recommend this place highly.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-09-22T11:29:38-0400", "location_id": "4645072", "id": "312803428", "user": {"username": "elgrecostl62", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Great Food / Good People", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55588-d4645072-r270424021-m11068-Paparazzi_Pizza-Carrollton_Texas.html#review270424021", "text": "The owners are always so nice and usually remember your name.
