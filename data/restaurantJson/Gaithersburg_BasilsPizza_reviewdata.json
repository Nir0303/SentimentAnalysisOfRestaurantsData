I placed an order online with a 45-60 minute wait time. I ordered two chicken filet sandwiches with fries. There were options to add lettuce, tomato, onion, etc. I did not check ANY of these boxes!!! The order arrives 75 minutes later cold and covered in toppings including sauce and cheese that can't be removed. I called and they said if I didn't want toppings I should have been more specific. How does not checking off any toppings leave room for confusion? And if they were confused, they had my cell and could have called. The guy on the phone was a jerk and could not have cared less about having an unhappy customer. I will NEVER order from these guys again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-16T02:31:48-0400", "location_id": "1057795", "id": "419076599", "user": {"username": "Selica1", "user_location": {"name": "Gaithersburg, Maryland", "id": "41154"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Pizza was good, but hard to eat having witnessed the surroundings", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41154-d1057795-r232531372-m11068-Basils_Pizza-Gaithersburg_Maryland.html#review232531372", "text": "I had higher hopes for this local business, across the parking lot from a domonoes. If you like greasy spoon's, this place fits the greasy part too well. Unfortunately it's not clean, is down right dingy. It's too bad - the attendant was a nice guy, (probably the owner), the pizza was good, and it isn't a Dominoes or Pizza Hut. I prefer to shop local businesses, but even the Dominoes across the parking lot was cleaner by a long shot than this place. \n\nA few examples: Feet literally stick to the floor as you walk in and around the premises. The chair legs are black a few inches up from the floor from washing the floor half-heartedly with dirty water. The rest of the chairs are blond wood, also not very clean looking. Our pizza came with a piece of cheese with hair embedded. The table tops were clean, which is important, but since I knew I'd never go there again, I didn't bother looking at the underside of the table top. They'd been scrubbed to death though with little finish left around the edges. \n\nAnother concern is the complete disregard for concerns over polystyrene - every dish is polystyrene except the pizza boxes.Cups, plates etc. Disappointing. \n\nSo if your dorm room is a sty, you'd likely not notice this place's filth, replete with cobwebs, stains on the ceiling, greasy glass, sticky floors and an undercurrent of grime.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-10-04T07:01:04-0400", "location_id": "1057795", "id": "232531372", "user": {"username": "Vegetalicious", "user_location": {"name": "DC Area", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-06", "title": "Bit greasy but fast and kinda good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41154-d1057795-r134089097-m11068-Basils_Pizza-Gaithersburg_Maryland.html#review134089097", "text": "Rather good price for a pizza.
