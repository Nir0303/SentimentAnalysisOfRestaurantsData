Received outstanding options and came repeatedly to try several.  Highlight right off the bat was Hong Kong Lavender Green Tea Latte.  I could drink them all day.  Amazing.  Paninis, Sandwiches, and Wafflewiches, all excellent.  My favorites are Capri (mozzarella, pesto, tomato, and basil) & the Copenhagen (muenster, pork belly, & tomato), both paninis.  The sandwich I love is the Santorini (hummus, spinach, avocado, onion, cucumber, sprouts, roasted red peppers and herb spread) and, of course this wonderful place also supports local musicians and artists.  Oh, did I mention that the Wafflewich not to be missed is the Monte Carlo?  There are vegetarian and gluten free options.  Cupcakes - that's my next guilty pleasure.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-25T10:43:12-0400", "location_id": "11403276", "id": "422140989", "user": {"username": "newinelsinore", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Elsinore, California", "id": "32595"}}}]}
