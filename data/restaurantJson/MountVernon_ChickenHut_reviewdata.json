Vernon and happened to pass by Chicken Hut Restaurant and they had a sign in the window with their specials. The prices seemed insane so I went in. My order was 3 pieces of chicken, leg and thigh plus fries. My total bill $4.25. Really!! Can this be real. Got my chicken apparently right out of the fryer so it was very hot.. It was actually tasty but oh so greasy. If you ask for some extra napkins, then press these firmly against the chicken pieces and use them to sop up the extra oil, the chicken is actually not that bad and the fries are Ok. For $4.25 I got 2 legs and a thigh and a bag of fries, this is not a bad deal.  It's not a gourmet meal but then you are not paying for one. Interesting experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-29T13:47:35-0400", "location_id": "4619482", "id": "314873360", "user": {"username": "Maurice S", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}]}
