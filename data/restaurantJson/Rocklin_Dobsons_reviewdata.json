Bring him back. Very friendly staff but food didn't hit the mark at all. I ordered baby back ribs but was served spare ribs. The ribs were VERY tough and very fatty poor quality. Could not even tear meat off the bone. Half the rub was inedible grisle and fat. What meat there was was super tough and not tasty. I just couldn't eat them. Not sure why I got spare ribs since baby backs were the only ribs on the menu.\nThe side ( Mac n cheese) was ok but not the gooey goodness I was hoping for.\nThey asked how I liked it and asked if these were spare ribs... They confirmed... And said since I wasn't a fan... They would bring some baby backs... But waited another 10 min and they never came.\nI would try again just because they were friendly and I always root for mom and pop businesses. Would steer clear of ribs and try diff side. I am a little leery BC I'm not sure why they woul serve up such poor quality meat...

The ribs were perfect, smokey, not too done, but came off the bone nicely. We also had pulled pork and tri tip. The tri tip was ok but not as good as I'd have liked. There was some smokey flavor but it was a little basic (but to another that might be how they want it). The sides were good; garlic mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, beans, and cole slaw. And the service was nice. I think it was the owner, he came out and said hello asked how the food was. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars was that the pulled pork was overcooked and drowned in sauce. It was too mushy for my taste and I'd prefer my pulled pork with sauce on the side but I maybe should've asked for it that way, I'm not sure. I'd go there again for the ribs and try the chicken as well. Glad to have a place like this near bye.
