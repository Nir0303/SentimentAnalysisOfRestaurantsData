Well worth the extravagant calorie count!  Half pound burger topped with peanut butter,  bacon,  provolone, lettuce and tomato.  Could only eat half but was assured the other half will reheat well. The peanut butter sounds very odd for a burger but it is delicious and different.  The side of fries was luke warm.  They had good flavor but just not hot.

Special on Wednesdays is the Baron Burger for $5 however I decided on the Black and Blue burger for slightly more.  Beef taste was wonderful, Gorgonzola cheese was tasty, Cajun slices were not over powering.  Side of onion rings were good. Service was prompt and attentive.  Baron's burgers beat out all the chain burgers and most all off the locally owned places burger's.  Try them, you won't be disappointed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-11-25T08:11:00-0500", "location_id": "4086368", "id": "329015652", "user": {"username": "JLOaks", "user_location": {"name": "Suffolk, Virginia", "id": "58224"}}}]}
