Visiting old town Kissimmee, there is a plethora of places to eat! Now known as Julie's Broadway cafe & bakery, it's one of the first places you come to on the strip.

Everything is seasoned perfectly, the yucca and potato salad are amazing! Portions are huge! We were served a complimentary bakery item at the end of our meal, can't remember the name but was similar to a cannoli and WAS TO DIE FOR! Great ploy giving you a sample, you immediately wanted more and bought it!
