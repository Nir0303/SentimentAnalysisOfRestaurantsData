Being I had just had pizza from another Mellow the day before, my wife and I opted to get salads and share a 10 wing order. The small chef salad was less than $5, so I was not expecting much.

The wings are baked, tasty, and seasoned well (I ordered medium buffalo style). The food made up for lack of staff ... and we will certainly go there again.
