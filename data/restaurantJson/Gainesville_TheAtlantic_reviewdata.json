Rude, drunk bartenders that give you the wrong beer. There's nothing worse than an aging scenester, balding bartender with half a buzz and a \"control\" issue. The DJ was spinning 80's tunes, but without regard for mixing the beats and making the music danceable. It was probably being played on an iPhone streaming Grooveshark. Sucks. Also smells overwhelming like urine in the men's bathroom, I mean worse than a gutter punks piss spot.
