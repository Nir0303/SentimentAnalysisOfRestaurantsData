Not amazing, but not that bad. Although I did order a panini which looked amazing on their menu and they also claimed that they use an authentic English press for their panini...  It says it right on their menu. What I got was two piece of flat bread that was toasted yet soggy from the eight lbs of cheese that was all over my plate. Our secretary had gone over to place our order on this day and was told that she could not order a kids chicken tender meal! The lady Maria really would not give us a kids chicken tender meal...  Maybe they should have realized with our $70 order that there might be some children eating!!!!? We have a business nearby and probably will never order from here again knowing that this is how they handle their business. Such a shame. I have included in my review a picture of the panini I got. So sad compared to their menu picture.
