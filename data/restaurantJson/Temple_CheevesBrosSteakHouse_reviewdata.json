For appetizers I recommend the onion soup and the lobster bisque. for the main the NY Strip is unbeatable. The wine list will have you pondering long and hard as there are many excellent choices to choose from. Dessert itself is a feast onto itself as there are many fine choices. Favorites at our table included the Bread Pudding and the Cr\u00e8me Brulle. I can recommend too the Caf\u00e9 French and the Irish Coffee. The service is attentive and efficient. what more can you ask. come here when in the area, you will be glad that you did.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Rajee P, Manager at Cheeves Bros Steak House, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for the wonderful feedback about your dining experience at Cheeves Bros.

I especially love their lobster bisque.  We can't eat here often because the food is very expensive.  That said what you get for what you pay is a good value.  In a larger city the pricing could easily be 20%-40% more than it is.  I enjoy going for lunch since they offer some plates at better pricing.  If your looking for a very nice dining experience for a date or business lunch/dinner, and you don't want to make the trip to Austin or Dallas this is the place to go.

We dressed up and felt right at home at Cheeve's Brothers. Service was outstanding. Waiter was there when you needed something, but never hovering or annoying. \n\nAppetizers all looked good, but we went with Oysters Rockefeller. They were a great start to our meal. We then each selected a salad. The Blue Cheese wedge was wonderful with lots of blue cheese. The Caesar Salad was also great, with the option to include anchovies. \n\nWe then each ordered a steak. I tried the New York Strip and my wife selected the rib eye with a crab cake. Both steaks were cooked correctly and were wonderful. \n\nI will agree this is not an inexpensive place, but it is not trying to be. This is a nice steak house with a great wine list. We looked at the seafood section of the menu and it all looked good as well, but this was a steak night for us.  \n\nThey do offer a lunch menu and it is much less expensive. Might be a great way to try out the restaurant.
