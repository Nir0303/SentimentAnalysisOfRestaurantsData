There was a smell in the restaurant of garbage with all the dirty dishes.\n\nI offered to sit at the sushi bar at 1 free space, but that did not motivate anyone to clean the two spaces next to me which were piled with smelly fishy dishes. So I asked to move to a table. The waitress cleaned one table for me. Then she took my order.\n\n40 minutes later there was still no food, and there was no explanation. When I told her that I had to leave she said all the food is coming. I got up and walked to the register to pay for my diet coke and edamame and noticed that my food was nowhere near coming. The very slow sushi chef was preparing something with the fried crab inside.\n\nAfter she charged me $5.75 for a diet Pepsi and an edamame she explained that they had run out of rice. They had to wait for more rice to cook. Such a warning when I had walked in would have been appreciated. It's after 9:07 p.m. and I still haven't eaten dinner.\n\nI've eaten here so many times they know me by name, but never again.
