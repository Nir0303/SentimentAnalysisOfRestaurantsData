This place is huge. They can hold outdoor concerts on an arena sized stage or hold smaller concerts under the covered area they have. This was the case for this show. The band was fantastic by the way. The set up here at Concrete Street is really good. Plenty of places to get food and drinks so there never seemed to be any long lines. I saw many people here with children so I found the open use of pot by quite a few groups to be really bad. Not a good thing to expose your children to. I saw Concrete Street staff walk right past people smoking weed and not even bat an eyelash. I guess this is expectable behavior here because the Corpus Christi Police that were walking around did not do anything about it either. The management should really do something about this as it casts a bad light on a great place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-29T08:17:39-0400", "location_id": "4588734", "id": "412322900", "user": {"username": "john b", "user_location": {"name": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "id": "60927"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "KILLER VENUE", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60927-d4588734-r403894340-m11068-Old_Concrete_Street_Amphitheater-Corpus_Christi_Texas.html#review403894340", "text": "Took 3 teens to see Panic at the Disco and it was awesome.

Great show.  This is a good concert venue.  Great views of the stage, love the grassy hillside, comfortable and trees provide some shade from the South Texas sun.  The lot is divided into a standing area (no chairs) and an area where you can bring chairs.  Plenty of food and drink vendors, plenty of shaded areas, plenty of free parking and getting in and out of the area was relatively quick and painless.  This is far better than any stadium or Arena concerts I've been to; Plenty of restrooms so there was no line.  Drinks are quite pricey ($6.95 for 16 oz beer; $3.50 for soda and water) so I suggest a primer before entering the venue!  Roadies had sets removed and set up between bands very quickly.
