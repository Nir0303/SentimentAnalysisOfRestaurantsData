The Server followed us and provided us with 3 lunch express menus and 3 BREAKFAST menus! He took our drink orders and took 15 mins to bring them to us and then forgot one order and had to come back and ask again. We did not receive any water glasses.\n\nOnce we realized we had the wrong menus we couldn't get our Servers' attention to request the correct menus. So my husband gathered the menus and went to the front cashier and got the correct lunch menus.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, I had a coughing jag and desperately need water. Again we couldn't get our Servers' attention, so my husband went to the front cashier and asked for a round of water. After what seemed like forever our Server delivered 2 glasses of water to a table of 3!\n\nThe food is average at best. There were 3 of us; I had the super steak burrito, which tasted \"ok\" but it was VERY dry. Husband has the crab enchiladas, which he said was very good. Our friend had the fish tacos which was \"not bad\"\n\nIt took 3 requests to get a food container and 2 requests to get our bill. Hands down this place has some of the worse service that I've ever experienced. The food is NOT worth the dealing with the poor service we experienced. \n\nWe won't return and definitely would never recommend Tequila Grill.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-09T15:07:08-0400", "location_id": "4960701", "id": "416619338", "user": {"username": "2marcopolos", "user_location": {"name": "Fairfield, California", "id": "32367"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Pretty good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33023-d4960701-r407125381-m11068-Tequila_Grill-San_Leandro_California.html#review407125381", "text": "I visited this place with my family. \n\nThe place itself is very family oriented and they have a nice big menu. \n\nI noticed that they had horchata but I opted for a beer on tap. \n\nFor lunch, I chose the chiles relleno. They plate came with a large deep fried chile and a lovely sauce over it. We had a choice of having a full portion (2 pieces) or half portion. \nThe flavor was very good.\n\nI would have rated this place four stars but the service was so-so and they let a very loud busker come in to serenade at tables for tips. I didn't enjoy that part as the busker was more or less shouting the Mexican song rather than singing.
