It looked like most people were doing pickup. The menu was broad, but she recommended that I get the 1/2 pound steak sandwich. Although it's not in the form of steak (more like a long burger) it was very, very good. It comes on Texas style grilled toast with just the right amount of butter on it. She got one too, but the differences were that she got the mushroom sauce and American cheese on hers and I got mine with mozzarella and minus the mushroom sauce. They were both very good. the fries were hot and fresh as well. Only drawback I see is that they don't offer free water. You can buy bottled water, but that's it other than soda.
