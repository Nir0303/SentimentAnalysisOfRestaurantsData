Having read other reviews on this, we were compelled to try it as we're long-time locals.  The atmosphere was authentic and the staff were very friendly.  Will be a great choice for Happy Hour, and we will definitely place this as one for frequent dining.  The food was equal to typical Mexican chain restaurants, but a little less expensive.  We spent $20 without margies for two.  Their house margarita is good size at $5, Cadillac margarita is $8.
