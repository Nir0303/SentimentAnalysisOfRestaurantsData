We went as a group of four and we did the Pandemic room as our first. We escaped with seconds to spare out of our one hour time limit. I must say that the feeling of actually winning at this is extremely rewarding. Your logical thinking, problem solving, and teamwork will be put to the utmost degree. After having a great experience our first time around we went back as a group of five, I lured my friend from out of town to come along. Although we didn't succeed at the second attempt, it was still a blast no less. The staff really gets the anticipation up prior to going into the room. If you are stuck at anytime they will give you hints via a TV that is in the room.
