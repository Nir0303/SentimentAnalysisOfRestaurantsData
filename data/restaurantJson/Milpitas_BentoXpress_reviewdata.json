Today I had to work in the neighborhood again and I had to come here. I have been craving it for awhile. I usually get their #7 Bento Box teriyaki chicken, tempura, California rolls, salad, rice and soup. The teriyaki sauce is excellent, the tempura perfect, California rolls good, the salad dressing delicious and the soup flavorful. Bento Express has been consistently excellent for decades. Other establishments I've been to don't compare. The staff are always friendly and quick with a smile. The interior is nice and clean, plus the TV usually has surfing or another sport on. Usually I just get a water to drink, but this time I bought the Strawberry Guava drink. Oh the memories of Hawaiian Paradise strawberry gauva necture gives me. Deep Sigh...

Plus, they give you a ton of food for the price, which is lower than any Japanese restaurant you can think of.
