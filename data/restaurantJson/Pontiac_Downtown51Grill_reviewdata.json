We were a little concerned as we were the only one's there besides a couple of people sitting in the bar area.  Our waitress took our drink orders and food orders in a nice timely manner.  As the noon hour came around, more people came in.  Actually, a lot more people came in.  Turns out the bartender, hostess, and waitress are all the same person.  She was working alone!  It didn't take long for her to become frustrated with customers asking for more water, how much longer the wait would be, etc.  My particular table had asked for individual receipts.  Mind you, there were only 4 people in my group.  I think that threw her over the edge.  Every time we  asked her something she nastily said \"its going to be a few minutes\".  Anyway, our food was quite good.  Maybe a bit pricey for the area but regardless, it was good!  The fries were to die for.  We all commented on how good they were.  This place could be a real goldmine if they had decent staffing.  Until then, you won't see us back there.  Pontiac is not known for its booming downtown so its obvious the people dining there are most likely working in the area.   Working customers typically don't have more than 1 hour for lunch and when we do sit down for lunch, its to relax, not get attitude.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-03-24T14:55:57-0400", "location_id": "5571667", "id": "198572636", "user": {"username": "metikosh", "user_location": {"name": "Highland, Michigan", "id": "42306"}}}]}
