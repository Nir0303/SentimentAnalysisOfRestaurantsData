I've eaten at other Vietnamese places in Modesto and this is the best I've had. They have 3 different sizes of pho depending on how hungry you are. I also ordered some rolls and they were tasty too! I ordered them with the fish sauce instead of the peanut sauce cause I'm allergic and it was good! They can get busy but this place is worth it!

Our server was kind enough to seat us away from the door because it was so cold outside, and sat us up on the balcony upstairs.  The Pho was fantastic, and the portions are HUGE!  Believe me, a medium bowl of Pho is more than enough for one person!
