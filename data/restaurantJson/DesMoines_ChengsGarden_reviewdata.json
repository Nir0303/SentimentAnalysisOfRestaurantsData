Order Cheng's Chinese. Check out the pictures of the amount of food you get. I ordered the pu-pu  platter and sweet and sour chicken with pork fried rice and a shrimp egg roll. Everything was good. I was surprised at the content of the pu-pu platter. It had shrimp, chicken, two types of egg rolls, pork strips, teriyaki chicken, on a stick, fried wontons and crab rangoon. Again, look at the pictures. It is very good.
