The selection of beers is weak and the neighborhood may be iffy to some. And careful where you park because you WILL get towed. It is ok to park in the office building parking lot next door after 4pm. Signs in the parking lot directly connected to the bar state where specifically Borus customers can park.    But I find myself stopping here because the wings, are amazing. Sweet chili   mmmmmm. Just wish they had a decent import or micro-brew to chase it down.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-08-01T23:19:07-0400", "location_id": "2228289", "id": "170384419", "user": {"username": "dberrios2", "user_location": {"name": "Waterbury, Connecticut", "id": "33963"}}}]}
