Pretty much a self-service motel. The rooms are clean but lack character or design. Beds are not very comfortable with short and lumpy mattresses and there are noisy aggressive thru-the-wall air conditioning units that blast cold dry air.\nStandard coffee, packaged breads, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit offered at self-serve breakfast buffet in the registration area.\nFree WiFi. Good value.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-20T05:17:01-0400", "location_id": "547952", "id": "356991770", "user": {"username": "Anthony A", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "id": "34227"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Old but Adequate", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34230-d547952-r351516284-m11068-Legacy_Harbour_Hotel_Suites-Fort_Myers_Florida.html#review351516284", "text": "We had a king room which by todays standards was small in comparison to other hotels we have stayed in.
