We each had the bistro filet as our main, the meat itself was cooked perfectly, but the sauces were too salty (I did the red wine reduction, he had the peppercorn). Wine list was decent, but not extensive (we had the Bordeaux and were pleased). Overall, service was great, ambiance was fantastic, but the food was just fine. We'd definitely go back for drinks at the bar, but I think we might give it a little time before checking out the food again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "KatharineBB, Manager at Katharine Brasserie and Bar, responded to this review", "text": "We wanted to reach out and thank you for your feedback regarding food, service, and atmosphere.

Our lovely server was at the ready with information and advice about the menu. Our vegetarian was made happy with lovely cast iron servers of fresh local produce. The piscetarian enjoyed a beautifully presented (HUGE) flounder meuniere . I chowed down on the Bistro filet, medium rare and tender. The Cookie Sampler and perfect coffee was a (well, almost) guilt free dessert for all three of us.\nBreakfast:\nNext morning we were thrilled to find that the perfection of the coffee the night before had NOT been our imagination. Fortified with this ever-flowing elixer of life, we experienced sweet potato pancakes (forget your diet, this is a delectable SIN), and possibly the best gruyere herb omelets forged by the hand of man.\n\nIs this place cheap?
