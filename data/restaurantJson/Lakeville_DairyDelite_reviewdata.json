I can't believe there aren't already reviews for it, because it is a Lakeville institution. They are open from April to October, and it's a sad day in the fall when they shut down for the season. All summer long, there are lines of people waiting for their treats. It is a favorite of kids on bikes, baseball and soccer teams, and families looking for something cold on a hot day. They serve ice cream in many ways, including traditional cones, shakes, floats, and sundaes, as well as their version of the blizzard. Their soft serve is as good as, or better than, Dairy Queen, and the prices are lower. Dairy Delite also has burgers, hot dogs, cheese curds, sloppy joes, and the like, which means you can go for an entire meal and not just dessert.\n\nWhenever you go, plan to wait for a bit. As mentioned before, the place is popular, and the service isn't super fast. The employees are working hard, but it takes a while to crank out all of their orders. Have a seat and be patient. The kids can play on the playground.\n\nStop by and see what everyone on Lakeville knows-- Dairy Delite is the best place for ice cream around.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-25T18:30:22-0400", "location_id": "8663764", "id": "313669390", "user": {"username": "CAChris33", "user_location": {"name": "Lakeville, Minnesota", "id": "43242"}}}]}
