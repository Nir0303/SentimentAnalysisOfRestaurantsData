I visited on a Monday around lunchtime and was promptly seated.  I was led toward a high table but I was there to eat and review some book material so I asked for a booth--I hate those high tables with a passion-- and she was completely fine with my request and sat me where I asked.  My server came around very quickly and took my drink order.  She had the multiple flavors of lemonade (and I mean multiple) memorized and brought mine out w/in 2 min.  She then took my food order and it surprised me how fast it came.  I'd guess 7 min.  I could be off but it was faster than you might expect anyway.  I ordered the turkey club with fried green tomato (a new sandwich to their menu) and it was very good.  Came on some grainy (healthy!) bread and had somewhat of a strong feta cheese-like taste to it.  Maybe it was the special mayo, maybe it was the fried green tomato, not sure but it tasted great.  I was very happy with my choice.  It was filling and something I hadn't tried before. It seems they (Applebee's in general) over-season the fries badly.  This has been the case at numerous ones throughout the state I've noticed.  They would be some of the best fries in any restaurant if they only used about half the seasoned salt mixture.\n\nWould/will visit again when I'm in the area.  \n\nOtherwise very happy with this Applebee's.  Lunchtime midweek at Applebee's is a much more tolerable atmosphere than busy nights, especially weekend nights.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-05-23T16:52:49-0400", "location_id": "457585", "id": "130492927", "user": {"username": "Huskee", "user_location": {"name": "Clare, MI", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Not many veggie options", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42835-d457585-r19232817-m11068-Applebee_s-Wyoming_Kent_County_Michigan.html#review19232817", "text": "Not many veggie options", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-06-10T18:14:59-0400", "location_id": "457585", "id": "19232817", "user": {"username": "Aaron K", "user_location": {"name": "Tokyo Prefecture, Japan", "id": "1023181"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Love their appetizers.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42835-d457585-r16030942-m11068-Applebee_s-Wyoming_Kent_County_Michigan.html#review16030942", "text": "Love their appetizers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-01-29T17:30:25-0500", "location_id": "457585", "id": "16030942", "user": {"username": "Kristin D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
