And it is quite good. Since it opened, we have been there twice so far, and will be going there regularly. We haven't tried their lunch buffet yet, but I'm sure that will change soon.\n\nOn our two visits, we ordered a few appetizers. The Yuca Frita is quite good and made for an excellent alternative to fries. I just wish the dipping sauce is a bit more interesting than what they served. We ended up dipping them in the salsa that they gave us with the tortilla chips.\n\nAnd if you wish to be able to finish your entree, do not order the the chicken wings. Oh my lord, I could just eat that and be happy. These are not even the full chicken wings. They are the drumetts that have been Frenched, i.e. the meat pulled to one end, leaving the bones to be used as handles. They are delicious, sticky, sweet, and finger-licking good!\n\nThe entrees, in general, are very good. The Lechon was crazy good. I've also ordered the skirt steak Cuban style and Puerto Rican style. The meat was very good, but I was expecting a bit more flavor and seasoning for each one of them. They felt like as if they were cooked with just salt and pepper.\n\nAs for drinks, I think they have the best Horchata anywhere. I've ordered it on both visits, and will continue to order it in the future.\n\nThe one thing that I found a bit disappointing is in the range of the menu. I think if you want to do a menu that includes Puerto Rican food, not having Mofongo is a major omission. I also think that there is a glaring shortage of seafood and stews from the three Latin regions being represented. They need to have other meats such as goat, lamb, etc. or various other cuts of meat such as tongue. I know that it is impossible for them to cover every single groups of cuisine here, and I'm sure they're rather do a few things very well rather than a lot of things poorly. Still, the limited range of the menu is the first thing that hit me when we first went here.\n\nIn any case, this is some place that we will go back to.

We were told to order right away because food would take about 45 minutes.  We ordered.  The watermelon aqua Fresca was refreshing and a it sweet.  A gentleman came around and gave samples of horchata and hibiscus aqua Fresca and they were both good.  The plantains and yucca were both good.  The sauces that accompanied them, one was sweet for the plantains and the other one was a ketchup/mayo blend for the yucca- better than French fries.  I ordered the puerto rican Style skirt steak that came with rice, Puerto Rican style beans, tostones (plantain garlic chips), potato salad and chimichurri style sauce.  Tasty and plenty of food!  My mom had the lechon- was good, needed some crispy skin.  My cousin had the steak sopes and she enjoyed them and my son had the crispy chicken taco and ate the whole thing along with some of my rice and steak.  We also ordered. A chile relleno with cheese and it was cheesy and the batter was not heavy.  Was my favorite along with the chimichurri sauce and fried yucca.  Would eat there again.

They made a table for four available for us, but the next party they weren't able to accommodate.\n\nThe Father's Day menu was Prix Fixe, with a price of $20 per person.  We hadn't planned on spending that much, but I prevailed upon our party to go with the flow.\n\nBecause there were four of us, and there were four different appetizers, we shared all of them....\n\nAfter an iceberg salad for each of us, we also shared all four of the offered entrees...Coconut Chicken, Steak, Chili Relleno, and Slow cooked pork.  All were unbelievably excellent, and the portions required us each to take sizable amounts home.\n\nThere were three offerings for dessert, so we ordered one of each, an an extra piece of cheesecake.  DO NOT MISS THE CHEESECAKE!  It's the creamy New York style.\n\nA word about the service: Though the restaurant was filling up rapidly, the servers continued to bring the food at a very reasonable pace.  We each had soft drinks, which they kept topped off fairly frequently.  Considering the newness of the place, and the size of the crowd, I'd say that they handled it very nicely!\n\nAll in all, the $20 seemed like a great value.\n\nTwo additional notes:\n\n1.  El Bistro Latino is BYOB.  TAKE NOTE!\n2.  There is a pleasant outdoor patio for when the weather cooperates.  Father's Day was just too hot for us to eat outside.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-22T09:12:44-0400", "location_id": "10465884", "id": "384928964", "user": {"username": "kiemjp", "user_location": {"name": "Near Chicago, IL", "id": null}}}]}
