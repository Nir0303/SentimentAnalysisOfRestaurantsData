Server (Maggie)  was very helpful and offered us a different sauce when we did not like the shrimp roll sauce, but we had eaten them since we were hungry with just the chill sauce from the table assortment. Would go back, but would go more often if prices were in line with most area Chinese restaurants since the ingredients are not that different. They  also sholud deep clean that place and wash the windows which were yucky!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-22T07:06:11-0400", "location_id": "471709", "id": "261049568", "user": {"username": "Marphilwi", "user_location": {"name": "wisconsin", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "Best Thai in town!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59929-d471709-r260459259-m11068-Bangkok_Garden_Restaurants-Green_Bay_Wisconsin.html#review260459259", "text": "GREEN Curry!

My fianc\u00e9 orders something different every time we go and always loves it. He has a VERY high tolerance for spicy foods and they can always accommodate that! I, on the other hand, cannot tolerate any spice and they are always on top of that as well. The staff is always friendly and fast. Cannot say anything bad about this place.
