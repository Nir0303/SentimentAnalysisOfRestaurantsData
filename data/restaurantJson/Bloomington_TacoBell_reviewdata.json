Decent food...fair prices...usually correct orders. We stopped in for an early dinner recently. It was very quiet when we arrived and ordered immediately. My taco salad was pretty good. It could have used a bit more lettuce/tomato/sour cream...but not bad at all. This item seems to be somewhat higher than it was the last time I ordered it...which wasn't all that long ago. This is alright...but...it's not like I was getting more...or better...food for the extra money. I like that they offer a drink 'Happy Hour' from 3PM-5PM. You get select medium sized drinks for just $1.00. I always forget this...but their employees are fantastic about reminding you if you order a more expensive drink. Nice gesture. The restaurant is normally well-kept...clean floors...trash not overflowing...tables food-free. When I do run into issues at this location...it involves the drive-thru. Not every time...but frequently. It's normally the speed of how quickly the line moves. I've waited upwards of 10 minutes in line to get my order...after placing it. I realize things can happen...but that's ridiculous. Overall though...it's an alright location. It has an outdoor dining patio for weather-permitting months...that's a nice plus. We'll always stop in for a quick bite.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-28T12:39:34-0500", "location_id": "1089222", "id": "335532435", "user": {"username": "StarletteSkye", "user_location": {"name": "Murderapolis", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Our first time", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42881-d1089222-r286448137-m11068-Taco_Bell-Bloomington_Minnesota.html#review286448137", "text": "To give a proper perspective of my rating, my wife and I are Asians who just arrived at Minneapolis after a 19 hours trip and this was the nearest food available from where we stayed at the hotel.
