On a day where the heat index went to 100 degrees, it was a little warm at the table!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-14T17:03:06-0400", "location_id": "3440876", "id": "405470909", "user": {"username": "12RAS302", "user_location": {"name": "Albany, New York", "id": "29786"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Delicious food, BYOB", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g48572-d3440876-r404817459-m11068-Tara_Kitchen-Schenectady_New_York.html#review404817459", "text": "You either need to arrive by 6:15 to score one if the three indoor tables for four or wait for the first group to turnover.
