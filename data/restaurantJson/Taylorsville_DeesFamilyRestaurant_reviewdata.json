They are a regional chain, but out shine all of the national chains.  They downsized a few years ago and closed a few locations.  The remaining locations do a good job with breakfast as their specialty.  There isn't one close to where I live, but I enjoy breakfast for dinner and when I get that craving the drive is worth it.   It has a retro diner feel and good family appeal.  The location I frequent has had the same staff for years and a lot of 'regulars'.  It's not the BEST breakfast in town, but if you like breakfast at odd times, this is a good choice.  They have a good selection of other 'diner' menu choices including pies, whole or by the slice.
