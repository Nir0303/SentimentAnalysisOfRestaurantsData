The king size bed was comfortable along with the pillows. Breakfast comes with the stay and it's your normal chain quality which was ok. We decided to go off site after a couple days to get a different type of breakfast We used the rooftop hot tub almost every morning which was clean and nice we didn't use the pool because it was quit chilly out. I want to give a shout out to Sonja she is the concierge at this Holiday Inn and she is the most pleasant, happy, outgoing, knowledgeable person I have ever met at a hotel chain. They have a gem with her and hopefully realize that. She is a big part why my wife and I will be coming back to stay here. If you stay here you need to reach out to her for any of your excursions or dinner needs. Thank you Sonja for all your kindness and help we will miss you and feel like we made a new friend in you. So our stay at Holiday Inn was a nice stay the room was nice and a nice size  The only thing I think they could improve on is the quality of the breakfast and mix up the entree from day to day. Hopefully your stay will be as great as ours was.

We refused to pay such an ridiculous fee for parking and I can't imagine what they could possibly have done to make it worth that price. We parked on the street and had to walk a few blocks to our car but it was perfectly fine other than that. \n\nWhen we attempted to check in we couldn't remember whose name the room was under (our bad) so we had the woman check for both of our names. We carefully spelled our names and after looking for about 10 seconds she loudly declared that we were at the wrong Holiday Inn and would have to leave. We finally found our confirmation number to prove to her we were at the correct place and after finding it she rudely declared that we should have just told her the correct name for the room in the first place. Being fed up and embarrassed I snapped at her that we had spelled that exact name out letter for letter not 5 minutes earlier. She laughed it off and I was too angry to push it. \n\nThe room we got was not cleaned well or we'll attended to. The clock had yet to be changed for daylight savings two weeks earlier, there was what appeared to be a large splatter of an unmentionable bodily fluid across one the pictures above the bed, the drain cover in the sink was missing, the information booklet was missing all of the pages, and we were left with only about a quarter roll of toilet paper which when we called the front desk to ask for more they could not be bothered to bring it up to us and they said very snarkily and with no apology that if we wanted it, we'd need to come to the front desk ourselves. There was an apparent lack of water filtration as all of the water had a strong sulfur odor and taste. And finally, we were kept up much of the night because there was very little if any sound proofing and we could hear doors slamming throughout our entire floor. \n\nNeedless to say, we would not stay here again nor would we recommend it to anyone. We were very disappointed with our choice.

The staff was quite nice, hotel looked impressive, breakfast was great and the bed was comfortable. I liked certain things and disliked others at this location.  Walking in one direction, you were in party city, walk in another direction, we found ourselves in an uncomfortable area. Riverfront walking was a few blocks away.  Valet parking was $27, street parking was nonexistent.  Something I found very interesting were the room types.  The 1st room we were assigned was as you normally find in a HI hotel.  Moved though because the TV didn't work.  The 2nd room was about 2x the size of a bathroom. The bed was right at the door, you open the door, the bed was a couple inches to the right (not good). No micro nor fridge.  Moved again though because I needed a fridge and for whatever reason, one could not be brought to the room. 3rd room had a drain in middle of bathroom floor, hair stuck to the wall (???), hair accessories and candy on floor, NO CLOSET, iron and ironing board on floor in corner, Bay street side, very noisy.

The check-in was fast and every staff member was extremely nice from the valet guys that gave out free bottles of water, to the nice people at front desk, housekeepers and guy behind the bar.  The location is just a few blocks from Paula Deen's restaurant and one of the squares with outdoor music and entertainment, so we could just walk there. The pool on the roof was very nice.  While we were there our cell phones went off with an Amber Alert and just as we were getting ready to settle back to sleep, the fire alarm went off @ about 2:00 in the morning so we had to evacuate until the fire trucks came and cleared everyone to return to our rooms.  The next morning one of the two washer machines was broken, but the girl at the front desk game me some more quarters so I could start again. Also, the tub/shower faucet was stripped so it was difficult to turn on or control the water.  The pleasant staff made up for any of the hotel's short coming, as it could use a good face lift.

First of all, the $27/night for valet comes out of nowhere and it is almost a sure thing unless you want to look for parking everytime you come and go. I booked a double room on the hotel's own website in June at a good rate. Room was not ready and I was told a double room was not available at all and I would have to settle for a king. Not a good thing for a family of 4. We returned 3 hours later to see if room was ready (which it wasn't) and the family ahead of me who walked in off of the street was offered a double room for $30 more than what I paid. They declined and left so I asked if a double became available. The front desk person didn't know where to hide her face and caved. They were nice the entire time but I didn't appreciate the attempt at the switch. When we finally got the room, it was clean and comfortable. The staff is very kind and attentive.
