The staff taking our order was quick, efficient, &our food was ready when we picked it up.  From the Tapas menu we got the pork meatballs \u2013 3 for $5; they were covered in a Thai sweet chili glaze, and strips of fresh basil leaves.  Now, I am being serious & not exaggerating when I say that when I cut into the meatball it smelled like cat food.  I asked my husband to come over & while I hadn\u2019t said anything about it, he said the same thing.  So, needless to say that was a big turnoff.  But, we tasted the meatball & it was okay.  It was a bit crumbly & didn\u2019t hold together well.  The glaze/sauce was cloyingly sweet & the basil just made it sweeter.  It was a bit overpowering & not an appropriate accompaniment to the meatballs.  \n\nAlso from the Tapas menu we got the hibachi vegetables with a ginger buttermilk tarragon dipping sauce for $7.  The veggies were plentiful, but we were really hoping for a sear on them from the hibachi grill.  They seemed more steamed and were fairly bland.  We did not like the sauce as an appropriate accompaniment to these veggies.  The buttermilk was so strong the sauce made our mind go to ranch dressing/some mayo based dip.  I didn\u2019t taste any ginger & the tarragon was just not strong enough to make the sauce balanced.  We dipped the veggies in the Thai sweet chili glaze from the meatballs & not even that was palatable.  The veggies were fine on their own after we added some badly needed seasoning. \n\nWe had ordered after 4pm on a weekday; at that time only Tapas, salads, & pizzas are available.  We ordered 2 pizzas.  My husband got the sausage & peppers pizza, which he enjoyed.  I got the pesto mushroom pizza.  The crust was thin & crispy, which I liked.  The pesto was very flavorful and spread plentifully & evenly.  My favorite was the mushrooms \u2013 they were very flavorful, plump, juicy, & plentiful. \n      \nThe portions were appropriate for the price.  Venture Kitchen is appropriately named, as they are adventurous in their flavor combinations.  Some work, some need work.  It\u2019s worth a visit to sample their menu; I don\u2019t think we\u2019d go out of our way to return\u2026.but we might come back some time to try more of their pizzas since ours were yummy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-14T10:52:38-0400", "location_id": "4593304", "id": "427943853", "user": {"username": "ucstefi", "user_location": {"name": "Hampton, Virginia", "id": "57804"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Not the friendliest place.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57804-d4593304-r425168768-m11068-Venture_Kitchen_and_Bar-Hampton_Virginia.html#review425168768", "text": "I stood around for at least 3 to 5 minutes before anyone greeted me, but I was not made to feel welcomed in their establishment and I will never return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-10-04T17:18:51-0400", "location_id": "4593304", "id": "425168768", "user": {"username": "X2484YEcynthias", "user_location": {"name": "Hampton, Virginia", "id": "57804"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "The place for foodies in Hampton Roads", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57804-d4593304-r422460483-m11068-Venture_Kitchen_and_Bar-Hampton_Virginia.html#review422460483", "text": "We've never had anything but great experiences here.

Seating is in booths so it wasn't cramped for dining but I expect a wait during busy times. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. Venture fare is primarily tapas and pizza with just a few entr\u00e9es. I chose the \"must have\" tater tots, scallops, and seared tuna. The tater tots were good; I'm not a fan of fried foods and would have preferred them a little crispier; and the dipping sauce was very good. The scallops were exceptional! Probably the best I've ever eaten. The scallops were served on a bed of pasta with a light tomato sauce that was very good. The seared tuna was extremely good and very fresh. The seaweed salad that accompanied the tuna was interesting, fresh & crisp with a pickled flavor, and did not fit my tastes.\nI will be back to Venture on future Hampton trips.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-08-30T12:10:24-0400", "location_id": "4593304", "id": "412856471", "user": {"username": "Max_22150", "user_location": {"name": "Springfield, Virginia", "id": "58202"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great place to eat & drink", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57804-d4593304-r409673284-m11068-Venture_Kitchen_and_Bar-Hampton_Virginia.html#review409673284", "text": "We visited this place during our stay in Hampton.

We have tried a variety of Tapas bars in the Tidewater area (Norfolk, Newport News, Virginia Beach, etc.) Venture is by far our favorite. The cheese board is one of our favorites. The cheeses are always well-chosen and excellent quality. We love the fried green tomatillos, but unfortunately they have not been on the menu this year. However, all their Tapas are delicious. Their pizzas are also excellent. My husband usually orders a pizza along with our shared Tapas. If you're looking for great cocktails, they can be a little disappointing. I ordered a mojito and when it arrived, I found there were cucumbers in it. This was not to my taste at all. It did not taste fresh. When I sent it back, the waitress told me that that is how mojitos are made in their restaurant. I have tried several other mixed drinks in Venture, but find that their bartender is not as talented as their chefs. I think the owner should invest in a well trained bar tender to boost drink sales. For drinks, we usually stick to beer or wine. However, since we usually only have one drink, it is not an issue for us. The food makes it well worthwhile. They also have nice roomy booths, which can fit a party of six, if you call ahead.
