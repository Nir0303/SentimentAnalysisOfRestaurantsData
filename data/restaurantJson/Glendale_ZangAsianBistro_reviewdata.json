First, the restaurant has a pleasant modern airy setting. It is open for lunch and dinner every day of the week  except Mondays. The host and staff were friendly and attentive and appeared to be sincerely interested in our opinion.\nThe menu is wide and varied offering selections from China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and other Asian countries. Zang also has a full liquor license.\nWe started out with what we thought would be a traditional hot and sour soup but turned out to be a delicious variant thereof. Rich, loaded with vegetables, tofu, chicken and shrimp, it had the requisite heat and was served family style. My wife ordered Panko Chicken and I had Hoisin Beef. Both were  outstanding, the Panko Chicken delicate and tender and the Hoisin Beef rich with flavor and the portions were generous. The entrees, of course came with the requisite large bowl of  rice. Three variants of tea are available: oolong, jasmine and black. \nAs noted above we thoroughly enjoyed the food, service and setting and definitely plan a return visit (probably more than one).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-12-24T13:05:41-0500", "location_id": "855487", "id": "122071325", "user": {"username": "KA7AOK", "user_location": {"name": "Avondale, Arizona", "id": "29038"}}}]}
