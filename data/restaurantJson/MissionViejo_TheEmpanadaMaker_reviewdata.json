This is a quick-serve restaurant. You order at the counter and then your order will be served at your table. There is a large display case that has the empanadas on view. The pastry was wonderfully flaky, the empanadas are served piping hot, and there is enough variety to please any eating style (meat eaters, vegetarians). I enjoyed the spinach and cheese as well as the green chili pork. Both were delicious! I will say that I thought it was a little pricey...$7 for two empanadas and a beverage (I did not get any sides), but that won't stop me from coming again. I'd like to try some different flavors. Oh, and what is so brilliant is that the server who brings your food will know automatically which empanadas are yours (if in a group) because the empanadas have a number baked into the corner of each one!! Brilliant!\n\nI will say, and this is absolutely NO FAULT of the restaurant, but there is a High School directly across the street and MAN..when school lets out, the kids are all walking about, staring at their phones, nearly walking into cars, the parents are plugging up the entire parking lot with cars picking up their kids. It's too bad the parking lot cannot be monitored not to allow these parents in, it completely overwhelms the businesses who have the misfortune to be in this particular location.
