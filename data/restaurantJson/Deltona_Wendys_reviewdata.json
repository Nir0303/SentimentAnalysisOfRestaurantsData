Don't get me wrong,  I like Wendy's food chain establishments.  Trouble is, this one has always been a disappointment.  To give you an instance of disenchantment: their small order of chili.  I enjoy Wendy's chili, but this one is chintzy on what they put in the cup.  Every other Wendy's that I've visited FILLS the cup.  Saxon avenue fills it three quarters full. The first time I asked them to please fill the cup.  The manager said it was the proper portion according to the Wendy's guidelines. I sighed took it and drove off.  Next closest is in Orange City, where they fill the cup.  Downtown Orlando on the Orange Blossom trail, they fill the cup, and every other one they fill the cup.  It is tasty, but the lack of meat in the sauce as well at the Saxon avenue establishment should be rendered as Mexican Tomato soup with bean(s)!.  Over the years I've visited them (I live here in Deltona, so I guess I'm a glutton for punishment)  it still is there 'policy'. In addition, I like fresh French fries paired with a repast of some sort of beef on my bun.  I've had to ask them for fresh French fries because the ones served with my bacon burger (which was luke-warm) were limp.  A tip, ask for French fries fried with no salt, if you've got the time, and they have to make them fresh, then just before you leave the drive thru, ask for salt packages. As I said in the beginning of this rant, or shall I say review, Wendy's as a chain is ok, but from this one... stay away!
