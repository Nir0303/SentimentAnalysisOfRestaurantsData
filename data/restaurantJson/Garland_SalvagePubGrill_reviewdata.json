A co-worker and I went for lunch and I ordered the Fish and Chips and my co-worker had the Texas Cheesesteak, both based on our waitresses (Sabrina) recommendation.\n\nOther than two people at the bar, who were not eating, we were the only ones seated at a table when we first arrived.  Two other groups came in before we left - one ordered an appetizer and I don't know what the other table ordered.  One elderly woman came in but after looking over the menu, she left.\n\nOur order took what seemed like forever.  When it finally arrived, it looked really good.  Sadly, that's as good as it got.  The fish were fried up to a nice golden brown, but alas, there was absolutely NO seasoning whatsoever.  I tried the tartar sauce but it tasted like pure mayo with some dill added to it and was not appealing at all.  When Sabrina asked if I wanted Malt Vinegar I guess I should have gotten it - at least then the meal would have been flavorful.  The fries were excellent but not enough to fill me up.\n\nMy co-worker said the Cheesesteak was so-so and her salad was average.\n\nWhat a disappointment to pay $10 for a lunch and I was still hungry when I left.\n\nI did try to make a comment to Sabrina about the lack of flavor on the fish when she came by and asked if we were finished (seeing one of two fish filets on my plate and 1/2 a sandwich on my co-workers plate and she didn't ask if we wanted it to go?) but as soon as we said \"yes\", she turned and walked off.\n\nOh, and the person who did the proof-reading on the lunch menu needs to look it over again.  On the back, it says they have \"Dailey Soup - ask you server\".  Dailey should be \"Daily\" and \"you\" should be \"your\".", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-11T10:53:43-0400", "location_id": "7045936", "id": "391451635", "user": {"username": "texasmomGarland_TX", "user_location": {"name": "Garland, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Not Impressed", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55884-d7045936-r330418794-m11068-Salvage_Pub_Grill-Garland_Texas.html#review330418794", "text": "I have been there a few times since the New Owners and Name, and have left disappointed both times.

Right on the square and walking distance from all kinds of other things like shopping and the DART rail it is the perfect place to stop and get a burger or have a drink. They only have a few beers on tap but they are all excellent. The pub burger is inexpensive and REALLY good. Pretty much everything we have eaten there has been excellent, all the burgers are amazing, cole slaw excellent, fries YUM! The only exception was the chicken fried steak was not very good, and the salads are a bit small for the price(but still good tasting). Service is quick and everyone has been super nice. This is one of those places that when you go they know you and treat you like family when you come back. It was formerly \"The Corner Pocket\" and now they have started offering pocket sandwiches for lunch time. I really enjoy myself every time I go. Oh and they always have games on for the sports fans.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-31T11:03:23-0400", "location_id": "7045936", "id": "225731319", "user": {"username": "dianac7diana", "user_location": {"name": "Garland", "id": null}}}]}
