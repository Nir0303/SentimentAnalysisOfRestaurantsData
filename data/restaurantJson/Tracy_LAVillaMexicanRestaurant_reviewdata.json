The other problem with this Restaurant is they just keep raising and raising their prices and they are to the point that there prices are that of a real good quality Mexican Restaurant, and La Villa doesn't have the atmosphere or the quality of food to charge that kind of money. In short, average is the word, and I simply won't go back as the quality of the food for the price charged is way off!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-02-19T05:57:03-0500", "location_id": "819393", "id": "255229817", "user": {"username": "wingnut5", "user_location": {"name": "Northern California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Can't bet the price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33184-d819393-r251691780-m11068-LA_Villa_Mexican_Restaurant-Tracy_California.html#review251691780", "text": "Great food, fast service, very reasonably priced and great family atmosphere!

We decided on Mexican food and came here around 12:30pm. The THS cheerleader's were obviously at lunch as well. However, we were served quickly and received our meal promptly. My husband had the enchilada's which he really liked and will be eating leftovers today for lunch. I had the flauta's (chicken) and they were delish. The guacamole was a bit heavy on the lime so I didn't care for it. We really enjoyed their menu and food. Down side is the after effects of \"Old oil.\" Please change your fry oil more often. Second time I have eaten at a Mexican Restaurant and this was the case. I will give it one more try and if it happens again. Well, I won't be back. A bit pricey for lunch.
