There's one table outside on a narrow sidewalk.  All of the furniture and the decor is that shabby rustic look with several layers of paint showing through.  It's not all that attractive but interesting.  \n\nWe got fairly prompt service.  The lunch menu was literally small - about 6\" by 11\".  We had to look up what some of the ingredients were like telera bread, which I tried.  It was very a thick toasted bread that was so dry/toasted that it feel apart in my hands, but I liked the flavones of the ingredients of thus sandwich.  I also got a flour taco too as part if my combo order.  It was just okay - more like something you'd find in any restaurant that sells Mexican dishes as one if it's varied offerings.  Luckily we still had some salsa left from our chips and salsa order and it made the taco more spicy.  The salsa  was excellent. My combo was $10.  The lunch menu ranged from $8  to $12.\n\nI only go occasionally because when we have a group of people Mexican food is usually something everyone can agree on.
