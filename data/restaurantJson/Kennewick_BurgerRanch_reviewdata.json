I had a bacon cheese burger and fries.  Both were good and appeared very fresh.  The soft drink selection is quiet extensive with carbonated and non-carbonated selections.\n\nThe staff was friendly.  The menu was an extensive assortment of fast food fare and included seasonal items such as asparagus and zucchini (assumed to be fried but I did not ask)\n\nOnce again, it was very clean.  In my past I have worked in fast food and I am picky when it comes to cleanliness.
