One was original crust and one was thin crust.  I haven't had PJ's since the \"recipe\" had changed and was really looking forward to it.  The crust probably would have been flaky but it was totally saturated in grease.  Totally unacceptable.   The cheese had a very funky taste and smell and the pepperoni was like eating shoe leather.  About half of the original crust pizza was all crust.....no cheese or pepperoni.   I will not be purchasing any more pizzas from this place and will stick to the mom and pop italian places for pizza from now on.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-28T02:52:45-0400", "location_id": "4777688", "id": "386929463", "user": {"username": "gigem74", "user_location": {"name": "Jacksonville, Texas", "id": "56039"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "3.5 stars based on quality/price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56427-d4777688-r324141698-m11068-Papa_John_s-Pasadena_Texas.html#review324141698", "text": "I like PJ taste that is why I keep buying PJ...however Dominos and Pizza Hut taste good too, and are cheaper in cost to quality ratio.
