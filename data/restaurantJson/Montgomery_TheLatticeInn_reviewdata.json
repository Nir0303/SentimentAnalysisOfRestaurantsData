It felt as if we'd been invited into someone's home, not a place of business and Jim continued this theme throughout our stay.

Jim gave us heart, soul, friendship in every way.  We particularly enjoyed Jim sitting with us and fellow guests at breakfast each morning chatting as we ate his lovely breakfast meal, giving suggestions as to what we might do, where we might visit.  Cookies waiting for us when we got back was a thoughtful touch we just couldn\u2019t contemplate happening in any hotel.  We were asked by some\u2026.\u201dwhy visit Montgomery?\u201d  Well, Jim and The Lattice Inn is one very good reason but we really did find lots to do and see in this quieter city.  I see The Lattice Inn is rated no.1 of 3 BnB\u2019s in Montgomery, we\u2019ve no knowledge of the other two, but can understand experiencing a stay in The Lattice Inn would be hard experience to beat for so many reasons.

Out in the leafy suburbs of Montgomery, this property exudes a wonderful southern charm. It's ideally placed in walking distance of some of the best restaurants in town as well as the charming Fitzgerald Museum. It's also only a 5 min uber from Central Montgomery. I'm so glad that we picked this place - we very nearly booked the comparatively soulless Hilton Double Tree in Central. Jim's place is full of personal touches that made us enjoy our time in Montgomery more than anywhere else we visited in the South!\nJim cooked a wonderful breakfast each morning and gave us fascinating anecdotes and insights into Southern/American life. He was happy to let me leaf through his book collection and even sent me links to all the music I enjoyed while in his house. He has a pool (not that we had time to go in!) as well as a beautiful lounge/library for use when you're not out and about. \n\nI can't recommend this B&B more!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-21T08:43:42-0400", "location_id": "72195", "id": "395134176", "user": {"username": "Jessica R", "user_location": {"name": "London, United Kingdom", "id": "186338"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Loved it", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30712-d72195-r393644344-m11068-The_Lattice_Inn-Montgomery_Alabama.html#review393644344", "text": "We loved everything.
