The restaurant was not busy so we had terrific service. There were two soup choices, cream of mushroom and salmon chowder. My friend and I each had a bowl of the chowder ($4.50) which was beautifully spiced, full of chunks of salmon and potato,mark and perfect for a chilly, clammy day. My hot hibiscus tea ($2.50) was great, and the waitress offered a refill of hot water at just the right moment. There's a great selection of sandwiches, several of which I've had before, but I opted for the \"grapes and goat (cheese) salad ($9.00), which was huge and delightfully full of yummy salad stuff. Ambition has funky interior decoration which is always entertaining to first-time guests. I highly recommend this spot, especially for its good selection of lunch choices.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-25T09:21:36-0400", "location_id": "1097185", "id": "367350905", "user": {"username": "TravelNut12309", "user_location": {"name": "Schenectady, New York", "id": "48572"}}}]}
