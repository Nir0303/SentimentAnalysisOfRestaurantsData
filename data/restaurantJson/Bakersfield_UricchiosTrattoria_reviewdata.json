Service was slow. My dish was delicious which was a chicken dish. While eating, our waitress disappeared after putting down the check which I will add, the tip was included. A few guests wanted to order desserts, but no waitress. When we getting ready to leave, the waitress came back.  Very disappointed the tip was added, for I would not have left a tip.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-17T17:02:41-0400", "location_id": "469239", "id": "406829230", "user": {"username": "Abie M", "user_location": {"name": "Arvin, California", "id": "29114"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great atmosphere, great food ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32037-d469239-r403818965-m11068-Uricchio_s_Trattoria-Bakersfield_California.html#review403818965", "text": "This is one of my favorite places to eat in downtown Bakersfield.
