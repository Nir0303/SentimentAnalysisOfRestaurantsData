We tried a few unique items and they totally missed the mark.  Some we didn't even finish.  The Potstickers we had as an appetizer were very tasty but that was it.  The sushi was very plain.  I don't think they were using the best quality ingredients, but it was not cheap.  We spent $40 per person (with 2 drinks each).

On a Saturday night, we walked in without reservations and found a table without issue. I was pleased with the martini menu and had two refreshing Pearl-tinis during our meal. The two receptionists we're not the ideal for this type restaurant; hubby and I both commented on their unprofessional behavior. Other than this, we had little to complain about. The selection of sushi and variety of other Asian dishes is incredible. We enjoyed seaweed salad, shrimp and crab puffs and 5 sushi rolls (6 pieces each). We've been to this restaurant before, over a year ago, and I thought that the dining room could use a good cleaning and a refreshing of the decor. And we've seen this restaurant much busier on a Saturday night, so much so that you would have to wait for a table. Maybe clientele has dropped off a bit, or the newer restaurants in the immediate area are more attractive to the Royal Oak \"crowd\".", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-22T14:53:17-0400", "location_id": "389716", "id": "216920130", "user": {"username": "geoniff", "user_location": {"name": "Detroit Metro, MI", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "soooooooooooo bad", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d389716-r216700105-m11068-Little_Tree_Sushi_Bar-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review216700105", "text": "worst sushi ever!!! warm soggy sushi rice, had rolls dipped in tempura and there was still raw batter omg sooooooooooooo bad threw it out.
