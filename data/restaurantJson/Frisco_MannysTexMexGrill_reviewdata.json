Love love love the food.\u00a0 I can honestly say I haven't had a bad meal here. Queso, burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, chimicanga...all delicious. My one overwhelming concern is the steady decline in service we have experienced over the last year or so. Our last three visits over the last few month have involved subpar service. From lack of friendliness and attentiveness I'm surprised more isn't being done to ensure improvement of customer service.  This Friday night specifically was no different in terms of crappy service.\u00a0 At 8:26pm there were several tables occupied and what seemed to be plenty of servers. However, there was one kid busting tables and working his butt off. He also happened to be the only person able to pass out chips. Apparently, that task is beneath the waitstaff as we recieved our queso before chips and then later on our empty chip basket sat on table for almost five minutes as three waiters plus the manager walked by...and nothing. After the bus boy, mentioned previously, cleared and cleaned four tables he got us our chips. Thanks kid! You worked your butt off while everyone else sat at the bar or on the stools by the hostess area watching the Olympics. Again, food is great, but the service is questionable at best.\u00a0 Oh, one more thing...though there was no one waiting to be seated, our waitress removed my plate as I was mid-bite....chip in hand I literally had to move my hand over her arm.  If this doesn't say things need to be looked at and fixed, I don't know what does.\u00a0 We will give it a few more chances before we switch to somewhere else for good.

She made my visit here and I will definately be back!\n\nWhen I walked in, I asked them about the advertisement online about Margarita Wenesday.  She told me they were actually new owners trying to get the website updated and they no longer did that special, however they would honor it, GREAT!  We sat at the bar and had Carlos get our first round of frozen margaritas.  In all honesty, the flavor was good, but there wasnt enough tequila in it.  I find this to be true with most premade margaritas, so I wasnt suprised.  I then tried the on the rocks margarita...and the frozen was better.  I prob wont have the margarita if I come here again as it wasnt worth the calories that I am sure are in it.\n\nWe ordered the cheese queso as an appetizer.  I mixed it with the salsa for a little more flavor.  The chips were nice and crispy and not greasy.  For entree I ordered the 2 enchilada plate and added a crispy taco.  The entree was great.  The chicken/sour cream enchilada had a lot of sauce on it, just how I like it, same with the cheese/chili con carne.  They were both really good and flavorful.  I could have used a little less salt, but seriously good.  Same with the taco.  Great flavor, little salty, but truly enjoyable.\n\nPortion sizes were large, and I had leftovers, which I ate for breakfast this morning.  LOL!  I was going to eat for dinner, but when I opened the fridge it was calling my name.  The atmosphere was fun.  Like I said Kim is a HOOT!  They will be having entertainment there on certain nights and she proceeded to give us a shout out from the stage welcoming us as first timers to the restaurant.  Indeed a GREAT time.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving them a 5 is because of the margaritas and the salt level, but honestly If they allowed a 4.5 that is what I would give them.  Take your friends, take your family, kids....the food really is good.  I was told everything was made fresh daily.  My friend didnt mention her food being salty, so it might have just been my palate.  I will definately be back, and will be on the lookout for my new buddy Kim.
