The bathrooms feature heated floors (a very welcome touch), large walk-in showers with European glass, good lighting, room on the sinktop for your things (not common on pedestal style sinks), and very comfortable towels. The bed linens are similarly high quality and the sleep experience is very comfortable.  Lighting in the bedroom could be improved as it tends to be rather dark.  Bathrobes are also very comfortable. \n\n The room does not have a small refrigerator which was a disappointment.  The guest kitchenette near the back entrance is thoughtfully equipped with a small refrigerator, microwave, glasses, cups, complimentary sodas, and coffee & tea.  This is a very nice feature.  It would have been nice to have bottled water, vs. the unpleasant LaCroix seltzer, in the frig and it also would have been much more convenient to have a small frig right in the individual guest room.\n\nThe staff is very pleasant - one person is there from 7 am - 7 pm and on call during the night.  The parking was safe and right behind the main building. The location is very convenient to walking around town.\n\nThe breakfast was the major disappointment.  Even though this is not a major decision variable for me in choosing a hotel, this was incredibly disappointing and a huge \"miss\" for a hotel that positions itself as a premium boutique B&B.  There is no menu and no choice.  There is no buffet at all from which to choose or to grab something to take with for a walk snack.  You are required to sit in the dining room and required to eat whatever the one thing is that they are serving that day (catered from some local company).  The choice is not a choice at all; the portions are miniscule, and nothing is healthy.   The wait time is ridiculous and a waste.  This is something that they should address immediately.  Given that they do not prepare food in the main kitchen, but warm up and plate what the catering company provides, it was surprising and mysterious why so much banging and clanging loud noises started and continued from the kitchen well before 7 am when breakfast does not \"start\" until 8 am.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "EdwardsHouse, Guest Relations Manager at The Edwards House, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to write such a thorough review.

For our first visit in May, our flight to Denver was diverted to Colorado Springs due to weather. We called The Edwards House to inform them, and they went out of their way to accommodate our late arrival. During the first full day of our August visit, we wanted to get an early start on our trip to the Rocky Mountain National Park, so we phoned them from Wyoming (before we even checked in) and requested a \"To-Go Breakfast\" for the next morning. As we left for the mountains, we found granola, yogurt and mixed fruit packaged in two boxes in the guest refrigerator. The remaining two days of our trip, we enjoyed the regular breakfasts. Our only complaint is that the standard breakfast portions are too large for our metabolisms, but if you ask, the staff will scale back the servings or package leftovers for later consumption. The guest kitchenette has a microwave oven that came in handy for reheating our leftovers. The guest refrigerator has a selection of cold beverages, and guests can use a Keurig to make hot coffee and tea. Fresh brewed coffee is available about an hour before breakfast is served if you want to get an early start on your caffeine. The Edwards House is an easy walk to downtown Fort Collins and CSU. It's also possible to walk to the Cache la Poudre River trail, and the New Belgium and Odell breweries are about a 1-mile walk away. If you are a light sleeper, the horn from the train that runs nearby may take a night to get used to. Overall, the rooms are comfortable, well appointed, and exceptionally clean.

Collins, and a highlight was the Edwards House.  (We were in the Collins room in the building behind the main house.)  We enjoy quirky, historic conversions like this.  Our room, for example, had a great clawfoot tub RIGHT IN THE BEDROOM!  But the room also featured a lovely little sitting area and a comfortable bed.  \n\nHonestly, it was all lovely.  The main house was attractive and inviting.  We had a very nice breakfast on the patio, but the dining room looked very nice too.  The young lady who checked us in and a different young lady who served us at breakfast were both friendly and helpful and just great folks all around.  I have zero complaints about location, staff or space (although if you're more accustomed to hotels, you'll find the odd room layouts and B&B experience a bit of a change).\n\nHOWEVER, I do dock the Edwards House one star because of what I perceive to be a high price.  At $200, this was a budget stretch for us.  Ft. Collins, overall, seems a bit pricey, so I'm assuming The Edwards House competes well in pricing...but if you are more price conscious (we weren't that day because it was vacation and we wanted something off-the-wall), you might want to keep looking.

The breakfasts were made from scratch and were truly memorable.  Fresh muffins and fruit crisps, fresh fruit plates, homemade entrees that were different every day were served with a side of warm, friendly service from a staff that bent over backwards to accommodate any special requests.  They made us feel like part of the family, not just guests.\n\nWhen I called to make a reservation for another visit to Ft. Collins a few weeks ago, I mentioned that I was so looking forward to the breakfasts.  To the staff\u2019s credit, I was advised that things had changed, and that breakfasts were now catered by one of the local restaurants to give guests a chance to sample local fare.  They seemed to remember us, as they said they noticed that we were in town for a wedding the last time we visited.  We had spent a week at Edwards House in 2014.  \n\nThings have changed, in many ways.  The accommodations are still immaculately clean, and there isn\u2019t a bad room in the place.  We stayed in the Meldrum room this time, but on our previous visit stayed in Lady Moon, Avery and Giddings. (Avery was our favorite).  While we understand that the business model of a B&B is difficult to sustain with a large staff, the reduction to one staff member has totally given the place a corporate vibe, and that seems to be the new focus.  Cassie and Luke were gone, and we did not recognize anyone on the staff.  We must have been \u201cremembered\u201d from a note in the computer.  There is no buzz of activity in the kitchen with the aroma of baked goods greeting guests.  Breakfast is now limited to one choice, (though I\u2019m sure special dietary requests would be accommodated), but there is no \u201clight\u201d option like a yogurt or fruit and cereal bar as there had been in the past.  A warmed-over breakfast cannot compare to the array of freshly prepared options we had last time.  The long table in the breakfast room has been replaced with tables for 2 or 4, and the formerly two-seating breakfast is now open seating from 7:15-9:15am.  Some will find this a welcome relief, but those looking to have the B&B experience of meeting other guests at breakfast will miss that aspect.  We met an eclectic group of people on our last visit, but this time we rarely saw more that one or two others at breakfast, and you could hear a pin drop most of the time.  There was little or no interaction among guests, and the atmosphere was much more like a hotel breakfast room.  \n\nAs another reviewer noted, the warmth is gone, and the focus has shifted to a more corporate clientele.  There were corporate meetings in the Manor behind the main house most of the days that we were there.  \n\nThere is still a lot to like.  There are cookies in the afternoon, a wonderful porch, and there is a new beverage station with a Keurig and instant hot water, a selection of teas and coffees, as well as complimentary soft drinks available to guests 24/7.  The location cannot be beat.  Guests can walk a few short blocks to downtown shopping and an array of restaurant choices.  Bike rentals are also a couple of blocks away, and there are trails that are easily accessible.  You\u2019ll need the somewhat buggy Zagster app to rent a bike from the bike library, but the staff in the bike library office in the transportation center helped us sort it out.  They are working to improve that experience.  Brand new helmets are sold for $5 each at that office. Ft. Collins is very bike friendly!\n\nWe would stay at Edwards House again, but we have to admit that the excitement about returning would not be the same, and the value would be more in the location than the experience.

It seems like they remodeled everything in this old house, but we're still able to Keep that \"old\" feel to it. Extremely nicely done. I stayed in the Manor House which was probably the guest house. It's a few steps across the little parking area and I found it to be quiet and private.

Which segues into why I could not give 5 stars.\n\nThe only reason I could not give 5 stars, because otherwise I would have, is the breakfast. When I consider a place because it has breakfast included, I anticipate that into my schedule so I don't have to seek breakfast elsewhere. Unfortunately, this place only has one item on the menu each day. If you don't like it, then that's it. My first morning they offered something like a sticky toffee covered French toast. Eating candy for breakfast is just not my thing. The next day it was small pre made breakfast tacos. Not my thing either. So, while I applaud them for trying to be unique, I do not agree that breakfast is the place to make that attempt. Pancakes and eggs is so easy and the environment there is so lovely, that a simple breakfast would be just fine and greatly appreciated.\n\nAll that said, the staff I met were all delightful and very friendly, and the location is just a few blocks from old town square.
