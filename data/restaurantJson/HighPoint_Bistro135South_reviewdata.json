There was only 2 other solo guests in the lounge when I arrived. I had the chef's salad which had some lettuce and a lot of toppings I was pleased with the salad overall almost a little too much on the toppings to lettuce ratio. The bartender was nice I assume he was inexperienced as he didn't multitask or combine trips or clear plates as guests finished. I also noticed dust along ledges and minor cleanliness things. If they're that slow you would think these things would be part of side-work. Overall was much better than breakfast service. I ordered a veggie omelette with egg whites. It seemed to take a long time to arrive for there only being 3 other people in the room. For egg whites it was very yellow. I asked server if it was made with egg whites she said it was. I had to ask for refills on water and it seemed like the servers were more concerned with who gets to go home first than checking on tables. I was pleased with the omelette overall it was huge and the fruit i ordered was fresh and good too. A server came by and was friendly and smiled and we briefly spoke about the weather. There's a few good ones and I'm sure the other ones could use more training to get better.  Overall if you're staying at the hotel it's convenient and good food. If you're in a hurry I would go elsewhere.

We went there for Valentines Day and I cant even use the excuse that they were crowded because except for us there was only one other couple and they were getting ready to leave. We were suppose to get 2 new York strips, but they were out and subbed filets which was fine. I personally would rather had the strip. We ordered them MR and one came out well done and the other med well. We sent them back and one came out MR the other Very Rare. I had the Very Rare, but at this point it was getting late. Service was extremely slow why I don't know. SO I ate it anyway. I had Risotto which had way too much white wine and was inedible. We ordered dessert molten lava cake. The molten part was still hard inside so we sent It back and got a cheesecake to go. The chef (I use this term lightly) microwaved it because it was frozen. It ruined it. I used a Groupon deal otherwise I would have been mortified at having to pay full price for this meal. What only cost me $30 would have cost $60.
