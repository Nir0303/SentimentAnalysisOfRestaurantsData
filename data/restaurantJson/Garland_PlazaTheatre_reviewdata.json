There isn't really a concession area, just a small space with a sink & refrigerator, so don't expect a wide variety of snacks.\nApproximately once a quarter, the City of Garland Parks, Recreation & Cultural Arts Department puts on a free movie. For instance, last Christmas the selection was \"Holiday Inn\" on a Thursday & \"White Christmas\" on a Saturday evening. \nI helped stage manage a revue for Veteran's Day, 2014 there.
