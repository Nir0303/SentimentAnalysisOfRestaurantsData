I have no idea why it is even rated a 39 out of 75 restaurants, which is not a very good score to begin with, but it was where I was shopping, so I gave it a shot. My lunch visit which was around 1:30pm started off well. I was seated in the bar area at a booth, by the friendly hostess. Guessing so the bartender could be my waitress, as there was no one else in the bar area, and only 2 other tables taken in the rest of this place. That person disappeared and I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap and fries when I got waited on. It was downhill from there. My food was brought out by someone else, and my waitress who was the bartender never checked on me, I had to flag down someone else who walked by to get ketchup, and yet another person to get a sofa refill. I want to be very clear here- I sat a total of 20 minutes AFTER I got my food without her checking on me, and only one other person came in and sat at the bar. She was oblivious. I had to ask someone walking by for my bill. When that person went to her with my request for the bill she came back all 'sing songy' of course because it was tip time. The fries were good, but the sandwich was tasteless.
