We visited on the last evening before leaving Phoenix. It was such a great value! You get to build your own 10\" pizza from the bottom up for only $7.99 with unlimited toppings. It's like an assembly station. You choose the crust first. I chose the traditional crust. Then, you choose from 5 different sauces. The tomato blend had a very nice flavor. There are 3 different cheeses. I chose mozzarella, but my husband got a blend of cheeses (he had a feta/mozzarella cheese blend). After the cheese is selected, you have to decide on a list of 20 different toppings. I chose the following: garlic, tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, and pepperoni. \n\nYou would think it all ends there, but it doesn't. You get to choose from 5 different seasonings as well as a variety of finishing touches. I added truffle salt and fresh basil. The basil was added after the pizza was baked in the oven. Delish! It was so tasty. I'd create the same pizza over again in a heartbeat. \n\nThe service was pretty quick, but that was because there was only one other couple in front of us. I can see it being very slow during peak hours of the day, but mainly because it takes time to assemble these pizzas. It's worth the wait.
