I will say for a brunch as wonderful as this the desserts were disappointing. \n\nMy complaint would be the room where the food was set up was small for the number of people there today. It's probably fine for normal Sunday brunch but today was not.  \n\nWe will come back to brunch here when we are in the city again.
