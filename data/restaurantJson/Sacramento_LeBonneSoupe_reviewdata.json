Ate there three times while in town on business, having the combo sandwich, soup, and drink combo for about $11. I had the tri tip beef, pork sausage, and crab melt, all excellent, fresh, SUPER tasty. Then I had the seafood soup twice and French onion soup, both awesome. The seafood soup is loaded with seafood, and is like a bisque. You can taste the homemade love in it in the food. Even the bread is delicious, and great for dropping in your soup. I would eat there again any day. Portions are good and the food is so delicious. \n\nThe bathroom situation is a little weird since its in the back down a hallway, and it's shared.
