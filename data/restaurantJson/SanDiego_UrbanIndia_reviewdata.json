This is a huge bargain compared to almost evertyhing in the Gaslamp. Big selection and it changes a lot - vegetables might include cauliflower, mushrooms, zucchini, sag paneer, etc. and meats have included both lamb and goat (I don't think I've ever had goat before in an Indian buffet) as well as several chicken dishes. The tandoori chicken is tasty, not too dry. I eat a lot of Indian food although I'm not Indian, and their seasoning is generally right on target for me - flavorful, but not too salty and not too hot.\n\nNote: It's a very large dining room. On nice days, we like to eat at the tables closest to the street.
