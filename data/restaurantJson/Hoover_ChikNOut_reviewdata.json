I don't know what it is, but the employees don't seem to know how to run the place. One time I paid $12 and got one taco and no chips, another time I paid $7.50 and got 2 orders of 2 tacos (4 tacos total) which was way more than I could eat. Leaving off the chips and salsa was another time and a combination of screw ups every other time. I have quit going here. I sure hope the owners are hearing this as I've put this review on Google.
