I was stopping by the library to do some research and decided to have lunch first.  The menu was just awesome.  Didn't know they served breakfast too!  I chose a Chicken Salad Sandwich on a Croissant.  The Chicken Salad was very much like I make at home!  Also had a cup of wonderful Potato Soup.  I was quite surprised at all the offerings they had on their menu and will definitely return again when I am in the neighborhood.

This is a casual cafeteria style restaurant. The food is from one of the best caterers in Topeka. Food includes big cinnamon rolls, scones, muffins, sandwich wraps, daily specials for breakfast and lunch/dinner, varieties of quiche, home-made soups and chili, fresh salads, cookies and delicious desserts, and signature coffee drinks. Coffee is PT's. The Wednesday hamburger special is a must try. Simply delicious. \n\n If you arrive after 11:30 am and before 12:15 pm, anticipate that you will be waiting in line. This cafe is the meeting place for many small groups and downtown workers. This is really the busiest time, so if you arrive before or after this very busy time, you will have a nice meal in a friendly atmosphere at a very reasonable price. \n\nThe restaurant is not owned by the library. The space is leased by PeachTree Catering. You can visit your library, pickup a good book or video, shop at the Boutique and grab a delicious dessert all in one location. That's a pretty nice afternoon. I'm marking this as inexpensive price food, but you can pick up a nice coffee and cinnamon roll or scone for under $8. A meal of 1/2 soup and 1/2 salad is under $10.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-18T12:11:32-0400", "location_id": "4466438", "id": "311632144", "user": {"username": "KSMeadowlark", "user_location": {"name": "Topeka, Kansas", "id": "60747"}}}]}
