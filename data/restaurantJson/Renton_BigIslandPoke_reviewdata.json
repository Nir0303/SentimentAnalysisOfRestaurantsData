The kimchi octopus was my least favorite meat, but I'm not a huge kimchi fan in general. If you like kimchi I recommend giving it a try. The other three options were fantastic: spicy tuna, Hawaiian tuna (lightly soy dressed), and salmon. Very fresh with good sized, well balanced portions. The sides, toppings and dressing choices are equally fantastic. The variety of tastes and textures is like a party in a bowl.  I highly recommend at least adding the seaweed salad and avocado! If you haven't tried poke and you like sushi, you have to go to Big Island Sushi!! It's the equivalent of 2-3 amazing custom sushi rolls, but in a bowl, and better.

I like how u can choose your rice. Brown rice is really good here. Also, they have good Kim Chee cucumber slices. The poke isn't salty or slimy and it doesn't have soy sauce all over it so it is super good. They put food in a nice bowl with a thick plastic lid. It's a bit expensive so can't go here too often as I would like. I think everyone should try at least one time as you will get hooked.

This is one of those times. The poke here has great flavor, with warm rice below it and a seaweed flavoring on top, with seaweed salad beside it. You can get a Hawaiian juice there, too, and yet are all really good. I love this place.

The Hawaiian style has great flavor and the Spicy Tuna has the right kick...not too spicy, just right. The flavors were heightened by the hot rice and was mellowed by the coolness of the crunchy cucumbers. Every bite was like an explosion of flavors. So \"Ono ono.\"\n(Ono = delicious in Hawaiian).\n\nService was fast and the personnel were  friendly. The price is directly proportional to the amount of food. Every bite was worth every dollar spent. \n\nThe place was clean and simply decorated. Getting to the place heading north on Ranier Ave gets a bit challenging. It's better to be southbound in my opinion, but once you're there, parking is ample. \n\nI shall return to Big Island Poke whenever I'm in the area...I might even make an excuse to make the drive.

We love sushi, so we were very excited to try this place. They only serve poke so they do it like subway style where you get to pick your base, your poke, your sides, your toppings and the dressing. Toppings are unlimited. Sides and avocados are $1 extra each. Here are the options\n\nBase-white rice, brown rice or chips (I think they were tortilla chips)\nPoke-spicy tuna, salmon, tuna and tako (octopus) you can pick 2 and do half and half\nSides-cucumber salad, seaweed salad (maybe there was more but I don't remember)\nToppings-cucumber, avocado, fish roe (I'm pretty sure there were more)\n\nI believe the poke bowl was $11 and then you can add on things for $1 each. \nWe also got the illikoi lemonade which was pretty good, but a little bit on the sweet side. They also have Hawaiian canned juices. \n\nThis place is in an old subway, so the atmosphere is really like a fast food restaurant. The place is small, only about 6-8 tables, but there are a couple of table outside too. The place is very clean and they play Hawaiian music. Bathrooms were also very clean. There were 3 people behind the counter and they were all very helpful with the process. \n\nOverall great little place to get poke, quick and cheap. I really want to say that this was the best poke I've ever had, but I would be lying. But I have been to Hawaii many times and I've eaten a lot of really good poke there, so I have high standards for poke. However this place is very good. Their food is good and fresh and I really love their concept! If you like poke, definitely give these guys a try! You won't be disappointed! I will be recommending this place to all of my friends!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-01T20:45:06-0400", "location_id": "10262959", "id": "369410042", "user": {"username": "kwanjai206", "user_location": {"name": "Snoqualmie, Washington", "id": "58748"}}}]}
