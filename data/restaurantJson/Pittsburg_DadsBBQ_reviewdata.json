Owned by a nice family! You can eat it there or get it to go. We ate there while a lot of people ordered it to go. We had the BBQ chicken lunch. It came with a side dish. I had the BBQ beans and my husband had potato salad. Both were delicious. They also served us sliced wheat bread. A nice homey, easy to find place for a good, reasonably priced meal!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-14T10:24:42-0400", "location_id": "4653866", "id": "392591251", "user": {"username": "TeresaMorefield", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
