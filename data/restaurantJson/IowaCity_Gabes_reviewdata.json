Fiber optics on the ceiling, sticky beer floor, sweaty bodies, single stall bathrooms plastered with band stickers. $4 Jim Beam. Intimate. A great place to be if you want to meet the band in person and have them sign your stuff. Get your tickets before, cause the show will more than likely be sold out!! (We did not eat, but could smell the grease from the kitchen through the floor; stage is upstairs.)", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-04-06T10:28:46-0400", "location_id": "4929423", "id": "200111960", "user": {"username": "L S", "user_location": {"name": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa", "id": "37743"}}}]}
