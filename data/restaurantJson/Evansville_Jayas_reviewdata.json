Only 1. The waitress. IMO the most important part of your restaurant, and if you have good ones, pay them more, they are worth it. Not going to list item by item, lets just say there were many, and not just from this one server. Jaya, you may need to shake up your staff.\nLets get to the Good! Easy to get to with ample parking in downtown Evansville. Close enough to walk to many attractions. Just off the \"Main\" drag of main street. Inside, very nice furnishings, a lot of space, not right next to the other diners. I was disappointed on a Monday at lunch this place was not packed with locals. I know 20 years ago there would have been lawyers and medical staff a plenty here. But there were not many this day.\nMany choices of hot tea. We had a party of 5. We had 3 different teas. All great, but not hot enough, the green tea did not steep do to the water temp.\nWe had fried calamari (very tender, lightly breaded) and sushi for appetizers. Sushi looks to be a hit here, I may go back alone just to try some more.\nWE had a few vegetarian dishes, some soups, the vegetable we had tofu added, it was very good. The vegetable fried rice was great, as was the stir fried veggies. We also had all of our egg role made veg only. Normally it is chicken egg roll.\nMy mother eventually got her order made without spices. I like mine hot, she does not even want black pepper. But the waitress could not understand that, and had it mad mild, which still had red and black pepper in the Stir fried shrimp. Large luxurious shrimp with tender veggies, one the seasoning was right, she really liked it.\nI had Pul Ko Kee, a beef stir fry with veg and black mushrooms. I ordered it hot, it was spicy, but not near overwhelming. Very good.\nThis was moms birthday, so Jaya brought out a piece of orange mandarin cake with a candle. It was very moist and very good as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-02-03T21:12:22-0500", "location_id": "3515411", "id": "193024416", "user": {"username": "Charles M", "user_location": {"name": "Evansville, Indiana", "id": "37093"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Average", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37093-d3515411-r186381217-m11068-Jaya_s-Evansville_Indiana.html#review186381217", "text": "This was my first time to Jaya's.
