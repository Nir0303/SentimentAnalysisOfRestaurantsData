Upon arrival, staff was quick to greet us and then let us pick where we wanted to sit which was great as we were able to snag a table by the window with a street view. We each tried 2 different beers with dinner and we were satisfied with the food. Prices seemed reasonable, the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that our server was slow to check back when we were wanting to order our second drinks to go with the meal. We plan on coming back for sure as we loved the ambience, food, and of course the beer :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-18T18:31:23-0400", "location_id": "6529342", "id": "374358900", "user": {"username": "Jennifer S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
