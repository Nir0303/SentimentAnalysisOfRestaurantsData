The owner of the company, Kevan, was our guide. (Check out his book, Legendary Locals of Asheville.) He is extremely informative, knows his local history very well, and the stories he told were very interesting. The pace was steady -  not too slow, not too fast. Even though nearly everyone on the tour lives in Asheville, it was so much fun to tour our own city and learn something new. I would highly recommend this for visitor and resident!!
