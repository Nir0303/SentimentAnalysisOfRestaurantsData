After seeing the reviews online and looking at their website, we thought..Ok expensive but it seems worth it. Those reviews oull the wool over your eyes. When driving down the street you can not even see the sign for it at night since it is completely black and there are no lights outside. One plus is that they do have FREE valet parking! Upon walking in we were greeted by the manager and seated promptly at a very nice and big booth. It was 8:30 pm on a thursday and there seemed to be only one other table in the restuarant besides us. Our server Wanda greated us in a timely manner and brought over water and the drink menu. She returned quite a bit later for our drink order. It took upwards of 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. Maybe totally understandable if it was a packed house but like I stated before it was not. After that seh took our food order I got the 4 course prix fixe which gave you an option of one of 4 appitzers (all seafood by the way, which for me a seafood lover is awesome but like someone like my boyfriend or our friend who are allergic to seafood it is not) then you can choose to have a soup or salad, then a chicoe of 5 entrees, dessert and coffee, tea or espresso. I chose the crab cakes that were literally phenomenal. They were cooked perfectly and laid on top of this delicious lobster sauce. I chose to have the french onion soup, which was ok really really really strong smelling of the brandy, and you could really taste it. My boyfriend chose the salad which was jsut some mixed greens thrown on a plate. Nothing else. My main corse I chose the Ribeye which is by far my favorite cut of steak so fatty and juicy. I ordred medium rare, some parts were rare some parts were well some parts medium. IT WAS THE WHOLE SLUE OF COOKING TEMPS ON A 24 OZ PIECE OF MEAT. Out of the 4 steaks ordered at the table not one came out at the correct tempature. In fact Our friend sent hers back she had ordered mediium rare and it came out well done. The waitress couldnt rememeber who ordered what at any point of the meal from beginning to eat. Steak knives were brought out about 15 minutes afte recieveing our entrees. The Side dishes came out wrong and far time after the entree as well. Over all from start to finish we were there for about 3 hours, and all of that time was spent wating for drink refills and food. We got the attention of the manager and brought up a few points, he apologized and asked if he could get us anything, our friend wanted a refill of his beer, 45 minutes later still no beer. We then had to asked our waitress. so add another 20 minutes to that time. After eating the sub par meal she asked what we would like for dessert, options were: chocolate cake, pumpkin pie, and sweet potato pi...is this a diner? we all opted for the chocolate cake....she explained to us it is served warm. About 25 minutes later they came out...not even warm or cold just felt like they had been sitting on the counter in the kitchen all day. It was the worst piece of cake Ive had in my life. My boyfriend who loves choclate cake coulnt even bare to eat more then a bite. She also never offered us the tea or coffee. now at about midnight she brings us the check. I have been in the resturant business for a long time, I can not see this place even prospering with the way its gonig right now. Terrible service, Slow serivce (again on a not busy night there was only one other table there) terrible food and way over priced. You can get a better meal at any chain resturant. And I dont even eat at chain restaurants. You could literally have a better meal at McDonalds. What A WASTE OF 300$ never never never again.

But then my husband said he was in the mood for a good steak so we started to call around to the usual places in Bergen...we could get in -- but only after 9 PM.  Then he remembered reading a review about this place in the 201 Magazine's 2011 restaurant guide.   We decided to give it a try.  From the valet parking to the attentive wait staff and owner visit tableside - and most notably - to the unbelievably delicious Flintstone ribeye for two - this place was, we agreed, the best steak house we had ever visited. (to be specific it was better than Ruth Chris', Sparks, Shula's, Luger's, Van's and Capital Grille - and definitiely more convenient to get to.) The presentation of the steak options was dramatic -- saran wrap covered cuts are brought out for review. We learned about the aging process and the flavor offered by bone in versus bone out cuts.   It was tough to decide but we went with the bone in rib eye giant - medium rare.  Lightly seasoned with just an awesome hint of Kosher salt and pepper, the steak melted like butter in our mouthes and the creamed spinach and the whipped sweet potatoes were an amazing complement.  Although the wine list was good, we let the meat do the talking this time and we were not disappointed.  Not inexpensive but the experience was completely worth it.
