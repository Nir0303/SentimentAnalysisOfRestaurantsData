Cash only Dive Bar!!  If you love dives bars then you will love Joannies located in Old Town Murrieta!  Good stiff drinks, pool, juke box, local characters, and great atmosphere is all at Joannies.  There is an ATM located on site in case you roll in without any cash.  The bartenders are all great and occasionally they even supply some appetizers or snacks with money out of their own pocket.  \n\nAnytime of the day or night there is always some inside ready to start a conversation about whatever the topic of the day is.  Also, take your drivers license with you.  You might just win something!!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-15T14:31:41-0400", "location_id": "6650674", "id": "205724224", "user": {"username": "Wiley12", "user_location": {"name": "Menifee, California", "id": "32703"}}}]}
