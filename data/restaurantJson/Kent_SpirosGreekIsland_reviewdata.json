The next time in, we might just order two Calamari's appetizer's and wine and call it good. The only issue was the baked halibut was a bit overcooked but it had excellent flavor and texture. We will return soon. Also heard the lunch specials are the best.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-02T07:02:41-0500", "location_id": "540306", "id": "246998774", "user": {"username": "Robusto1973", "user_location": {"name": "Auburn, Washington", "id": "30274"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Best GREEK food in South King County", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58537-d540306-r237864594-m11068-Spiros_Greek_Island-Kent_Washington.html#review237864594", "text": "You will not find a better place to get GREEK food, not Mediterranean food, in all of South King County.

Apparently my specific description of the nastiness found within this restaurant falls into the description of health code violations so I'll be general. There were gnats in the salad, sewer flies landing on us, spoiled lamb in my souvlaki - but since I don't want this removed I will say I cannot prove that the violent case of puking that ensued hours after eating here was due to their food. Despite that, I would still not recommend eating here unless you really enjoy projectile vomiting. I hadn't eaten ANYTHING else that day other than some dry cereal (no milk) so I believe there is a relationship between eating here and throwing up, but I can't prove it, just a \"gut\" feeling...ha ha ha.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-12T19:42:51-0400", "location_id": "540306", "id": "234032061", "user": {"username": "SilenceDogood01", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
