We arrived around 9:30P.M. The good thing was that they sat us immediately as it was not busy at all. Only 1 other table besides our party of 7. The food came out quickly and it was hot, another plus for them.Now that's the only good I can say. Our server clearly did NOT want to be there. She and 3 other woman who worked  there were standing nearby and speaking loudly in Chinese, even talking over us. We could not enjoy much conversation because of them, but I would have been willing to overlook this, had the other part of the service been okay. My 17 year old son asked for ketchup and my husband also asked for it and it was not brought to us. I sent my son up to the counter to ask once again and he finally got it. When the to-go boxes and the bill came, I had to answer my cell phone. It was 10:05 at this point, still not quite closing-time. I understand that employees want to get out on time and go home, but what happened next is BEYOND RUDE and INEXCUSABLE. The server started packing up my children's food and when she came to me, she interrupted my phone conversation and asked if I was finished. I put my hand up to indicate that I would be with her soon because I wanted to pack my OWN food. She rudely ripped open a to-go box and started packing my food. She also took my son's food and dumped it into the box that had my food! Then, she grabbed my eggroll with her BARE HANDS and shoved it into the box. I was in shock and disbelief. I told my husband that I felt rushed and rudely treated and he told me that she put my son's sesame chicken in with her bare hands too. I paid and we left. I called and asked for  management and the woman who had served me told me to come back and she will give me another eggroll. Really? She then told me she was sorry and not to be upset because her hands were clean! This is completely UNSANITARY! My husband manages a grocery store and had this happened, disciplinary action would be taken. I tried to explain this concept to the woman, but she kept insisting her hands were clean and telling me to come get another eggroll and that she would give me 5 more pieces of sesame chicken. We will NEVER go back and we have been customers since 1995!
