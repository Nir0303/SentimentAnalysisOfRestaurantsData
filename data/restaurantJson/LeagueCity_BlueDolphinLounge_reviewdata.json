It is located on a busy street in a run down strip center. If you drive by it you will miss it. Sure, it has pool tables and shuffleboard tables to play if you wish. And, it has a bar that serves beer and wine.....at least when we went a couple of years ago. This is a smoky bar that is a little rundown. We just decided not to go back there again. Lots of people would like this place because people are so different.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-07T10:01:02-0400", "location_id": "4984894", "id": "415798042", "user": {"username": "Gene W", "user_location": {"name": "Clear Lake, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Once burned twice shy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56144-d4984894-r356627290-m11068-Blue_Dolphin_Lounge-League_City_Texas.html#review356627290", "text": "Granted it has been a long time ago, well before the April 2015 that Tripadvisor will allow, and if it hadn't popped up I wouldn't even have thought of it. It is/was a nasty smelly skanky bar that my co-workers asked me to join them for a beer or wine. At that time, the waitress said they didn't serve wine, that I would have to bring my own. So the next time I did. The waitress took it and opened it and poured it in glasses for us then the bartender started screaming at us because it is against the law like it was our idea. I just followed directions from the staff. This was certainly not a place high on my list to hang out by any means but the way the misinformation was handled sealed it for me.
