This restaurant is popular with the locals and the courthouse crowd.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-17T12:59:05-0500", "location_id": "668609", "id": "348652336", "user": {"username": "CJTravelerTexas", "user_location": {"name": "Texas", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Must visit!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55543-d668609-r347593139-m11068-Longhorn_Tavern_Steak_House-Bryan_Texas.html#review347593139", "text": "Very good food! Decent price! Great atmosphere. A little off the beaten path but was a very good adventure!  We walked from the Lasalle motel. The place was packed when we arrived.
