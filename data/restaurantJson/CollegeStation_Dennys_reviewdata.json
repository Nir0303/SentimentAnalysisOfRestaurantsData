Something I don't want to hear while eating is the word \"fart\", no matter what comes before it.\n\nAfter finishing my meal, I had to wait another 5 minutes to get the check, and yet another 5 minutes for a cashier to come by the front so I could pay.  I seriously thought of bolting without pay since staff was nowhere around.\n\nNeedless to say, I was late for work.\n\nFood was okay, service was pretty inattentive, and slow.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-07-16T05:52:57-0400", "location_id": "471354", "id": "167783005", "user": {"username": "Gideon_Krasmanic", "user_location": {"name": "San Antonio, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-06", "title": "Great place, great service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55649-d471354-r165378148-m11068-Denny_s-College_Station_Texas.html#review165378148", "text": "We go for breakfast at least once a week at this Denny's.
