I said hello with a smile on my face and the person behind the counter barely acknowledged me.  I was the only customer at the counter.  It took her a minute or two to finish what she was doing (looked like she was tidying up) to finally ask me what I want.  I ordered and then mentioned that I was across the street on Sunday morning and saw so many people trying to go to this place but it was closed and asked why they don't open on Sunday.  The woman behind the counter kind of snapped at me \"Because we don't\" and really seemed like I was bothering her rather then trying to be a customer.   At that time, the person I assume was the owner comes into the room and is on a tirade about how angry she was because some customer spilled coffee without telling anyone and people were tracking it on her floor.  She was really angry and loud.  I would never ever go there again.

Pros: Cute shop and really good baked goods. Cons: Pricey everything, some staff not friendly and coffee not good. I've tried several different kinds (including lattes, espresso, etc.) and it never tastes good. I think it may be the brand they use. Not sure if this has changed since I've been in... but would love for them to sell used books too (instead of all new) and help their local/crunchy vibe. Bottom line: I need good coffee and fun/nice staff. Love the atmosphere so if those could be worked on, I could def become a regular. *Side note, the creamer had turned bad, and when I brought it (my coffee with curdled creamer) back to the front, they apologized, switched the creamer out without offering to give me a new coffee.
