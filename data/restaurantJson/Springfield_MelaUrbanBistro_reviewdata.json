It's indoor floorplan combines modern decor with plenty of private spaces - even has a trendy metal ring curtain to surround one area for private groups.  Wine selection is good for Clark County and the bar sits off to the side and a bit away from the general seating area.  It's outdoor patio sits raised about neck-high off of the ground and faces some of the famous landmarks and architecture of Springfield.  Un Mundo Cafe' is just across the street as well as many other little shops and things to walk past.  Oh, and the hotel has several large, semi-secluded lounge sections right up next to the bistro which provided a great place to chat/relax while waiting for a table and a great spot to camp at whenever the weather was too bad to walk around outdoors.\n\nNow the food, well, average I'd say.  Prices are what you'd expect for a yuppy magnet or anything labeled \"urban\" to mean \"modern and hip\".  In Springfield, locals know that \"urban\" in this town is not usually synonymous with those terms.  Anyway, order whatever off of the menu and expect not to be disappointed but not thrilled either.  I'd go for the service alone actually.\n\nOh, speaking of service - astoundingly good.  John is the friendliest, most competent waiter that I have encountered in years.

The service is pretty good when the restaurant is half full but be warned that they do not handle large crowds well - and there is ALWAYS a much longer wait for everything - not sure if they are short staffed or the kitchen can't handle it. We've only experienced this once, and complained because we like the place on the whole.

Served \"family style,\" it all began with delightful coconut crusted shrimp with a delightful sauce; we asked for seconds and it came within minutes.  Service was prompt and friendly. The man course was prime rib with horseradish, lamb kabobs with mint sauce, and sliced ham. Several veggies and three different deserts rounded out the dinner.  My grandsons asked for more of many things including  small strawberry pies or tarts.  The food was well prepared, and when someone wanted more of anything, it was provided. A wonderful holiday meal and an even more meaningful family meal.

Our reservation was at 6.15.  Everybody was in high spirits, and we were pleasantly surprised when we were shown to our table for nine.  Very nicely done and in a great location.  At that time, the dining room wasn't crowded... just starting to fill up.  \n\nOur  waitress was very slow to take our order for drinks, and I was thinking it wasn't a good sign.  We got our drinks at 7.05!  The waitress finally took our orders and we got our salads at 7.25, and then I knew we were never going to make it.  I told the waitress we had an 8:00 show, and she pretty much told me so did everyone else in the place and she didn't seem like she much cared.  After that, every time she would come out of the kitchen, she wouldn't look at our table.  \n\nAt 7.35, a member of our party got up and asked somebody to check on our meals.  We were told that meal orders are taken in the order they are received.  Well, we were definitely not the last people to arrive in the dining room; so if what he said was true, then our waitress didn't put our orders in until much later than after we have her our orders.  \n\nAt 7:40, someone other than our waitress came out and said our food was under the warming dishes and would be right out.  We asked her for some takeout boxes at that point.  There was ONE person left in the dining room.  \n\nAt 7.42, the food arrived with the takeout boxes and we asked for the check.  We talked to somebody else we could nab, coming out of the kitchen, and he pretty much said it wasn't their fault.  He said they take the orders as they come in - first come, first served - and they need about an hour and a half to two hours before a show.  Isn't that what we did?  And we were not the last people to place our orders.  I will say the food was great.  but I bolted it down so fast, I'm not sure.\n\nAt 7.50, another member of our party got up and stood by the kitchen door and told them if we didn't get our bills, we were leaving without paying.  At 7.55, she finally rolled out with the bills and said she couldn't take off anything, couldn't take off the gratuity, wasn't their fault.  We rushed across the street and into Kuss and the doors were locked.  We found a side door and went in about 8.07.  \n\nI understand a restaurant can be busy.  But, it seemed as though nobody really cared, and nobody could even mouth a simple apology about the late service.  We weren't looking for free meals, but removing the gratuity or giving us some coupons for our next visit would have at least let us think they cared about us as customers.  \n\nThey apparently have so much business, they don't care about their customers.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-03-09T04:31:25-0400", "location_id": "539576", "id": "196724657", "user": {"username": "m k", "user_location": {"name": "Sidney, Ohio", "id": "50976"}}}]}
