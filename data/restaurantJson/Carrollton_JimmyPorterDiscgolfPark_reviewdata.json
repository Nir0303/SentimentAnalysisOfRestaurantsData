Saw many people playing there over the last couple days, and it looks like it could take a few hours to play a round.  The course is next to the Purple Trail so if you are walking along the trail you can see people playing.  Its along a creek so there will be a lot of water hazards.  The markings for where to throw and where the 'holes' are seem clear.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-01T15:41:06-0500", "location_id": "9710287", "id": "336522819", "user": {"username": "Don P", "user_location": {"name": "Dallas, Texas, United States", "id": null}}}]}
