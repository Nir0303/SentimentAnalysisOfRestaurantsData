The burgers are nostalgic cooked just right. Daily specials for breakfast, lunch or dinner are the best choice and prices are still the best deal around. Seating can be a wait unless you don't mind sitting at a large table with others, which you will be made to feel welcome to the area. I would bet that many deals and conversations are worked out over the coffee that is poured to keep your cup topped off every few minutes.
