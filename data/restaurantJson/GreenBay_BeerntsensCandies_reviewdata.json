Here were our list of troubles; first, where is the candy!? The majority of the store is filled with overpriced Packers collectables, wine, and other various things. Yes, there is the display case filled with homemade (I think homemade) goodies, but that is about IT. Its not the cozy and homey candystore feel you expect. Its actually quite confusing and empty feeling. Next, it was SUPER quiet. I felt like we were in a library and couldnt talk. No music, no background kitchen noise, nothing. Our two daughters were in there having fun and looking at what candy there was and the employee behind the counter couldnt have cared less. She didnt smile, offer samples, didnt SPEAK at all. We gave our girls their own allowances for vacation so they paid seperately every where they went. Nobody else, anywhere seemed to care. This particular employee acted SUPER annoyed that she had to weigh and ring their purchases seperately. If you dont like kids or dealing with them, you probably shouldnt work the register at a candy store. We would have liked to spend more time there and sample some things and buy \"grown up\" chocolates. But again, we were never asked and we wanted to get out of that awkward and quiet situation as FAST as possible.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-05T10:15:53-0400", "location_id": "3694383", "id": "219800954", "user": {"username": "Ginfam", "user_location": {"name": "West Liberty, Iowa", "id": "38521"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-10", "title": "Lots of Hand Made Yum!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59929-d3694383-r183587355-m11068-Beerntsen_s_Candies-Green_Bay_Wisconsin.html#review183587355", "text": "Stopped in after a day on the town and from the moment we walked in the door, the wonderful smell of candy and chocolate told me I was going to be in trouble.
