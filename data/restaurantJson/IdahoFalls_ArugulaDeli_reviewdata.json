The Tuscan Chicken sandwich is....brilliant perfection. You aren't giving up anything with the wonderfully taste-and-tummy satisfying quinoa salad with balsamic dressing. I really can't choose between the two on any given day. My friend had the shrimp quesadillas and said they were divine. The French dip is also delicious, and I'd take that any time, though the Tuscan chicken or quinoa salad are my faves. They are in a wonderful location, right off of the charming down town district of Idaho Falls. \nThe owner is very nice, and the staff are very personable and friendly when you can get their attention. They are successful enough during lunch to hire a table busser (who should also be able to run food), which they desperately need to do. They are grossly understaffed for the lunch crowd they pull in. We sat at a table for 45 minutes without even getting water. I finally went to the counter and asked for it myself. That got the attention of the server, who finally showed up. The staff needs trained on time management (doing more than one thing at a time, like bringing food to one table and turning around and taking an order from a different table on the same trip across the restaurant). They were apologetic and nice and the freshly made food is perfect, but that didn't quite make up for the 2 hours spent there for lunch making us miss or be late for other commitments. This isn't a one time thing. It's every. Single. Time. Consistently best lunch food in town. Consistently slowest service in town.  I had to give overall of 3, which is regrettable.

There are a lot of good places, but the food served here at Arugula is done with pride. Concerning the food, every detail is thought out. First the salad is a mix of fresh green leaf and red lettuce. The Italian dressing was outstanding. Shaved carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes come with the leaves. The Tuscan sandwich has sauteed onions, chopped peppers, tomatoes, sliced chicken breast and a green paste-sauce. Time was put into my one, single, sandwich - and everyone else's too. What is the pureed goodness on this sandwich? My wife got the chivito sandwich: strips of thinly sliced, spiced meat, egg, puree sauce, gooey cheese (mozz.?) just a tremendous taste.  The bread on both sandwiches was a thinner, deliciously, crusty bread. Carrot cake, again, completely original, chocolate bottom, separated by cream, carrot on top with flecks of chocolate. The cook is making creations, not heating up crappy food off a truck.   The restaurant is in an old school. So the setting isn't great, no dividers between tables, but who cares with food like this?! Two people, sandwiches and carrot cake $35. When I took the pics of food and the kitchen, you could tell, he was just proud - and he should be!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-06T12:51:57-0500", "location_id": "6956895", "id": "353415691", "user": {"username": "Steveage", "user_location": {"name": "Rexburg, Idaho", "id": "35583"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "The best salad and sandwich", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35489-d6956895-r352755087-m11068-Arugula_Deli-Idaho_Falls_Idaho.html#review352755087", "text": "We stopped at Arugula to see if it was as good as people say, and it certainly was!
