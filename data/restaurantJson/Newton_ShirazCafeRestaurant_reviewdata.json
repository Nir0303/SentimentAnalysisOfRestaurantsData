When we walked in and asked for a table for six, the waiter said \"Okay, about 20 minutes wait\". We all stood there, stunned. There was literally 2 tables taken and about 10 tables open. So when I told her why can't we be seated in one of the ten tables, she said, \"Okay, let me check\". About five minutes later, she finally gave us a table. This was before we even sat down!\n       We all shared three beef and chicken combo platters which tasted like they were frozen, then microwaved. We all got stomach cramps later. The only food that seemed fresh and tasted somewhat OK was the bread. The appetizers were average and the drinks were okay. Also way overpriced. All in all, I will never come back. Bad food, poor service, for overpriced food, is the perfect combo to a bad meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-06-30T17:58:29-0400", "location_id": "931180", "id": "133138005", "user": {"username": "mikegol", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}]}
