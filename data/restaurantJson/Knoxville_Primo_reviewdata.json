The menu seems very limited at this time, possibly due to the new chef.  Obviously, this is a place to go for very special occasions when you want a romantic setting and to drink alcoholic beverages.  As for the food, I was not all that impressed.  I had calamari, which was actually very good, and the sauce had a little kick to it.  I also had the house Caesar salad, but the dressing was not very flavorful.  One friend had the house salad and she said it was drowning in the Italian dressing and she could not eat it.  Two others had the Chicken Marsala and they said it was good, just not a lot for the money.  Another had the filet entr\u00e9e.  She said it was very tasty and it came with two sides.  There was a large group there at the tables next to us for a 15 year old's birthday.  There was about 20+ of them, and they were extremely loud, so it took away from our hopes of a nice quiet evening.  The offer valet parking for $6.

We made reservations (as per advise of other reviewers), and were psyched to \"taste the pictures\" we'd been swapping vial email for the past few weeks.\n\nWe arrived on time for our 8pm reservation, and were told there was a slight wait.  We were happy to sit at the bar and order a few drinks before dinner, and the hostess told us it would be \"about 10-15\" minutes for a table to open up.  We saw great seats at the front window and asked to be seated in a specific area, and the hostess explained there were two couples ahead of us for that particular area.\n\nI really wanted the great view of the city, so I was content to wait the 10-15 minutes.  As I watched a first, and a second couple get seated in the section we'd requested, I got excited knowing we were next.  After almost 30 minutes the hostess came to get us...and walked us to the opposite side of the restaurant.  Sure, it was a table near the window, but it wasn't the seating we'd been promised and had waited an extra 30 minutes to sit in.\n\nAt the EXACT same moment we were being seated, a table from the section we'd requested left, so I had my BFF pick up her drink and move to the other table.  I purposefully stood next to the table we'd requested until someone walked over and said, \"Oh. Did you want this table?\" \n\nWhen we were finally seated, I was excited to see the menu, and to ask the waiter about one of the dishes I'd seen coming out of the kitchen while waiting at the bar.  Our server had approximately five (5) tables in his section (with only 2 patrons per table).  We asked about the dish a couple two tables down had, and the server couldn't remember what it was.  We tried to describe it, and he couldn't definitely figure it out.  Rather than go check the ticket (or even just KNOW since he only had five tables and the couple was still eating), he suggested a different dish that we ended up ordering.\n\nI will absolutely give Primo credit for getting the food to the table quickly.  That, and the bartenders (great drinks!), were the only highlights to my experience that evening. \n\nThe pasta was just okay...honestly, a little bland.  Thinking I'd just spice it up with a little salt and fresh-cracked pepper, I looked around for our server.  He was incredibly busy with the other four tables.  So busy, in fact, that in the course of the next 10-15 minutes he passed by our table not once, not twice, not thrice...but FOUR times without asking about our food or if we needed anything.  \n\nAs politely as possible I explained that I'd only felt my initial taste of the pasta was \"just okay,\" but might have been improved if I'd gotten salt and the offer of fresh-cracked pepper (come on, it's a \"primo\" pasta restaurant!) before my food got cold.  My BFF and I were splitting an entr\u00e9e, and she ate a small portion of the pasta before just sitting back to enjoy the cocktails.  I absolutely wasn't in the mood to eat (and honestly, was fuming a little), so we just sent 3/4 of the pasta back to the kitchen and requested the check.\n\nOur server was visibly confused as to my response to the food and service, but he recovered well and offered an apology for our experience.  I was thankful when the check came to the table that the server was gracious enough to comp the meal for the evening, leaving us with only our bar tab to resolve.\n\nWill I go to Knoxville again? Absolutely.  It's a great city with amazing food, music, and booze galore.  Will I go to Primo again? Meh.\n\nHonestly, I probably would have given this place a \"2\" if I'd had to pay and tip for the meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-29T18:14:45-0400", "location_id": "10028140", "id": "412520479", "user": {"username": "hymcgee", "user_location": {"name": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "id": "60993"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Best dinner in Knoxville", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55138-d10028140-r411515243-m11068-Primo-Knoxville_Tennessee.html#review411515243", "text": "Had a marvelous meal, great view, good wine.
