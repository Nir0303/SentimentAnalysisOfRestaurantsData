Since I was very hungry, I ordered borscht while I was waiting. Borscht was good, but $10 for the small cup it is too much. At least offer some garlic bread with it, instead of 2 small pieces of plain bread. The red price for this cup of soup with 2 pieces of bread is $5, not $10! So, together one cup of borscht and chicken kiev cost me more than $30. With the tax and tip it was over $35. I am sure it is too much for a lunch.

She has repurposed the lovely wood fence into tables.  Modern art adorns the walls of this cozy spot.  Fresh ingredients and an interesting European and Central Asian menu are a standout.  I had a delicious lamb salad which they prepared to my taste, rare, with a sweet chili dressing.  My friend had a Nicoise salad which was equally delicious.
