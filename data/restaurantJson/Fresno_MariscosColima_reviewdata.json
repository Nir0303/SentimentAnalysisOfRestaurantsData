Upon entrance, we were promptly seated and welcomed with a bowl of tortillas and salsa.  The waitress was friendly and the food arrived in small doses (unlike most restaurants where they serve everyone\u2019s order at the same time).  I ordered the taco salad with shrimp (which had generous portions), it was very good.  The kids had burritos and my husband ordered fish tacos.  We also ordered horchata, which really refreshed our thirst.  Overall the food was tasty and the prices were reasonable.
