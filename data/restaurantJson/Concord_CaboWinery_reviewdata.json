Some wineries give you the tasting glasses and Cabo's also gives you your wine tasting glasses. Our host was pleasant, funny and a wealth of knowledge about the wines they had to serve. A nice surprise is you get to choose the wines you want to taste instead of being given a set of standard wines. But I'm not done yet! Lots of cute shopping areas, and once a month they have a wine tasting and painting offered to anyone that wants to sign up for it.

It is located in an old building on Union Street in downtown Concord.  We did a wine tasting with one of the owners.  They offer over 70 wines  ranging from dry to sweet.  We concentrated on the dry wines.  Although some of the wines are a bit immature, we found several that we could definitely enjoy.  We felt that several of the wines could benefit from oak barrel (not chips) aging.  However, we were told that, because of limits and regulations imposed by local agencies, they are very limited in their methods of aging - they use a few tanks and the rest is aged in glass - a new one for us. We liked their Merlot and their blend called Trio.  Their filtered Malbec is quite nice (they also have a non-filtered and it is not as smooth).  While it is worth a visit if you happen to be in the area, and we recommend you do, we look forward to seeing how this business and their wines develop and over the next couple of years.  We hope they find an alternative location where they can properly age their wines in barrels without limitations.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-19T09:40:10-0400", "location_id": "8837200", "id": "356811101", "user": {"username": "Genie M", "user_location": {"name": "Matthews, North Carolina", "id": "49330"}}}]}
