It has chopped onions, cilantro, cucumbers, served with saltines or Mexican tortilla tostadas plain. The campechana is the shrimp cocktail with squid, scallops, abulon, it is a must if you like seafood and Mexican simply delicioso!!! Its a small hole in the wall and the area looks shady but is safe, as a local I visit here 3-8 times a year.
