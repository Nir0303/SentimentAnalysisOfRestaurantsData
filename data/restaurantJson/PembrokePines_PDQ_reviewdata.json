There, I said it.   My fast food choice is limited and I tend to favor Chick-Fil-A.  Was looking forward to trying out PDQ and this is my second time for lunch.  I started by ordering just their Cali Club Sandwich and was impressed.  Went back and ordered the same but meal.  Fries are just okay.  Both orders were drive thru which was easy.  Staff Friendly.  But the quality of the chicken is delicious.  You can tell it is fresh chicken.
