We had talked to staff at the Tennis Center before we booked our two week stay in Deerfield Beach in an effort to determine if this place would be a good resource for us. It sounded pretty good on the phone, but the reality was even better!  \n\nThere are six lighted courts laid out in a two-court and a four-court configuration. Each is in fine condition, having been resurfaced recently. The facility is in Pioneer Park, across from City Hall. In addition to the courts, there are several ballfields here. There are two courtside water fountains. Three of the courts have a covered bench beside them, and there are several off-court tables under palm tree shade. There is a $5 PP fee to play, but that fee enables you to play all day, assuming there is a court available. They clearly take their tennis seriously here - making it a pleasure for us. \n\nReservations can be made, yet we did not need them. We showed up in late morning every day; courts were always available. Played for as long as we desired. Pro shop staff explained that the courts are rarely busy enough to need a reservation. Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. The proshop is small, yet reportedly can handle restringing, arrange lessons and drills, sells equipment, etc. It includes changing rooms/bathrooms with showers for men and women. There's also a beverage vending machine.\n\nWe recommend this place highly, but with one serious caveat. We were halfway through our last match (on one of the four courts) when some guy started yelling incessantly.  Fencing and netting prevented us from seeing him, but although he was 100 feet away giving a lesson on another court we could hear every word he squawked. Asked the proshop staff to ask him to quiet down, and was told that she could not because he was the head professional - and her boss. Told her we'd mention him in this review instead. \"Hey, loudmouth - show some respect for fellow players!\"", "helpful_votes": "8", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-02-20T09:57:08-0500", "location_id": "7725486", "id": "255468957", "user": {"username": "TrueBob", "user_location": {"name": "Pennsylvania", "id": "28959"}}}]}
