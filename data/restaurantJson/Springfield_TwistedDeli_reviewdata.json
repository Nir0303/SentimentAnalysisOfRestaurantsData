It was siracja and lemon with corn and other vegis.  It is hard to find good vegan so I always use it to judge. It was a very good soup and you could not tell it was vegan.The sandwich I had was good, about a 7-1/2. The service was a 10, they are very friendly. Their coffee is coffee flavored as opposed to what those expensive coffee places serve.

What made it bad was the long line to order, and to finally  receive  the food. The  staff seemed slow and inexperienced, possibly  even understaffed for that time of day. I went on a Friday  afternoon  so it was definitely  busy. Plus its located on  4th and  South Grand so its to be expected. The  prices were reasonable, and  the restaurant  itself was clean; the  staff was friendly  enough  for  being  busy and  short staffed. I  had Ben's Bourbon steak and cheese on a Flatbread that was good and filling, real steak.  The Flatbread  was actually  a  pita bread so it looked like a gyro sandwich but with diced beef and  bourbon  sauce. The cinnamon  roll was devine I  recommend  this, if you  come here the cream cheese  icing  came on the side and was slightly  sweet not too much but perfect . I also sampled the  pineapple  cookies ( awesome) and  the brownie ( good). I  think  this  place is fairly  new too so that may explain  the  inexperience of the staff. I  recommend  going  at a slow  time and day.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-26T10:06:59-0400", "location_id": "10509552", "id": "411097381", "user": {"username": "Krystal A", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Don't miss their cinnamon rolls!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60887-d10509552-r410716567-m11068-Twisted_Deli-Springfield_Illinois.html#review410716567", "text": "Best and biggest cinnamon rolls ever.
