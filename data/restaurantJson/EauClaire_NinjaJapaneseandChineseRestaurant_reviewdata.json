The staff have been friendly, quick and accurate in our orders. The prices are amazingly low - especially at lunch where you can get a salad and two rolls for $9.00; a pot of tea is $1.00. I really like the decor of the restaurant which is modern and trendy, yet cozy and comfortable in the booths. I highly recommend this restaurant; I will be back many times. This may not be a \"five star restaurant\", but for the kind of restaurant it means to be, it succeeds on all counts.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-23T13:27:37-0400", "location_id": "10067415", "id": "357907210", "user": {"username": "TravelinJabbo", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Ask what they make in house", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59843-d10067415-r355781890-m11068-Ninja_Japanese_and_Chinese_Restaurant-Eau_Claire_Wisconsin.html#review355781890", "text": "Many items (what they weren't out of) tasted like they were from a food distributor.
