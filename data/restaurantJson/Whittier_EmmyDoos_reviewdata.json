We visited it the first time with our kids and grandkids at the beginning of April and loved everything about it.  Pick out your fresh warm cookies and 2 scoops of icecream and you have your very own icecream sandwich.  The price is amazing for all you get. . .I ended up with one scoop because 2 was too much.  Wonderful fun place for the whole family.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-04-16T17:04:12-0400", "location_id": "4818654", "id": "201478131", "user": {"username": "Rosetta4352", "user_location": {"name": "Whittier, California", "id": "33268"}}}]}
