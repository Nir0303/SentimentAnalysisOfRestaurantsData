The Toppings they have at the condiments counter are great including he pickled onions .  But the items that sealed the sea for me are their pinto beans. My grandmother was Mexican-American and made them from scratch when I was a kid - they were incredible and this restaurants pinto beans are about as close as any place could come to her bean perfection.  Drop some of those pickled onions in and they are the ultimate comfort food!  Staff is always friendly and polite and the place is always spotless- as opposed to many of the other taco places.  You can't go wrong here. And it's very reasonably priced as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-15T13:16:13-0400", "location_id": "841646", "id": "355804633", "user": {"username": "studiofun", "user_location": {"name": "Laguna Beach, California", "id": "32588"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "The shrimp tacos are the best,", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32590-d841646-r353735913-m11068-Baja_Fish_Tacos-Laguna_Niguel_California.html#review353735913", "text": "I've been going to BFT for at least 7 years and it is always good.
