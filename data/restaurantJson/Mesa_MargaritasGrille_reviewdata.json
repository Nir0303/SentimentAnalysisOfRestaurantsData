Happy Hour specials were fine if you like domestic beer, and I honestly didn't see a cheap price for the appetizers we ordered. Will have to return and try their regular menu, but not in any hurry, as I wasn't truly impressed.

We had a mixed experience. My husband was really pleased with his Cadillac Margarita and Shrimp Chile Relleno, which is the basis for my favorable rating. I knew my meal would be a challenge since I can't have aged cheese, beans or citrus (migraine triggers for me), so all Mexican food is problematic for me. I do like shrimp so the waiter suggested shrimp tacos. When my tacos came, I was disappointed to find them drenched in hot sauce. Since I've not had much Mexican food in many years, I'm not used to the hot sauce and don't really enjoy the mouth on fire feeling it gives. In fact, the burning sensation was so intense, I couldn't really taste anything else. For what it's worth, I think there were a total of 4 shrimp on the two tacos, two apiece. That may be normal for shrimp tacos, but it was disappointing to me. I got only rice as a side (no beans, right), and that seemed flavorless too, barely pinkish, not much but white rice there. Our server Alex was very nice and attentive, but I chose not to talk to him about the taco hot sauce. I imagine he would have offered a redo without the hot sauce, and since I didn't ask, I can't really hold that against the restaurant. I was still hungry when I finished picking through the tacos so I ordered the flan, which was fine and filling. It was quiet when we went since we chose to go early on a Saturday night so service was excellent, and we could talk easily. Given my limitations, I don't know that we will try them again. I'd say it was just not a good idea for us to choose a Mexican restaurant given my limitations. The alternative near the Arts Center was Thai, which is also problematic for me. The rating reflects my husband's opinion of his meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-08-17T14:17:27-0400", "location_id": "7126081", "id": "300431999", "user": {"username": "Truly B", "user_location": {"name": "Asheville, North Carolina", "id": "60742"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Great atmosphere, friendly service, good food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31281-d7126081-r291704878-m11068-Margaritas_Grille-Mesa_Arizona.html#review291704878", "text": "Came here for the first time for a business lunch.
