There is a rest room on the same level so you can take the little ones easily without having to go downstairs into the main dining room and there's a separate back entrance to the \"play area\" dining room right off the parking lot.  All the servers at our event were excellent and attentive.\nThe salads were huge, beautifully presented, varied and delicious, served with plenty of different dressings as well.  We couldn't finish all the salads so the staff packed them nicely to take home.\nThis was one of the most interesting restaurants I've ever been to and I'm looking forward to returning for an adult gathering to enjoy some of the house brews and Brazilian appetizers.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-02-04T11:56:00-0500", "location_id": "3973772", "id": "252644191", "user": {"username": "claireleefl", "user_location": {"name": "Winter Springs, Florida", "id": "34748"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Best lunch pizza and brew in the city!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33037-d3973772-r237294434-m11068-Pizza_Orgasmica-San_Rafael_Marin_County_California.html#review237294434", "text": "This is my Go-To eatery for pizza (2 toppings), salad (house or Caesars), and any brew on tap for $10.00.\nThe combination of the three food items (yes, beer is food) was XLNT!\nThe Porter was one of my top 3 favorite in house Porter.\nOoooo, they serve authentic Brazilian foods here too! \nMoms and dads, for your kids: 1 topping pizza, salad and soda for under $6.00; and a really cool play area for families!\nYes, they do have a happy hour, and yes, I will return later and report on their happy hour...", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-10-31T10:29:13-0400", "location_id": "3973772", "id": "237294434", "user": {"username": "ycnans coat", "user_location": {"name": "Manhattan Beach, California", "id": "32678"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Great pizza...but can you get a few more staff?", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33037-d3973772-r232575811-m11068-Pizza_Orgasmica-San_Rafael_Marin_County_California.html#review232575811", "text": "We love, love, love the pizza and the beer is excellent.
