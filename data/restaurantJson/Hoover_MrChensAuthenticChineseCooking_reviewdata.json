The place was busy and the wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed with comments about waiting for food and slow service. The plates coming out looked ok as far as I could tell. It took 25 minutes to get my order and 5 minutes or so to get back to my hotel. There were no utensils, napkins or sauce included (the sauce was on the counter). There is an option to order online.\n\nWhen I opened the bag, I was disappointed with the presentation.\nThey used a styrofoam box and included the small egg rolls in with the cooked food. Now everyone knows if you put fried food in an enclosure with other to food (especially in styrofoam) it steams the fried food (which is why every other chinese take-out I have ever had puts the egg rolls in a wax-type bag), so they were soggy. In the case of the Mongolian Beef the egg roll was swimming in a pool of meat sauce and inedible.\n\nThe Kung Pao Chicken was almost chopped meat - small pieces along with zucchini (really?) and mushrooms along with very small pieces of chinese red peppers which really don't test well when chewed, so there was a laborious task of finding all of these 2-3 cm  mines. Very salty. The sauce was spicy and peanuts crunchy - other than that is was far from this dish I have had in other places. The Egg Fried Rice - meh - kind of boring and a little oily - some small scrambled egg pieces, 4 carrot cubes and 3 peas\n\nThe Mongolian Beef was overwhelmingly onion tasting with a mixture of regular and green onions. The sauce was thin, slightly sweet.\n\nI really had a hard time deciding if this was terrible or poor. Since I was able to eat SOME of it I chose poor. I would not go back.

I usually stick to shrimp with vegetables and it was good. My husband had the Kung Pao chicken and he said it was really good. We both asked for the red chili paste to spice up both of our dishes. (Use sparingly because it is quite hot). We also ordered the seafood hot and sour soup and it was  delicious. I have read other reviews that say the food is not spicy or is bland. I learned by going to the Tuscaloosa restaurant that it is best to ask for the red chili to add to the dish yourself. I made the mistake of ordering shrimp with vegetables spicy! It was so spicy that I could not eat it. The manager brought me out another order and told me to ask for the chili next time. That is what we always do and our dishes are always spiced to our liking! The food and service were good. We will definitely return to try some of their other dishes.

Chinese, Mexican, Thai, and even Bar B Q. When it comes to Chinese or Mexican I tend to think you have to be dinning at a friends home in Shanghai or Mexico City. Then you may experience authentic cuisine unless that day they choose to show off their French. Mr. Chen's is very good and maybe very close to authentic but I have never dined in Shanghai so I have nothing to compare to. But when I want Chinese food this is the first place I think of so they do something right. I have had both lunch and dinner here several time and never been disappointed with the food or service. The prices are very reasonable the service is always quick and you get the feel of being in a Chinese restaurant on the mainland China. As a local place in Hoover which is a suburb of Birmingham the food stands out way above the other Chinese establishments, including the Red Pearl. One great thing is they have a very large parking lot so parking is never a problem. Staying downtown for a visit your drive would be about 15 minutes depending on traffic and the location is easy to find. It's located in a good area and I usually feel very safe when in this area of the city. The dinner menu offers more and interesting items but you can order dinner items off the usual lunch items. But the prices on the lunch menu are so reasonable and the food so good why spend more money. If you are a local resident or just visiting the city for a few days you will not be disappointed with Mr. Chen's Authentic Chinese.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-01T11:38:25-0500", "location_id": "2367656", "id": "246870138", "user": {"username": "Lawrence B", "user_location": {"name": "Birmingham, Alabama", "id": "30375"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Great Authentic Chinese Food with quick service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30615-d2367656-r246822882-m11068-Mr_Chen_s_Authentic_Chinese_Cooking-Hoover_Alabama.html#review246822882", "text": "Went with my daughter, who demanded it as one of her first places to go when she came home from overseas.
