I would recommend you order the soup or salad since they only give you one roll and I thought that was on the skimpy side. I would of preferred they offer two spring rolls each. Next, I ordered the green curry and it came with a side of jasmine rice. I thought the coconut broth was excellent and wasn't too spicy. The portions again I thought were a little bit on the small side. It was enough for me because I couldn't eat more than what they gave me, but maybe a grown man might need more to eat. My friend ordered the Thai fried rice with chicken and her portion was a little bigger than mine. Your meal also comes with soda, and I got diet coke.
