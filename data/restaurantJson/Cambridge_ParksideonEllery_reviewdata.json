David was an amazing host - I spoke with him by phone and email several times in advance of our visit and he could not have been more helpful. He went out of his way to make our stay easier, and was an incredibly gracious host. We stayed in the Cambridge room, which was great!  When you walk in, there is a lovely breakfast nook (surrounded by bookshelves), where we had our breakfast each morning. it was delivered via dumbwaiter, which was between the nook and the bedroom, and across from the bathroom. Everything was spotlessly clean, and although the bathroom wasn't huge, it was more than big enough for us. There are not toiletries provided, but there is a cache of supplies other guests have left, and we were close walking distance to stores and pharmacies if we needed anything. Closet and shelf space is very large, and the bed is a nice king (one of the issues about which David was so kind was replacing the feather comforter and pillows due to our allergies). The large windows let in light, a space heater provided extra warmth (which really wasn't needed, even on a cold Jan day), and there was also a desk for us to do a bit of work, and a sofa to sit and read. It felt large, light and airy. We were right next to the Cambridge Public Library, and only a short walk from Harvard Square and the T (on David's recommendation, we took the T to and from the airport and it was amazingly easy and quick - and free when boarded at the airport). Yes, breakfast is light, but that worked out perfectly for us. Each morning as we were getting ready, we had an early meal of english muffins, juice and coffee, and then a later brunch/lunch to get us through til dinner. If we had wanted, there was a fridge in the room and we could have easily brought fruit or snacks. David provides lots of little touches like glasses, corkscrew, sewing kit, iron, blowdryer, lint brush, umbrellas, etc... It is really a perfect location if you're visiting Harvard, but honestly, with the T so close, it is a great location for anywhere you are going in Cambridge/Boston.

The bathroom was simple, immaculate and equipped with lovely fixtures and linens.  David provided me with a great binder full of neighborhood maps, restaurant ideas, contacts for taxis, laundries, and anything else I might be needing - and - above and beyond all expectations, he even appeared in a moment of crisis, as if by magic, with a tub of wonderful toys for my great grandson who was visiting but having a momentarily difficult time.
