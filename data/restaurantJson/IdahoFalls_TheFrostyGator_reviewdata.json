Bathrooms are filthy, ugly cement floor with carpet glue still visible, angry staff, high prices, the once popular deck is never full anymore  and falling apart. No money seems to be put into the place. Not how it use to be, I wish we had the old gator back. Hopefully he sells it and someone puts some back into it.

Their fish tacos were one of the better items on their menu but they are by far not the best in town (Snake Bite takes first place and is right around the corner).  There are too many great places in Idaho Falls to eat where customer service, value, and quality of product are much greater than what the Frosty Gator offers.
