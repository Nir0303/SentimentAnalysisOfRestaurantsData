It is a little difficult to find, but it is well marked with signs once you park your car in the parking lot.\n\nWalk around to the back of the buildings and you will find a very pleasant little restaurant with inside or outside seating. If it's a nice day I highly recommend sitting outside with a beautiful view of the lake.\n\nAs others have said, it is a limited brunch menu. But what is served is very delicious and I am sure you can find something there that you like.\n\nTwo of us had the chicken salad with a side of coleslaw with a small piece of extremely delicious toasted bread. The servings are very large, I feel, for the price you pay, which was only $8.95. My other friend had lox and bagels and also shared a Belgium waffle. Again , the serving sizes were very abundant.  Our bill was only $41 for the three of us , which I felt was extremely reasonable.\n\nThe service was good, we were never rushed at all, and as we had each driven approximately 100 miles to meet up, we wanted to have time for a visit.\n\nIf you go to the Garden Bistro, be sure not to miss the gardens that are next to it. Take the time to walk through the lovely Gardens there on the lake or you will truly miss a magnificent setting. There is no charge for the gardens.\n\nI highly recommend the Garden Bistro for brunch.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-14T17:12:02-0500", "location_id": "2697064", "id": "437261361", "user": {"username": "JUDITH P", "user_location": {"name": "HUDSON, FL", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Nice Sunday Brunch by the lake", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34373-d2697064-r433645392-m11068-Garden_Bistro-Lakeland_Florida.html#review433645392", "text": "The brunch menu is limited but very good.
