We visited on a weeknight evening. Although there was still over an hour until closing the vibe was one of \"can't wait to go home.\" I had the basic burger and my husband had the barbecue bacon burger. We ordered onion rings as a starter. The onion rings tasted like they were frozen. They lacked flavor or seasoning in the coating. My husband's barbecue bacon burger had one spot of barbecue sauce the size of a nickel. I had to go to the counter ask for additional barbecue sauce. The buns on both sandwiches were over-sized for the burger and verged on staleness.  Both buns were served cold. The restaurant is billed as a 50's style diner. The decor fit the 50's period, but the food had none of the 50's flat top grill flavor. We seldom saw our server. Our bill had no prices or total, only a hand written listing of the items we ordered. When we went to the cashier to pay our bill we had to wait while he finished looking at his cell phone before he took our money. While he took our money he had an ongoing conversation with another employee.  Perhaps our experience would have been different if we visited for lunch. In their downtown location, lunch is probably their busiest part of the day.
