The decor was casual but tasteful and inviting. We wanted to try everything on the Happy Hour menu (specialty drinks as well as food items) AND their specials for the evening. However, since that wasn't possible I had a Grapefruit martini -- excellent; the others had craft beer and wine. Our food choices, which we shared, were: caesar salad; the 3 sampler sliders (pork belly, salmon, bacon cheeseburger); salmon quesadilla (out of this world);  special for the night, 4 cheese ravioli with sage butter sauce (also out of this world); steamed mussels in a marvelous broth; lovely dinner rolls to sop up the mussel broth.
