Friends & Family always said it was a must do. We ordered fried dumpling to start .  Probably the best we have ever had ! Next we had our Pho. I had rare beef and meatballs and my wife had the chicken. We like spicy and were disappointed in how bland the broth was. We added a little Sriracha & Hoisin and this helped. The beef, meatballs and chicken were tender back lacked taste. Don't know if we were expecting too much from the Pho. The restaurant was very clean and service was excellent .", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-17T11:36:29-0500", "location_id": "6213390", "id": "340770354", "user": {"username": "RonKathy_2011", "user_location": {"name": "Camden", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "10 minutes means 30", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30274-d6213390-r242643983-m11068-Pho_Thang_Long-Auburn_Washington.html#review242643983", "text": "We order our food to go at least once a month.

We locals call it Todd's (the owners name).  I have lunch here at least once a week.  Even more often when I'm feeling a little under the weather.  Pho does a sick person good.   I dont need a menu.  P1 medium.   Sometimes the gal will tell me what I get before I even tell her.  Not a pho fan?  The rest of the food is great too.  Highly recommend it.
