We had an early reservation made through Open Table.  We were seated upstairs in a dark and rather unattractive environment. There were several tables downstairs in a lighter and more appealing setting that remained open the entire time that we were there.  We had studied the menu on-line before deciding to dine there.  However, when we arrived and saw the menu on site, we saw that items listed in the online menu were no longer available on-site.  The server explained the menu had changed and had not been updated on-line. Really? This is not acceptable.\n\nWe ordered a charcuterie and cheese platter that had a rather average selection. There was no bread with the platter.  The presentation was almost haphazard, like something you would throw together at home.  The plate was too large for the amount of food.  This problem carried through to the main course.  My husband ordered one of the specials, lamb.  The meat was well seasoned. The portion of meat was large although about a third of it was fat.  There were almost no vegetables with the meat.   My sons had the salmon which they liked.  There was no salt or pepper on the table, however, which was another oversight.  I had the Korean barbecue which was the best dish of the four that we ordered.  The seasoning was excellent.\n\nI think this restaurant has the potential to be quite good.  However, at its current level of performance, it does not merit the price charged. We paid around $50 a person and for that amount, we could have been at Saint Jacques in Raleigh and had a much superior meal.  Maximillian's needs to amp up their game, get that website updated and improve their presentation skills.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "fkt2014, Owner at Maximillians Grill &amp; Wine Bar, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for the feedback.
