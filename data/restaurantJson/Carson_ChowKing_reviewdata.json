There was one cashier on duty during the busy lunch hour and I am not sure how many cooks but it took 20 minutes for us (3 people) to get our orders. There was about 6 people in line and there was no help at the counter. The cashier had to get the orders and prepare the food. There was another person taking out the garbage that looked like the manager on duty. The tables were messy and dirty and we had to wipe down and clean our own table if we wanted to sit down quickly. This is the dirtiest and lousiest service Chow King that we've ever visited. We have visited the Chow King restaurants in Las Vegas, San Diego, San Jose, and Los Angeles, and the franchise's name is being dragged down by this restaurant. I will never visit this restaurant again. I would travel to Los Angeles and eat there rather than eat at this location.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-10-23T08:39:26-0400", "location_id": "4479404", "id": "182100991", "user": {"username": "Mang Andres V", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}]}
