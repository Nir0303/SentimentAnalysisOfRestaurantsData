So, needing fuel also, decided to look for it and glad I did. The food is prepared fresh, tasty and with various sauces you can add. I chose the \"kebab\" combo and it didn't look like much, but it was very filling and would order again. Also, my friend had the  \"sharhma\" wrap; not sure if that is the correct spelling, but it is this large serving and is pictured behind the counter. The dressing or sauce is much like a \"ranch\".\nGreat place, will repeat if in the area!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-13T22:09:00-0400", "location_id": "4797084", "id": "205475139", "user": {"username": "willys6", "user_location": {"name": "Fairfield, California", "id": "32367"}}}]}
