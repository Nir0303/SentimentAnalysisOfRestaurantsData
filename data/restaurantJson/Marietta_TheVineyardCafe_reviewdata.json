There's a small menu in the window, but no real directions to the cafe itself.  I'd been meaning to go here for ages, but felt a little awkward about barging into the gift shop, and asking \"Where' the food?!\" It just seems....brazen. So here's the deal. Go into the Vineyard gift shop on West Park, facing the Square.The one with the beautiful bay windows on the second floor.  You will see a large staircase. Simply go up the stairs, and the lady at the counter will see that you are seated. \n\nThat's the hard part. Once found, this place is a gem.The building is old and atmospheric, with creaking wooden floors, and splendid views onto the Square from the giant bay windows.  They are only open for lunch, and serve mostly soups, salads, quiche and sandwiches. \n\nMy friend got quiche and soup and said it was very good, particularly her soup. My turkey and bacon sandwich on cranberry walnut bread was fresh and delicious. The Greek pasta salad on the side was a little oily on the tongue, probably from being refrigerated,  but hey, what's Greek without a good dose of olive oil, and it was still good. The red velvet cake truffles were moist and rich, and being two of them, were easy to share. Everything was very, very fresh from the greens on the sandwich to the bacon and turkey. Did I mention fresh? Fresh, fresh, and more fresh, which was a delight. \n\nService was very friendly, if a little spacey, but you can't fake friendly, which he certainly was, so he gets a pass. \n\nI can't believe I got a meal of this quality for under $9. If I could give extra stars for value, the Vineyard would rate them.  If the restaurant gods weren't so fickle, these guys would have a permanent waiting line. A little bit better signage would probably help. \n\nI'm kind of hoping I can talk her into making this a weekly thing.
