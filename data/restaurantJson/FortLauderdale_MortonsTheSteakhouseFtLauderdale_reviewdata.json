Go to Capital Grill; this place is awful.\n\nMy partner received a coupon via email for Morton's special $35 2-lb lobsters, so we decided to go.\n\nOur food:\n\nComplimentary Foccacia bread: Stale. No joke. You know how bread gets a little extra white inside when it starts to become stale? And it gets crusty? This had those white edges, and it was crusty, and they heated it up in the oven in an attempt to mask it. So dry it was like eating a puffy saltine cracker. I mean, how do you f- up bread? \n\nAppetizers: \"Tuna Tower\" I would not call a 3-story-tall building a \"tower.\" This thing stood a whopping 3\" tall, and only 1/3 of it was Tuna. The other 2/3 were made up of a crushed wasabi cracker and Mango salsa. I admit, it was delicious. But I was certainly expecting much more with the name \"Tuna Tower\" and for $18.50. Want an idea of the size of it? I think they used a 1-cup measuring cup as a mold for it. So, take out your 1-cup measuring cup: that's about the size. And while the chips served with it were delicious, there were not enough of them.\n\nOysters: 6 for $18. They didn't come with mignonette sauce. 3 of them weren't separated from the shell (they weren't shucked correctly), and 3 of them were sandy.\n\nDrinks: FYI, most of the cocktails are around $15.\n\nBaked potato: We split one. It was luke-warm, looked like it had been sitting under a heat-lamp for an hour, and cost $13. Most of the sides were out-of-the-can friendly: creamed corn; creamed spinach; mushrooms. I'm not sure if they come out of a can or not, but the sides available on the menu seemed un-creative, un-inspiring, and not worthy of their price tag. Can't believe we paid $13 for a baked potato.\n\nLobsters: The tails were over-cooked, claws tasted good, tamale inside was very liquidy, and not sure if they were 2-lbs.\n\nDessert: We skipped it because we were anticipating bland, over-priced dessert that had been sitting in a freezer all day.\n\nI gave 2 stars because it is a pretty dining room, the hostesses were amiable, and the server, while his demeanor was a bit informal for a high-end restaurant, worked hard and wanted us to be satisfied.\n\nUpon leaving, we passed a table where we noticed a lobster and baked potato that were noticeably larger than our's.\n\nIn the end, our bill was $180 including tip.
