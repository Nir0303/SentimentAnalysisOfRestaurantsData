On the tour we were served a peanut butter smoothie which was very good but rich.  We returned later and it was difficult what to choose for breakfast.  We went with fresh fruit and pancakes and bacon.  All of it was very tasty but I really liked the bacon and the fruit the best.  You order at the window and then they bring your meal to you.  The service was friendly and fast and the restaurant is clean and bright with nice art on the walls.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "RKHualapai, RK Founder at Rachel&#39;s Kitchen, responded to this review", "text": "Hi Jean, \r\n  Thank you for your review and letting others know about your experience Happy to hear you enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere.
