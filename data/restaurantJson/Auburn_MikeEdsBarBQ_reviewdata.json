I stopped for lunch and even though there was a line out the door it moved very quick. I enjoyed the Wed special which was 6oz of tender juicy pork and 2 sides with drink for 8 bucks. What a deal. The pork was wonderful and the BBQ slaw is delicious! Great food and fun atmosphere. The ribs looked really good and I overheard the person at the next table raving about how tender the ribs were. I will def go back again on my way back home.
