Ordered 2 buffet lunches and 2 sodas. Surprised that it cost a little more than  $25. Pizzas had good flavor but all were luke warm at best. Not very many folks there and during the 50 minutes or so we were there no other pizzas were brought out with the exception of one dessert pizza. I had high hopes but to no avail. Will drive further to Old World Pizza in Inver Grove if we decide on pizza buffet again as in my opinion price and quality are better there.

We ordered two pizzas.  One had a lot of sauce, the other very little.  And, the dough on one of the pizzas was severely under cooked.
