We had a simple order, two veggie burgers with garlic fries and one hamburger with a side salad.  We waited 30 minutes for our food to be served and then my friend who requested \"no grilled onions on my burger\" was served her burger with grilled onions!  My veggie burger was supposed to have grilled onions but they were still crunchy, not truly grilled. The food was just ok, definately not up to par for a $10 veggie burger!  I won't go back at lunch time because I was late getting back to work due to the snail-slow service. Now I understand why this restaurant is never busy during lunch hour, way too slow!  I do want to say that our waiter was very attentive and we were happy with the service he provided.  I think the problem is in the kitchen!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-11T14:30:17-0400", "location_id": "8311120", "id": "279601850", "user": {"username": "soulsisters", "user_location": {"name": "Modesto, California", "id": "32724"}}}]}
