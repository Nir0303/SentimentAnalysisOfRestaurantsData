Also ordered the cheesie bread breadsticks which only had cheese and no flavor and overall the food was warm not hot, I am 3 miles from this location therefore it shouldn't have gotten warm in less than a 15 minute drive from store to hotel.

Yes, it was delivered fast, but ordering on the phone was a nightmare!  The young woman either did not listen, was too busy or who knows but my sister had to repeat at least 10 times simple information.  Later we talked about how it took longer to order than it did to have the food delivered!  Two pizzas that were wrong & dry because we had asked for extra sauce & it was not on them.  Also the types we ordered we not right, we had asked for one meat lovers, but never got it.  We also ordered bread sticks that we never opened, but seemed basic & o.k.  There was a $2.99 Delivery Charge because I guess some folks don't have brains enough to tip, we did anyway on top of this because I am not certain if the delivery driver actually gets it???  I called the manager who apparently was the same person who took the order according to the slip & she did offer to get us out another order, but we declined & she did say she would apply a credit to my sister's account.  We'll see.  Obviously a busy location with confusion of orders, so be careful.

There was nothing premium about the premium pizza we ordered, and the website was down, so couldn't get the deal (which frustrated my wife) and the manager wouldn't give it to her by phone.  Finally, and this probably applies to just about all pizza delivery, not just Pizza Hut, in a world of Uber, Lyft, and GPS on smartphone, I am baffled that the drivers are given no tools to practice their trade.  We often don't order from Pizza Hut because getting the pizza to us is so difficult!!!
