Buildings look somewhat dated and not so inviting.  I was with my spouse and we went through the drive in and instead of ordering the traditional roast beef sandwich we both ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality and amount of chicken, ham and cheese on this sandwich.  We also ordered the waffle fries and these were also much better than the traditional seasoned fries that they carry.  Overall this was a great experience and we both said that we would certainly be ordering this again.  Well as an update, I stopped there this week and ordered the sandwich and the fries and to my surprise I was told that they were no longer selling the waffle fries.  This was a real downer.  Their waffle fries were great.\nTypically I would not do a review on a fast food restaurant but this was worth taking the time to tell readers about a great sandwich and fries.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-28T11:35:03-0400", "location_id": "10439212", "id": "411949503", "user": {"username": "Thomas P", "user_location": {"name": "Edmond", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Waited for 20 minutes, no help", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51327-d10439212-r383254445-m11068-Arby_s-Edmond_Oklahoma.html#review383254445", "text": "We got here around 11:30am which was just before a lunch rush.  No other customer was in the store and no one in the drive thru. With it so empty we figured that it would be an easy pop in and pop out right before the lunch rush.  We stood around waiting at the counter, but no one came to wait on us or see if we had been helped. There did not appear to be any workers in the store either. Finally waiting for about 20 minutes we gave up, went outside and got in our car. Starting the car we noticed two employees who had been \"Hiding\" at the front of the store in the seating area.
