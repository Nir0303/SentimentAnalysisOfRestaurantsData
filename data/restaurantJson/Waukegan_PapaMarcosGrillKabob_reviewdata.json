When we heard about Papa Marcos in Waukegan, we went there not knowing what to expect.\nHere's what we found: The restaurant is like the old-fashioned diners of olden times: small, clean and simple.  It is run by a young couple, Marina and Michael.  Marina attended to our orders with a big smile and a cheerful  spirit. Two of us ordered lamb shawarma and one ordered chicken shawerma.  Big plates with  the grills came on top of a bed of saffron rice, and three bottles of condiments yogurt, tahini and gyro sauce.  I put tahini on one side of my plate and yogurt on the other. The result was very satisfactory.  We enjoyed a brief conversation with Marina and we we were rewarded with her intelligence and a small plate of baklava (on the house). Then Michael left his post in the kitchen and came over for a short visit.  We found him knowledgeable and charming.\nAnyone who wants a low-cost, high quality lunch is encouraged to check our Papa Marcos.  The only thing I wanted but couldn't have was a beer, but the place is not licensed for alcoholic beverages.\nThe value for price index is very favorable for Papa Marcos.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-14T14:21:16-0500", "location_id": "3372829", "id": "437228461", "user": {"username": "Nathir S", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "A real local treasure", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36854-d3372829-r436648740-m11068-Papa_Marco_s_Grill_Kabob-Waukegan_Lake_County_Illinois.html#review436648740", "text": "What a gem this is!

There are often little extras provided free of charge - a sample of grape leaves or a plate of baklava.\n\nOwner: Love Michel.  He served in the US military for many years and is now doing this.  Quite successfully.  From Lebanon he fought in the Christian militia in the seventies.  He is fluent in French and Arabic and work as a translator for the US.  Those are the same two languages that our daughter is fluent in so we were happy to introduce her to Michel recently.\n\nPrices: You can't beat the value here.  Big plates of hummus and baba ghanoush.  Love the plates of Shawarma (you can get a combo of meat) served over rice.  I can never get enough of the tahini sauce and hot sauce.
