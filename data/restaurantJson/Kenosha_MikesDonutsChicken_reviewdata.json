I read about Second Saturday's and wanted to visit Mike's. I was starved having no breakfast. The pub was packed with people only the high tables with high spinner stools were available. It took awhile before a server came to our table. We ordered water which took awhile and then placed an order. The daily soup and biscuits will take  20......minutes...wow I am hungry now......  The ''special'' was suppose to be ''Chicken Pot Pie Soup'' upon visiting the pub the soup was on the regular menu. The SHOCK set in when I read on the menu that the soup was $6.95 a bowl (topped with a in-house made biscuit). Ala crate the biscuits are  two for $2.50 with what tasted like maple butter. The soup of the day ($4.95 a bowl about 2 cup measure I would say) was a squash, bacon and corn chowder. No cracker, no croutons just a soup spoon. The biscuit tasted a lot like Hardee's but smaller and without the crisp delicious buttery bottoms. I would take Hardee's over these but I do like Mike's maple whipped butter. The soup was good but took long 20 minutes to get and I feel is overpriced. The place is loud and sports on the TV'S. The table are very close to each other. The bathroom is your typical ber/pub bathroom with lots of large black and white pictures of actors some even somewhat unclothed. Doughnuts are over priced. Our waiter was excellent ''Brandon''.

For me it was Mike's Donuts & Chicken. This place is truly unique! Our family ended up here when another restaurant had too long of a wait, recommended by my college \u2013 aged son. Mike's was buzzing! There was a plethora of TVs throughout. Private parties available upstairs. Sports-book in the back. They had a wall of Jameson bottles that apparently you could buy and store there, a la Japanese restaurants and sake. The Chicken sandwiches are very good. You can get them any way you want. I had mine with dark meat on biscuits. And I recommend fried versus grilled. Coleslaw came on the sandwich, which I loved. I will definitely try this place again. The reasons I gave it a three: They were out of donuts, out of the first two draft beers I chose, and our table could've been cleaner. Also, the service was slow on this night, but that was understandable, given the situation.

The last few times I've gone they've been out of stuff.  I get that they were out of the Philly Cheesesteak since they specialize in chicken and I found something to replace it.  The last straw was when I was there on a Monday night to have the special 1/2 price bucket.  We arrived about 6:15 and were told that they were out of chicken breasts to put in the bucket but someone was out buying more.  No problem - we thought - we told the server that we weren't in hurry and we would order one of the $5.00 appetizers (also on special).  Our server was great and kept us posted about the arrival of the chicken.  Finally after 45 minutes or so she asked if we just wanted dark meat.  We agreed to do 4 wings and 4 thigh and legs.  She went to put in order and came back and said they wouldn't do that because they didn't want to compromised the rest of the buckets.  Okay - I even understood that but about 10 minutes later she came back and said they couldn't get any chicken breasts so they were going to do our bucket with dark meat and wings.  Perfect - we finally got out bucket - it was delicious - but really?!? You know it's half price bucket night, you serve chicken breast sandwiches and you don't have chicken?  Can't really understand it. Is there any thought to what you serve or is all your time spent coming up with new doughnut flavors?  Last night we stopped in a for a drink (we ate dinner elsewhere) and they were out of at least 2 of their Octoberfest beers.  Good to Donuts and Chicken - the food when you can get it - is good.
