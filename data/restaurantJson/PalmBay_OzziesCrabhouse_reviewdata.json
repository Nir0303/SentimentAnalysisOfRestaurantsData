So when we came up from South Florida  and found out that there was a new Ozzie's we were excited. Reading all the mediocre reviews here on TA, I thought to myself \"C'mon, how bad can it be? They can't mess up the crabs? Can they?\"\n\nYes, they can and they did! We got there on a rather quiet Sunday evening and were promptly seated and waited on by Alec, who was very good. They had a special of $ 10.00 off their Dozen of Jimmy's and I ordered them half Maryland style, half Garlic. My BF ordered a rare Prime Rib. The Prime Rib came with a deep brown sauce on top of it which actually made it look overcooked. But under that sauce was a totally raw piece of meat with giant hunks of fat on it. The taste didn't resemble Prime Rib at all, rather than a raw piece of rib eye, only about half was somewhat edible. \n\nNow to the crabs. I started with the garlic ones. They were brownish and shriveled up. The first one tasted overcooked. The second one had a distinct taste of ammonia, so it was going bad. There was also barely any taste of garlic, no chunks, I guess they use Garlic Powder? I stopped eating them and started on the Maryland ones, those were ok.\n\nWhen the server came to clear the plates I mentioned the horrible garlic crabs to him and he said he would tell the manager. He came back and said the manager was not willing to do anything about it.  He went to another manager and said that this manager would go back to the original manager to see if something could be done. but no go. The server also admitted that the Garlic Crabs are prepared in advance while the Maryland style Crabs were fresh.\n\nWhat a shame....", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-05T07:00:07-0400", "location_id": "2519564", "id": "414959601", "user": {"username": "exsea", "user_location": {"name": "Miami, Florida", "id": "34438"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Awesome Maryland Crabs", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34528-d2519564-r414165414-m11068-Ozzie_s_Crabhouse-Palm_Bay_Brevard_County_Florida.html#review414165414", "text": "First time eating here.

I awarded five stars because of the food, atmosphere and phenomenal service. This would be an excellent feature for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. It is just a local, hole-in-the wall that serves delicious seafood.\n\nMy wife and I dropped in on a Sunday afternoon exploring drive over to the coast.\n\nMy wife had the blackened mahi and said it was a little overdone. She used a table sauce to add a little moisture and said that it was great. I had the fries seafood platter. My fish was perfect and the shrimp was incredible. When we come back I will go straight for the shrimp platter. I also had an order of hush puppies and they were very good. I always add a smear of butter and a dollop of honey to my hush-puppies to enhance the flavor. Do not miss the cole-slaw; it has a slight vinegar flavor that is very light and refreshing.\n\nWe ate out on the upstairs porch and could hear the slight strains of the live jazz music inside. It was a great setting and all the servers were friendly and helpful. They were very busy so service was delayed; for my wife and I this just added to the charm of a relaxing and enjoyable casual dining experience. Don iscome here in a rush; come to chillax and have fun.\n\nI cannot forget to mention our server, Angela. Although she was a rookie here at three weeks she was exceptionally, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nLike Arnold said, \"We'll be back!\"", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-07T06:26:06-0400", "location_id": "2519564", "id": "370904684", "user": {"username": "rickshawrocket", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, Florida", "id": "34515"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Seafood restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34528-d2519564-r368481272-m11068-Ozzie_s_Crabhouse-Palm_Bay_Brevard_County_Florida.html#review368481272", "text": "Our son and girlfriend were visiting from Mass. and wanted seafood.
