I figure Starbucks gets enough business, so I wanted to support another local small business. Good call!!! Fresh made muffins, pastries, wraps, etc. They also have homemade ice cream. Coffee is Kahwa; roasted locally in Tampa Bay, and it's not watered down.\n\nI had a spinach and feta croissant that was very good. Mom had a nice fluffy croissant,  and dad had a fresh baked blueberry muffin. We all had the awesome coffee.\n\nThey have unique decor and seating for about 20. They have outlets by most seating to plug your devices in. Friendly staff and clean place.\n\nWraps and paninis sound good; I want to come back for lunch.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-07T07:23:00-0400", "location_id": "10694672", "id": "425860848", "user": {"username": "Marilyn M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Very nice coffee house for breakfast or lunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34141-d10694672-r419574225-m11068-The_Grindhouse-Clearwater_Florida.html#review419574225", "text": "We stopped for a light lunch and really liked Grindhouse.

The original artwork / sculptures on the walls is gorgeous.  And, the prices are quite reasonable.  We'll definitely be back to try their many breakfast and lunch offerings, as well as the tempting-looking pastries.
