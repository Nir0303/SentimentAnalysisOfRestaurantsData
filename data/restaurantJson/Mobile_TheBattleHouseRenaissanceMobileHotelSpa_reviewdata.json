Free wifi but I didn't use it so I can't attest to the speed. They have a fitness center and spa but we didn't use those either. The have a restaurant so no free breakfast but there is somewhere to purchase breakfast. Lemon Lime water in the lobby.

This is probably the nicest chain hotel in the city, and of course it is right in the heart of downtown so food and drink is all around you.\nPROS:  Elegant architecture, very comfortable rooms, soft beds, excellent views.  My in-laws had a corner room which was slightly larger, and we had a \"normal\" room facing the river.  The hotel has its own restaurant as well as a separate bar, so all basic needs are met.  We gave away our luggage at the curb and had it in our room within 15 minutes - pretty good considering how big the place is. \nCONS:  No self-parking, but the valet does a good job.  Obviously it is on the higher end of cost for the area as well.  My in-laws had an issue where a tub two floors up overflowed into their room, and they weren't able to be moved elsewhere.  The hotel did its best to clean up the mess though.  Also, one evening the restaurant was closed for a private event - which was unexpected.  However the hostess was great about giving us some recommendations which worked out perfectly.\nI should note I also came here for a meeting a few weeks prior - the food is excellent.  \nOverall this is a beautiful place to stay right in the middle of Mobile.
