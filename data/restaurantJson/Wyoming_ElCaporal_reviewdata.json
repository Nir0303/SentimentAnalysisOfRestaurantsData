Place is always hopping. Make everything from scratch to order. Highly recommend the Alhambre? I know when I see it on the menu!  Plate consists of rice, guac, refried beans, lettuce, tomato, \nchicken, beef or shrimp (we usually get the deluxe plate, which comes with all 3) and a foil wrapped pouch of freshly made, soft, warm corn tortillas. Usually 5, but just ask for extras when you order and they'll throw them in no charge. My wife and I usually split an order, there's that much. OH! And make sure you ask for the grilled veggies (also no charge) Grilled green onions, radish slices and jalapenos. Also, try their Horchada. Sweetened rice milk, VERY delicious. We get cravings for this place, it's THAT good! We had never tried beef tongue before, and she brought us a very generous portion to try - No charge.
