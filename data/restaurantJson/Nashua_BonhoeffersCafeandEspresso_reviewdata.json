Great to lounge, work or visit in. Food was excellent, and surprisingly affordable. Coffee made to perfection, and even non-coffee drinks. Owner/manager was attentive and engaging in that \"just right\" way you might see in a film about a cafe.

I ordered a pecan roll, noticed there were three on one plate and a single on another plate and wondered if the single was left over.  That's the one I was given, and when I picked it up it was quite hard.  I took it back to the counter and asked when it was made, and was told two days before!  Even the other three had been made the previous day.  Many places sell day-old pastries at a reduced price; attempting to foist off less than fresh pastry at full price seems like shaky practice to me. I was grudgingly allowed to exchange the roll for a scone, and it was satisfactory.  While we ate a bakery delivery truck arrived, so I expect that for the first couple of hours each morning customers are getting the previous day's baked goods.  If I were to go back, which I probably won't (I don't live in the area anyway) I would definitely ask when items were made prior to ordering.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-10T09:12:11-0400", "location_id": "1050854", "id": "220890044", "user": {"username": "jandm54", "user_location": {"name": "Westbrook, Maine", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-07", "title": "best coffee in NH!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46172-d1050854-r212861876-m11068-Bonhoeffer_s_Cafe_and_Espresso-Nashua_New_Hampshire.html#review212861876", "text": "This is the best coffee and breakfast pastries that you will find tucked away in a hidden part of downtown Nashua.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-06-30T11:33:15-0400", "location_id": "1050854", "id": "212861876", "user": {"username": "Mary-Ellen M", "user_location": {"name": "Nashua, New Hampshire, United States", "id": null}}}]}
