Several people had recommended Biagio's and I finally was able to have lunch there today. Their menu is really much more extensive than what you would think based on the name - plenty to choose from, not just coffee. Everything on the menu sounded delicious, but I settled on the caprese burger with \"caulicakes.\" (Think of the consistency of a crab cake, but made with ground cauliflower and Italian seasonings.) Burger was served medium, topped with pesto, arugula, and heirloom tomatoes. So delicious! \n \nCan't wait to go back!
