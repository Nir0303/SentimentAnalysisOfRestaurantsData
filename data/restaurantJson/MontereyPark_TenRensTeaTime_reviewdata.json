I think this might be my \"go to\" place for tea. This place is a little pricier than other places, but you're actually getting tea in your drinks instead of sugar and milk. For both visits, we ordered the Oolong Milk Tea and the Fresh Taro Green Milk Tea. The oolong milk tea had a strong oolong taste and wasn't too sugary. The taro milk tea actually had pieces of taro inside instead of just using taro powder like at other tea places. They have a Top 5 drinks list posted on the board an from listening, it seemed pretty accurate. Lets talk service. Service is surprisingly quick. The first time we were there, it was 4 pm and no one was there. They had a 913 milk tea sample but the tea was out. We asked if we could try and they quickly made a fresh pot just for us. They even refilled our sample cups without us asking. Today was busy. We arrived around 12:30 and was packed. Even with 2 people making drinks/ordering, everyone got their drinks within 5 min. They even had time to  refill their sample drink: Love Potion #9. If you're not looking for milk tea, love potion #9 is a green apple flavored tea mixed with peach flavored tea. Looks like the place has free wifi, but a quick scan wasn't able to locate any outlets. If this place is packed, it can get noisy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-24T17:00:09-0400", "location_id": "4729710", "id": "367017512", "user": {"username": "leep116", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Good Iced Tea and Food Entrees.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32738-d4729710-r307330461-m11068-Ten_Ren_s_Tea_Time-Monterey_Park_California.html#review307330461", "text": "Ten Ren's is known for serving Taiwanese Tea.
