On that wall was the TV, so you had to be careful not to hit it.   \n\nWhen I was looking over the room there was no hair conditioner in the bathroom, just 2 shampoo and 1 bar of soap...ALL on the floor of the bathroom.  The sink had no ledge that you could set anything on, and the shower soap holder was not constructed correctly, it tipped down, everything just rolled off of it.  I called the front desk, asking for a conditioner, knowing I would need some for my shower in the AM.  The front desk lady said there was none, the shampoo was both, I said it just says Shampoo on it not 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.   I asked again for some conditioner, I need it.  She said they don't have any.  I've NEVER checked into a hotel with out conditioner.

The clerk (Sonia), didn't acknowledge anything and proceeded to charge my credit card for the full night.  I told her that I believe it is already pre-paid through Priceline.  She said \"no\".  As I didn't have my full receipt with me, it was late and we were tired, I allowed her to charge my credit card.  The room was horrible - smelled like mold, torn carpet, moldy bathroom, overnight guest fight etc.  The next morning, I was able to confirm that Priceline had also charged me for the reservation.  Turns out we inadvertently checked-in to the wrong Rodeway Inn (the other one is just 1 mile away on the same street on Route 66).  The clerk (Sonia) knowingly charged us even though the reservation wasn't at her location.  She led me to believe that I was checking in to the correct hotel.

I had reservations based on other reviews but took the chance because it was a good location within easy walking distance to downtown. You definitely get what you pay for, and when the rate is half as much as other nearby hotels, there is certainly a reason. I couldn't sleep first night because the train came by every 30 minutes. I'm not a light sleeper but the train is a stone's throw away and incredibly loud. Also woke up every time the heater came on- almost as loud as the train was.\n\nWe went skiing on New Year's Eve and made the mistake of leaving our purses in the room. When we came back in the afternoon, we saw that housekeeping had come through and realized our purses had been left in plain sight. My sister was almost certain $10 cash was missing from her wallet, but didn't have proof and nothing else appeared to be missing so we let it go. Two weeks later I saw that my registered Starbucks gift card had been used in Flagstaff while I was back home in Phoenix. I checked my wallet and sure enough my gift card was missing. Called my sister and she had also realized her Bed Bath and Beyond gift card had gone missing from her wallet (a gift from her recent wedding). \n\nCalled Choice Hotels to report the missing items and request a credit for the amount taken. Was told that all their properties are franchised and that due to the nature of my claim it would need to be resolved by the property owner. The customer service agent took my information, submitted my complaint to the owner and told me they are obligated to reply within 72 hours. That time came and went with no response so I called Choice Hotels to follow up and was told again that their properties are franchised and the issue would need to be resolved by the property owner. No response received from the property owner, and no help in resolving the issue from Choice customer service. \n\nTrust the reviews, it is not worth the small amount that you save to stay here.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Dipesh P, Guest Relations Manager at Rodeway Inn Downtown, responded to this review", "text": "I am very sorry to hear that you experienced such unusual circumstances and inconveniences during your visit with us, especially that we were not able to address the issues and misunderstandings right away.
