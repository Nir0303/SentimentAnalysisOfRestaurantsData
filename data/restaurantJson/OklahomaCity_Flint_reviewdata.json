The server was well-intentioned and polite but not very knowledgable.  My Caesar salad was very small and tasted nothing like a Caesar; no garlic, tiny bits of iceberg lettuce; and missing the Parmesan crisp and the crostini that were listed on the menu.  And this was a consistent problem: the menu described specific ingredients but they were missing from the dishes as served.  I ordered the lamb chops, which were delicious, but the menu described the dish this way: \"Brown Sugar-Seared Colorado Lamb Chop, Grand Marnier, Israeli Couscous, Shaved Brussels Sprouts, Broccolini, Sun-Dried Tomatoes\" but there were no Brussel sprouts at all and only tiny bits of broccoli and tomatoes mixed in with a huge quantity of couscous.  I objected and they brought a side of Brussel sprouts, but they were swimming in butter.  My husband's hanger steak was good but very rare, as were my lamb chops, even though we ordered them medium rare and medium, respectively.  The wine list is nice but it seems to take a long time to get the wine, well into our salads before it arrived.  The bread was ok but tasted of reheating.  As others have mentioned, the restaurant is often mostly empty, but we were there on a Saturday night when every room in and around the city was booked,and yet there were only a few tables with guests at 8:00.  Given the prices and the very mixed food and service, I can see why.

Our visit was during a significant construction upgrade, so the ambience was lacking. However, the ambient music played was mostly mid to late 1990s hits, can\u2019t say much wrong anyplace that plays Dave Matthews Band! Anyway, the menu choices are excellent; the lamb chops (3) were cooked perfectly, and the Israeli couscous was a nice addition, not dry but fresh and slightly earthy. The bison pot roast with root vegetables was perhaps a bit too hearty for early September and 90 degrees outside, but the slight gaminess of the bison translated well and enhanced the veggies. Portion size was very good, maybe too much couscous.
