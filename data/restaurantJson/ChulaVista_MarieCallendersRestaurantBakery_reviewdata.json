I have been there many times before & mostly enjoyed it. Not this time. \n\nI have an extreme allergy to cheese, get extremely nauseous. I have always enjoyed their chili & cornbread. After all these years I am always very adamant that the cheese be left off.\n\nWhen the chili arrived, I didn't see any cheese. I always stir the crisp toppings & onions into the chili before digging in. When I took the spoon out, there were strings of cheese clinging to the spoon! Thank God, I had not yet taken a bite.  We couldn't find the waitress anywhere. Finally, after over 15 minutes I had to go to the counter to get help.  25 minutes later the waitress appeared. She insisted that there was no cheese so I had to prove it to her by showing her.  She apologized & took it away. Obviously, the cook had put cheese on top out of habit & then realizing what he had done, had tried to scoop it out. But you simply can't scoop out melted cheese. This was a very careless thing to do. He should have made a new bowl. By the time I got my bowl of \"cheeseless\" chili, everyone else had almost finished eating.\n\nThe menu states that the chili comes with cornbread. Also cornbread is brought to the table for everyone. When I got my chili, there was one square of cornbread left in the bread basket, which was cold. I asked the waitress if I could please have the cornbread (hot) that was included in the price of my meal. She told me that she would get in trouble... that she had been told they couldn't bring any more cornbread until it was all gone! I was tempted to throw it on the floor, but my son took it on his plate so the waitress would bring the bread. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the new bowl of chili was only lukewarm. But everyone was finished & just waiting on me so I downed about half of it, wrapped the piece of cornbread that finally arrived in a napkin & took it home.\n\nWas this fiasco the waitress? Or the cook? Or is something else going on with the management? (Or all the above).  We also noticed that the restaurant has been stripped of most of it's decorations... bare walls, etc..  And the salad bar is a joke, no more hot bacon dressing & very few condiments.\n\nOn a brighter note, there was a sale on their pies, so I bought a custard pie to take home.  This was one of the tastiest, freshest custard pies I've had in years!
