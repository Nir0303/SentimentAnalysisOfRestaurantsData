The waitress brought us tortilla chips, salsa, sour cream and guacamole.. The salsa was good but in my opinion could use some heat but my wife said it was great. The guac was fresh and yummy. My wife ordered a bowl of Tortilla soup. She did not like it she said it was too salty. I tried it and I  liked it. My wife ordered a chicken buritto with black beans. It came with Spanish rice and the side. I order a special, it was a shirt steak with a great sauce on top of it. I cant remember what kind of sauce it was.  It came with yucca fries on the side. I ordered a side of Spanish rice too. Our entrees were great, I did not care for the yucca fries but everything else was great. The Spanish rice was very good. The steak was very flavorful and tender. I tried my wife's buritto that she couldn't finish and it was very very good. For dessert we tried the banana bread pudding. It had real good flavor but we did not care for the texture. I guess we are not bread pudding lovers. The waitress was great she was knowledgeable, attentive and had a great personality. You could tell she liked her job. When we ordered dessert we were not sure if we wanted to try the banana bread pudding or the lime pie. The waitress could tell we were not crazy about the bread pudding so she gave us a piece of lime pie. She just went and got it she didn't ask us she just did it. Waitresses, if you want a huge tip try this! One reason we don't go downtown a lot is because of the parking. We had no problem parking there.

Effect was an almost-French sensibility of plate composition - thoughtfully considering tastes, textures, smells, appearance - using Mexican/Spanish flavored. It worked!\nThe Mexican coffee and flan special (Mexican chocolate) made a great finish.\nDining room is airy and cleverly decorated, making good use of the former church building.\nService was very friendly and gently attentive - as I like - and gave helpful advice.

The menu obviously includes some of the more expected fare, but also some unexpected Mexican dishes that you won't normally find north of the border.  For example, I had a rice dish that also featured huitlacoche, which is a corn fungus that is often considered a delicacy in Mexico.  It has a wonderful garlic taste!  And although I've looked for it often, this is the first time that I've encountered it in a Mexican restaurant.  Another great dish is the Alb\u00f3ndigas, a Mexican meatball dish that is served as a starter, but could easily be an entree.  The seasoning and texture were absolutely wonderful!  The white sangria was also very, very good.\n\nThe Mission features a menu that changes seasonally, so you may find new delicacies at any time.\n\nService was fantastic.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable regarding ingredients and preparation, as well as being in the know on the history of the building, which according to our server (and the restaurant's web site) was \"built in the 1840\u2019s and formerly the Syracuse Wesleyan Methodist Church, was also an important 19th century way station on the Underground Railroad.\"\n\nHighly recommended, and we will be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-08T12:06:27-0500", "location_id": "458518", "id": "345929934", "user": {"username": "Brad R", "user_location": {"name": "Syracuse, New York", "id": "48713"}}}]}
