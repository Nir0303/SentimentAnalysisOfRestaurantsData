We discovered this place very near our house back in July, 2016.  The first time we went we ordered pizza, garlic rolls, and ziti. What were we thinking!  That was a huge amount of food for two people, so we had a ton of leftovers.  Let me start with the pizza and qualify this by noting that pizza preferences are very subjective.  My brother and I both thought it was OK, but my brother thought the crust was too thin and tough and I thought the pie was too greasy. However, I can also see how someone else would just love that pizza, including a bunch of our friends.  And I have to qualify my statement further by saying that we ate every bite of it over the next day or so.  The ziti, however, was another story.  Oh.my.goodness!  It was SOOOOO good.  Truly the best ziti ever.  It's a huge plateful, with lots of cheese and wonderful sauce.  It's a winner for sure.  We'll be back for more of that.  Absolutely.  The next visit, I tried a Steak Philly, and that was also quite yummy.  And let me just pause here to say the staff are really nice people.  We really have enjoyed our brief conversations with them and feel welcome there.  Our next visits involved ziti again.  How could they not?  The staff rave about the fried cannolis, but we've always been too full to try them.
