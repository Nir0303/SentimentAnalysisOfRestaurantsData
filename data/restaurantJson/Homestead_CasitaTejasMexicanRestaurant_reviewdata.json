Just moved to Homestead so I have been trying many different places, but not many have the friendly service, great food, and good price all in one place!  We did not have any alcohol this time so not sure how the price is on that, but they did offer beer, wine, and margaritas!!  Thanks for the great service that seems hard to find down here!!  Can't wait to go back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-26T17:14:00-0400", "location_id": "794571", "id": "386255603", "user": {"username": "Jen S", "user_location": {"name": "Homestead, Florida", "id": "60739"}}}]}
