They have a staff there to press the button for you to get a ticket.  Yes they just stand there and press the button.  Once you park you have to pay before you leave at a pay station.  There is only ONE pay station for the whole 4 floors of parking and it is on the first floor in the vestibule.  LINES OUT THE DOOR and wait for at least 30 minutes plus to pay.  Then once you do pay it is at least 30 minutes or more to get out because those same employees pressing the button for you to get your ticket are there at the bottom to put your paid ticket in the machine!  SERIOUSLY!?  Just take my money and it would go a lot faster.  Terrible!  The only reason we went into the parking garage is because there is no parking anywhere around the venue unless you have a VIP pass.  Plus all the roads are one way so if you miss something you have to go around.  Then there are no police to direct traffic so you have long lines.  Just terrible.  Then once you finally do park, it is off to the venue only to wait in the long lines there.  Be warned, you get frisked as you walk into the venue and they do not allow ANYTHING.  So you have to go back into your car to put whatever away.  I was waiting for my husband along with at least half a dozen other people.  The actual arena is great to watch a game.  All seats are great.  Lines for concessions are crazy but they go kind of fast, they do not have any vendors walking up and down the aisle for safety reasons (I totally get that).
