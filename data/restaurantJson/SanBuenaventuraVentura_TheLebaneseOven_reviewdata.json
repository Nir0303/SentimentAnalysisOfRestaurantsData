After that we order the chicken shoarma with different sides.\n\nIt took a while for the shoarma to come and the owner apologised various times for that. We were not in a hurry and enjoyed the evening so all was well. Also we were given free salad and pita, to eat with the humus, as we waited.\n\nIt was worth the waiting. The shoarma was delicious. Good serving; chicken was succulent and very tasty. You can see the traditional hand in this meal. The lebanese salad was also very fresh and tasty.\n\nAs dessert we had baklava which was also very good!\n\nThis is a really good place and recommend people to come over for a nice dinner!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-22T19:55:34-0400", "location_id": "10151926", "id": "430748933", "user": {"username": "AvdV80", "user_location": {"name": "Fortaleza, CE", "id": "303293"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Not as good as I expected", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60769-d10151926-r402465210-m11068-The_Lebanese_Oven-Ventura_California.html#review402465210", "text": "After reading reviews I expected really good Middle Eastern food.
