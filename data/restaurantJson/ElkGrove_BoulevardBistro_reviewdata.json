The friends that I visit there always have said great things about BB. I finally made a reservation to go there with them. What a disappointment. For starters, we ordered two plates to share, bone marrow and goat cheese. The bone marrow yielded about a tablespoon each and the goat cheese a tablespoon-sized bite for each of us. We all got the wedge lettuce salad, which was bland and nothing special, but expensive at ten dollars. I ordered the scallops with creamed corn. I should say scallop because what I literally got was one scallop and a piece of a scallop that was about one-fourth of a scallop. I cut the scallop into four pieces in order to have a five bite main course. The scallop was served on a bed of creamed corn, which was overly peppered and,again, the portion was remarkably small; the creamed corn serving could not have been more than a half of a cup, meaning another few bites. At twenty six dollars, the few bites of scallop and corn were quite expensive, to say the least. My companions ordered the rack of lamb, the seared salmon, and the pork loin. The rack of lamb consisted of three small ribs piled crisscross on the plate, which yielded about three small bites from each rib. The seared salmon consisted of about four ounces of overly-cooked and therefore dry salmon, again just a few bites. The only winner was the pork loin, which came with a rich dark brown sauce and looked like enough to feed two people. One of my companions, who has eaten there on occasion before, observed that she was very surprised at how \"skimpy\" the portions were, but for the pork loin. One out of four is not good.

This little gem of a restaurant is exceptional EVERY TIME we dine there. The food is exquisitely flavoured, with the BEST ingredients shining through. The chef is clearly classically trained, and amazingly creative. As a Cordon Bleu trained person myself, I really appreciate a good demi-glace sauce, as well as enjoying the new American twists the chef comes up with. The menu is short, as should be the case when all the food is being made from scratch. \n\nThe chef appears to care deeply about getting the best possible ingredients, picking individual tomatoes and often creating a single perfect off-menu dish from a small number of spectacularly flavored vegetables for my vegetarian husband.\n\nAmazingly, Boulevard Bistro always seems to have a number of absolutely delicious gluten-free desserts too, for the celiacs among us. None of the store-bought boring sorbet or uninteresting fruit plate here! Given that this is a small, family-run restaurant, I suggest, if you have dietary issues, that you let them know when you book, and perhaps choose to dine at a less busy time than the middle of service, but even if you don't do that, I'll bet you have an amazing experience dining here.\n\nThis is a place at which to eat mindfully, savouring every mouthful. If you are looking for mega portions of in-your-face-flavored chain restaurant fare, this is not that. This is high quality, fascinating, beautifully-flavoured and beautifully-presented dishes in portion sizes that aren't so vast you'll be eating the leftovers for weeks. \n\nThe restaurant is small but beautiful in terms of decor. I love the fact that everyone seems to dress beautifully to dine at Boulevard Bistro -- there are so few places in Elk Grove where dressing up doesn't look out of place! Yet despite the fact that this restaurant has such a quietly classy ambiance, there is no trace of snobbery or snootiness here. The waiting staff are utterly charming and quietly friendly and attentive -- not over-friendly or getting in the way -- just perfect. Really first rate staff.\n\nPerfect restaurant for an anniversary dinner -- or any excuse! The chef is a genius. An absolute genius.

The crab cake was an outstanding appetizer.  The poached egg on top was an unusual but delicious addition.  Our daughter enjoyed the pork cheeks.  I couldn't keep my fork out of it.  My rack of lamb beautifully prepared and plated.  Husband's filet A++.  Service never fails to be impeccable.  So many restaurants in our area loose their edge after a time.
