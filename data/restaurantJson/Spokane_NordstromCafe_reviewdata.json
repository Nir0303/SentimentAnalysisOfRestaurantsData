The atmosphere is casually elegant, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are comparable to similar mid-priced establishments.  I ordered the salmon and asparagus pasta dish and my husband had a lamb sandwich.  Both were very good, although for the price of my meal ($14), it didn't come with a salad or any other side dishes.  Same for the lamb sandwich.  Each of us ordered a glass of wine ($9 - $10 a glass).  Our server did try and upsell us on the wine and suggested that we could buy the bottle if we really liked our glasses of wine.     \nWe also ordered a chocolate and coconut bar for dessert.  Really good and the other dessert options looked appealing as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for something away from the crowds and still want to be in the downtown mall area, this is a nice option.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-13T18:32:17-0500", "location_id": "8668944", "id": "332566503", "user": {"username": "Alverda3", "user_location": {"name": "Spokane, Washington", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Great lunch spot ....", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58759-d8668944-r326936935-m11068-Nordstrom_Cafe-Spokane_Washington.html#review326936935", "text": "I love to have lunch at the Nordstrom Caf\u00e9 in downtown Spokane.

The tomato basil soup is really good, the salad greens are always very fresh, and the cookies are so good.

This little cafe is worth a stop for lunch or dinner on any day!\n\nTucked away on the third floor of Spokane's downtown Nordstrom, this sweet little eatery offers delicious soups, salads and a variety of sandwiches along with some mighty tempting desserts.\n\nI settled on the grilled shrimp and arugula salad.   It came with perfectly toasted cubes of polenta, crumbled parmesan crackers, nice big grilled prawns and tons of fresh greens, all tossed with a light creamy garlic vinaigrette.  It was simply delicious!  \n\nMy girlfriend had the cilantro chicken salad and between the two of us making yummy noises while we worked our way through lunch, we still managed to have a fun and intimate conversation, because the place is quiet and features booths as well as tables.\n\nSince we'd been so pious to have salads for lunch, we splurged and split a maple pecan cookie and coffee for dessert.  Again, well worth the calories and plenty big for two people who just want a nibble of something sweet.\n\nThe Nordstrom Cafe is unexpectedly delightful and well worth stopping for a meal again soon!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-29T12:13:07-0400", "location_id": "8668944", "id": "314848612", "user": {"username": "MsJeanna", "user_location": {"name": "Bayview, Idaho", "id": "35387"}}}, {"lang": "it", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Notevole ristorante all'interno di Nordstrom", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58759-d8668944-r412978705-m11068-Nordstrom_Cafe-Spokane_Washington.html#review412978705", "text": "Inserito all'ultimo piano dei grandi magazzini Nordstrom  il Caf\u00e8 \u00e8 una piacevole sorpresa per la qualit\u00e0 e variet\u00e0 dei piatti e per la gentilezza e premurosit\u00e0 del personale, da non mancare un assaggio della tomato soup, veramente gustosa.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-30T22:52:52-0400", "location_id": "8668944", "id": "412978705", "user": {"username": "Antonio F", "user_location": {"name": "Olbia, Italy", "id": "187883"}}}]}
