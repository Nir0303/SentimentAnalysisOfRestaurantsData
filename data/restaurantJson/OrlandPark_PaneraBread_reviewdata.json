The manager on duty has zero regard for how long people wait in line or how long they have to wait for their food. It is not uncommon to wait 20 minutes or more for a simple pastry or bagel. This is not been a terribly high traffic area either. If it wasn't for the fact that my children survive on their muffins on some mornings I would absolutely never return to this location!
