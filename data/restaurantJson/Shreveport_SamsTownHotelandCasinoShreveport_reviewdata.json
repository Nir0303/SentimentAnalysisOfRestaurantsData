Since previous reviews, I have seen some downers but great uppers! The down side of things, the pool is being taken for granted. Unfortunately, people who don't belong there like to take things that don't belong to them at the pool or destroy things. Sadly to say, all the bar stools that the bar had are now gone due to people abusing the seats ie: throwing in pool, jumping off of, etc. they are not replacing, so I have been  told. The grill for cooking hotdogs and so on..destroyed as well! Sam's Town you could replenish just by simply having someone (during peak season) set at the podium upon entry and make sure the people have a room and the required amount per room. Make them show their id's and verify room with a computer installed for the clerk. Have security set in an area outside or even in the air conditioned fitness facility to watch at all times. Where there's a will there's a way! Let us beat those people who take advantage and do something. During peak season, like I have stated before, set a band outside on one end of the pool area. this would draw a crowd back to the pool and the bar service would pick up as well.\nAs for the upper side of things, all I can say is WOW! I love the changes that were made with your tier program. Being a Sapphire member for awhile now, I love the new perks of having a Host. I feel that was the right thing to do. I spend a good amount of money there to obtain this level of recognition and appreciate what is given to me. I utilized the 1 hour slot hold this last visit to cash in a ticket and the staff was very nice and quick to help. My rooms I am receiving are stupendous with one little exception on the last trip, the phone between the bed was missing everything..buttons and information?? The room was clean, accommodative and temperature was excellent. As for the housekeeper on the floor, super work, Needed more ashtrays and was given within 5 minutes. \nLastly, I want to shout out to the BEST HOST I have ever gotten, BERKELIA PLAYER!! This host is one to hold on to and highly recognize.

We ate at the three of the restaurants, the buffet, the deli, and Smokey Joe's - the catfish at the buffet and Smokey Joe's was cooked perfectly, with a light breading, so it wasn't too heavy.  Everything we sampled at the buffet was good.  We visited the buffet around 8pm, excellent considering the time we stopped there for dinner.  Definitely the nicest stay at Sam's Town Shreveport so far!
