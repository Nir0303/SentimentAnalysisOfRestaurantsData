I had a sausage sandwich and my son had a calzone. Both were just OK. We also got an order of bread sticks which ended up just being a pizza crust cut into strips, which was kind of disappointing. I ordered a salad and I got iceberg lettuce instead of mixed greens, which was odd because it was the waiter who actually asked me which I wanted since I didn't initially specify. Also the pizza sauce they gave us to dip the crust slices (bread sticks) into was really cold, like refrigerated cold. I asked the manager to get us some warm sauce, and he did, but he said it's supposed to be cold for health regulations.
