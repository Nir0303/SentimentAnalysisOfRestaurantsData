I had 2 authentic carne asado tacos...which means small round corn tortillas with grilled meat, onion and cilantro.  My extra refritos added to the enjoyment.  Hubby had chile relleno that was HUGE and delicious.  Their hot sauce was a bit hot on first taste, but got milder as the amount in the bowl decreased.  This meal tasted as good as tacos and food we have had in Todos Santos, Baja.  There is also a panederia (bakery) but too stuffed to try one.  Will be back for hubby to get huevos rancheros.  And glad we live near Lubbock so we can come often.
