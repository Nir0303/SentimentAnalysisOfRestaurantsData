But I highly recommend the pecan pie, & I've heard the others are good as well. We've dined at the Lenexa & Shawnee locations & I have to say, Shawnee Pegah's has Lenexa beat for great taste. I thought the prices were a little high, but I'm thankful there's still a place in the suburbs that serves real veggies and a home-cooked taste. Thank you, Pegah's!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-11T10:27:05-0500", "location_id": "842328", "id": "332127587", "user": {"username": "emelle12", "user_location": {"name": "OLATHE", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Good!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g39061-d842328-r328474366-m11068-Pegah_s_Family_Restauant-Shawnee_Kansas.html#review328474366", "text": "Pegah's is a good old fashioned family restaurant.
