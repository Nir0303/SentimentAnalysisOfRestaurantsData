We went on 24th July; a Sunday lunchtime. We didn't have a reservation but were seated in the bar area which was very airy with views to the outside. The waiter was very helpful and friendly. My linguine was delicious but my husband had a chicken dish and had to send it back as the chicken breast was stone cold in the middle. It was as if it had been cooked in advance and reheated.  He then waited a further 20 minutes for a replacement by which time I had finished my meal. Also, he was just given the chicken in sauce and no additional vegetables which he had previously ordered.  I also feel I must mention the staff who were constantly arguing and shouting at each other. These were mainly the bar staff and chefs who were preparing antipasto. This was not conducive to a relaxing Sunday lunch.  Despite this I will return, but will ensure I book into the main restaurant.
