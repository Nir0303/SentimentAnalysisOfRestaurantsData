The Kentucky derby was on -- the restaurant was jam packed.  Fortunately, we were able to get a table quickly.\nThe food is very good. I have never had an issue -- we enjoyed our fried calamari, the avocado salad is terrific, and the fajitas were very tasty.  I am a fan of chile relleno but not at Cacique -- the pepper was severely under cooked.\nService.  What can I say?  If you go, expect to be ignored.  I finished my beer and wanted a second.  It took 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention.  He returned with an empty glass, admitting he forgot what I ordered.  We had to retrieve silverware from other tables.  It took him 30 minutes to take our order.\nI rate this restaurant as average overall.  The service really detracts from the quality of the food.\nGo for the food, not the service.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-05-12T04:40:30-0400", "location_id": "635154", "id": "372322739", "user": {"username": "Vulturecap", "user_location": {"name": "Middletown, md", "id": null}}}]}
