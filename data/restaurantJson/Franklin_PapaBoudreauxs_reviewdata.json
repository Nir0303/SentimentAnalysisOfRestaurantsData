Yum!!!  Great food, nice staff.  Small place, but worth the stop.  The fish was perfectly cooked and delicious.  I 'saved' enough room for the beignets.  I even had lunch the next day from the leftovers.  Definitely worth the stop!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-13T18:23:39-0400", "location_id": "2169781", "id": "364029041", "user": {"username": "PKPollard", "user_location": {"name": "Bartlett, Tennessee", "id": "54885"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Little New Orleans in Franklin, TN", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55055-d2169781-r363394642-m11068-Papa_Boudreaux_s-Franklin_Tennessee.html#review363394642", "text": "A great find in Franklin, TN.
