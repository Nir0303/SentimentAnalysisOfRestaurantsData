My only complaint about this restaurant is that it pretty much ruins you as far as going to any other Thai restaurants -- the food is that special.  Its relatively poorly-marked location is at the corner of Broadway & El Camino in Redwood City.  While the outside appearance of the restaurant looks strip-mall normal, the interior is very nice.  The five Thai sisters that opened the restaurant 17 years ago (and still own it) are all very charming and thoroughly knowledgeable about the menu -- service is a family affair and consistently excellent.  The menu is fairly extensive, and the cook will adjust the spiciness level to your taste.  We have not had a dish there that we did not enjoy.\n\nThe restaurant's wine list is a relatively short and undistinguished one, so we regularly bring our own wine for which there is only a modest corkage ($7).  I would recommend this restaurant without reservation to casual diners and foodies alike.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-13T13:31:30-0400", "location_id": "469073", "id": "205429058", "user": {"username": "ghsfcal", "user_location": {"name": "Redwood City, California", "id": null}}}]}
