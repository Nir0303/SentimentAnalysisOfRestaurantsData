My room was great.  It was nice having (free) breakfast every morning at my leisure.  My room was near the breakfast room so I'd run out and get a quick coffee before my shower, then a full breakfast an hour later. \nFront desk folks were very friendly, always greeted us and even called me the day of my arrival because the room was ready a little early.\nGreat location, easy free parking, fresh fruit in the lobby, a nice ambiance.\nI will return again. \nThe hotel was completely full every day I was there but I didn't have any problems with my room bring cleaned or check in/out.  \n\nIf you are a light sleeper I suggest you don't have a second floor room near the breakfast room. People are loud in the hallway on their way. \n\nI loved the second floor room not only for the nearby food, but the stairs were convenient so one flight up was the ice machine, candy and soda machines- one flight down and I was in the lobby. \n\n", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "TexanAngel, Director of Sales at BEST WESTERN PLUS Avita Suites, responded to this review", "text": "Hello and thank you for your review -\n\nWe are happy you enjoyed your visit with us.
