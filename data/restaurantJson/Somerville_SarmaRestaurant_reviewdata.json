Oleana is a cozy comfortable atmosphere located in a classic Cambridge neighborhood.  Sarma on the other hand has hard wooden chairs for seating (very uncomfortable) and is located in a classic Somerville neighborhood.  Difficult parking.  \nThe service at Parma is more relaxed, but the idea of bringing extra dinner choices on trays, to the table, during supper is a bad idea.  The atmosphere here is already fairly noisy with many wait staff moving throughout.  I am not a big fan of meal interruptions by wait staff, who are hawking add-ons for supper.

The tapas in general are good and very nicely presented.  The short rib was a bit tough and the lamb was very good.\nDo try the corncakes; I think the best of all of the 8 dishes that we tasted.  Do remember to make a reservation.\nWe did have an excelent waiter.
