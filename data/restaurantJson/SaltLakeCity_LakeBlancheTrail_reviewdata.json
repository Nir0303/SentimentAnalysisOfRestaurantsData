There are some seemingly never-ending steep sections so it is not for the faint of heart but if you take your time and enjoy the views it is doable even if you aren't in perfect shape. On the way down, so many people asked us \"How much farther?\"  I think it took us a little less than 3 hrs to get down the next day. We went in May near Memorial Day and it was pretty busy on Memorial Day. Parking spots can be more challenging to find at peak times.  There is a section of the hike where you have to climb some rocks to continue to the path. They aren't difficult but the pathway isn't especially clear and almost appears to end (some people turned around). But DON'T turn around because it is pretty close to the end. Watch the weather because it can get some good thunderstorms and there were still some snowy spots even in late May. It was cold at night (about 20 degrees) so be prepared if camping.
