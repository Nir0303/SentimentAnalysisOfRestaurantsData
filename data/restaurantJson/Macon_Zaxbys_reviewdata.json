I had the Club Basket, which consisted of their delicious chicken fingers on toast with lettuce, tomato (big slices too!), bacon (yummy), American cheese, and a pickle. Great combination; every bite was satisfying. Crinkly fries were good as well. Just wish I would have had the forethought to include some packets of mayo, which if you haven't tried those as a dip for your fries, you absolutely must. Ketchup is out, mayo is in. Trust me on this.\n\nMy friend had a Kids Meal of chicken fingers with Zak sauce, which serves as her choice of french fry dip.\n\nWe both enjoyed our meals and the total bill only came to $10.50 plus tax. Not too bad at all. Cheap date.\n\nHere's a tip. Take your bag to go, and head on over to the Ocmulgee Heritage Trail, with the entrance just a block or so down the road. Find a picnic bench and enjoy the peaceful scenery while you eat your delicious meal.
