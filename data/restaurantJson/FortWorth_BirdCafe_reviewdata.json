Requested the patio and we were promptly seated.  Waitress was polite and took our drink orders.  We ordered caesar salad, cheese and meat tray, plus steak tartare.  We waited over 25 minutes for a dry, tasteless salad that virtually had no dressing and only croutons.  Not a good start.  We then waited over 30 more minutes for our entrees (neither required cooking).  Had to track down the waitress and she apologized for delay.  I stated we needed to leave in about 20 minutes due to another engagement.  She said she was not sure if she could get the food to us in time.  I told her to just bring me a check for the drinks and salad.  She then returned with the food in a to go bag and informed us that the manager comped the food.  I had to throw my food away as I had to nowhere to store raw meat.  My girlfriend opened her meal and saw the meat and cheese included bologna (unbelievable)!!\n\nI personally rank this as one of the WORST dining experiences ever in my life and we eat out a LOT!  I strongly encourage everyone to find somewhere else to eat when in Sundance Square Fort Worth!

There are great seats inside, both upstairs and down, as well as outside.  Service is good and prices are reasonable.  The menu is consistently broad with a few chalkboard specials nightly.  The concept of sharing is gradually catching on and the small plate selection at Bird helps.  Take a moment to walk around looking at the many framed paintings of birds hanging on the walls.
