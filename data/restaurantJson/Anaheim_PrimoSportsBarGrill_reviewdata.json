We had reservations for 530pm and the place was not busy. I do not understand why waiters feel the need to not write your order down. Our waiter forgot my friend's wine and we needed to ask twice for her to get it. They served my soup at the same time as my meal so the mussels got cold while I tried to finish the soup that wasn't that hot to begin with. They forgot the bacon for another friend's burger. And our one friend who doesn't like seafood ordered a burger with only meat and bread. They brought it out with melted cheese on it and because he didn't write down what she said the order was wrong. They redid the burger and when she cut it in half it was very rare and she ordered well done. So they took it back again. By the time the rest of us were done with our food, the third burger came out. She cut it in half and it was more rare then the 2nd burger, literally red juice coming out and the kitchen didn't believe her that it wasn't well done and asked the waiter to show them. Ridiculous! They took the burger off the bill and asked her if she wanted anything else but we had to leave. Poor service and lukewarm food, will not be coming back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-11-16T19:23:35-0500", "location_id": "7697436", "id": "327286141", "user": {"username": "melobeam", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Found it thru the OpenTable", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29092-d7697436-r303904533-m11068-Primo_Sports_Bar_Grill-Anaheim_California.html#review303904533", "text": "Chicken (cut in small cubes) in the salad had no taste and no value, so the salad is hugely overpriced, to my opinion.
