We visited there for lunch today. They feature freshly grilled meats and seafood. My wife hade a carne asada tostada salad and I had two cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. The quality of the ingredients in the dishes was quite high. My wife thought her salad was pretty good. My enchiladas were served barely warm, with all inside chees and red sauce topping barely warm. Maybe cheese enchiladas weren't the thing to order at a grill! The whole beans and rice were very good. Probably nothing exciting enough about the visit to make us want to return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-03T14:39:21-0400", "location_id": "10689213", "id": "401037874", "user": {"username": "billp77", "user_location": {"name": "tucson", "id": null}}}]}
