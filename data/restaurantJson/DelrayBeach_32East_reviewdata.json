To the restaurant's credit, service well-paced on a very busy Friday night. Food was solid but nothing special. Fish entree was tasty and, to our delight, served appropriately hot. If a convenient destination, not a bad choice. But not one to seek out because of its fine food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-18T05:28:08-0400", "location_id": "403496", "id": "393890407", "user": {"username": "susan j", "user_location": {"name": "Baltimore, Maryland", "id": "60811"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Enjoyable", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34179-d403496-r393708252-m11068-32_East-Delray_Beach_Florida.html#review393708252", "text": "I purchased a $75.00 Groupon so that it made it easier on the pocket.

He had to ask the chef about the substitution and came back after 10 minutes or so with the offer to substitute with broccolini.  That was fine with me, but there is a sense that substitutions are are not taken kindly to at the restaurant.
