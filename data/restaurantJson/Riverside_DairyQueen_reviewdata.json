I actually love standing in line because there's always a line for this DQ. The ice cream treats are so delicious and you can ask them to modify it just the way you like it. Extra caramel? No problem. Extra-extra caramel? Not a problem! Wow! For us caramel lovers, it is pure heaven. Plus the ice cream is so smooth and delicious, how can you lose?

Not sure what happened last night. Ordered a chocolate chip banana malt. The banana was in chunks not blended. I couldn't taste the malt if there was any in it, even though asked for a double shot. And there was a random cherry in it. Red food dye is toxic and many people react adversely to it. It was very busy so could not determine which employee was making my order. Topped with whip cream without asking if it was wanted. Which I didn't. It was to go so didn't discover this all until left the location.
