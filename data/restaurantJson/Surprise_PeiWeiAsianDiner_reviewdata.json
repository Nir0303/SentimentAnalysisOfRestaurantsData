The food is always freshly cooked and brought to your table immediately.  The four of us had extremely great meals.  If you go early during non-snowbird season, you can avoid a crowd. Very clean restaurant and a very friendly staff to serve you. They even have sizes of meals that you can order. Small for the light eater and original for those who want to take home a baggie.
