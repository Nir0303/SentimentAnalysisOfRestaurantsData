The food was overall very good and with a tremendous selection.  They had a dozen meats/entrees. The lasagna was great, as was the sausage with kraut. The sage stuffing and macaroni salad were also wonderful. The mac and cheese disappointed - quite bland, not much cheese.  \nI wish I had more time and a larger stomach. The ribs looked and smelled very good, but I had to say no.\nThe buffet, drink and tip for under 12 dollars is great!
