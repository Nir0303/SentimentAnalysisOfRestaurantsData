Very special touch to a most special experience! My husband was thrilled with the extensive and upscale bar offerings. He had a delicious raspberry chicken Brie dish. I had amazing rack of lamb. Servings were very generous. We finished the evening with scrumptious house-made pecan pie. Sitting outside on a beautiful summer evening was so very pleasant.

Wait staff was a little slow, but the food was great.  Started with a crab cake appetizer.  Two big cakes filled with crab and a little spicy bite to it.  Next, the salmon in papillote.  Served with polenta and mixed veggies, it was quite good.  Started with a French onion soup that was served with a pair of scissors (to cut the long strands of cheese).  Never saw that before.  Music supplied by a gentleman on piano.  Add a nice bottle of wine and you're in for a nice evening.  Dinners will run about $25-30 plus wine.  Not \"cheap\" but worth it.

We booked the wine cellar room weeks in advance and were assured they could handle dinner for a group of our size (about 25).\n\nWe arrived on time at 7:30. The server assigned to our side of the room took more than a half hour to take our drink orders, and then another half hour to order dinner.\n\nThe front two tables apparently received decent service, receiving their drinks, appetizers, salads, bread, and dinner in a timely manner. The back two tables, however, did not receive their entrees until after the front tables were completely finished eating. They never received bread at all, and their dinners came so late that the staff was pushing them to rush through their food because the restaurant was closing at 10 (2.5 hours after the group arrived).\n\nAdditionally, the food took so long that the kitchen ran out of both the starch and vegetable of the day. This is understandable- it happens when restaurants are busy, but the server did not notify the \"late\" eating tables of the change, and surprised several people with food they could not eat due to dietary restrictions.\n\nThe server also failed to be attentive and on the one occasion he bothered to refill water glasses for the neglected back tables, he seemingly intentionally skipped over people with obviously empty glasses.\n\nHad we been at a diner, family restaurant, or other casual venue, none of this would have been as upsetting. However, given the price ($30/entree) and atmosphere of the restaurant,  we were incredibly disappointed with our evening.\n\nMaybe the restaurant is enjoyable if  you come as a couple or a group of four. But the restaurant should not advertise its ability to accommodate large groups if it cannot follow through with adequate service.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "KentShuff, Owner at Vera Mae&#39;s Bistro, responded to this review", "text": "It's best to apologize for our perceived shortcomings and carry on.
