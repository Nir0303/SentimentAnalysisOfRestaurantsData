Last year we had problems with the way they were putting out boiled shrimp in cold water that was melted ice that had not been refreshed. We felt it was dangerous to have this type of seafood out without proper cooling, i.e. On a bed of ice and was an invitation to getting sick. \nWell, this time was even worse, not only was there no ice but they were putting boiled shrimp out on a bed of lettuce! There were other shrimp concoctions in what looked like watered down seafood sauce as well. We looked around and they had in fact, at 7pm, very little food out and there was very limited seafood for an advertised seafood buffet. They did not have near the selections they had a year ago, including frog legs, gumbo, broiled talapia, fried catfish or several other speciality seafood dishes. They did not even have prime rib or grilled ribs but instead looked like they replaced them with a pork roast which not one was getting. Their selection of vegetables were also limited and many of them looked as though they had not been refreshed in hours, with the buffet just starting at 5pm. Examples of this problem were a salad bowl almost devoid of any salad lettuce and a pan of corn on the cob with only 2 pieces in it! \nThe only positive thing about the entire buffet was the crab legs which were very good. I guess if you want to go and pay $25 for just crab legs you might enjoy the buffet. I was somewhat disgusted to see several tables of people bringing multiple plates of crab legs to their table piled 8 to 10 inches high and literally making gluttons out of themselves. But then again, I guess that is the risk that you run at any buffet and that is the disgusting side of human nature - greed! \nAll in all, this is not a buffet that we will be returning to due to the poor selection and improperly presented food such as the boiled shrimp. Additionally, this casino use to give military a nice and much appreciated discount with this being a military town and area but management, we were told, has stopped this practice.
