Both were really good and I recommended this place to many friends! \n\nMost recently when I went and got my beloved soup, it was not great... The baked potato soup was super thick almost like a porridge. It was hard for my boyfriend to finish his. The crackers on the table were stale and tasked really bad. We also had a sandwich that was really bland. \n\nI will probably give this place another try, but ask to have a sample before ordering any soups. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-07-26T09:52:13-0400", "location_id": "3731968", "id": "169175462", "user": {"username": "casualfoodie11", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-12", "title": "Great Soup, Great Prices, Great Addition To Downtown Kenosha", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60003-d3731968-r148503443-m11068-Uncanny_Soup_Company-Kenosha_Wisconsin.html#review148503443", "text": "Stopped by the Uncanny Soup Company on New Year's Eve after having seen an article about them in the local paper. The place is small - like three tables small, and my guess is that it's always going to be pretty packed. Good news is that you can get everything to go. \n\nThey serve four soups every day; 13 Spice Jambalaya, Loaded Baked Potato, Chicken Vegetable and Sirloin Chili. They also have between 4 - 6 special soups that appear to rotate on a weekly basis. (You can download the monthly menu from their web site.) We tried the 13 Spice Jambalaya, the Loaded Baked Potato and a daily special, a vegetarian Masala Curry, among my party or four. \n\nI'd rate the Jambalaya and the Curry as outstanding. The Jambalaya is very spicy, but the heat doesn't come at the expense of flavor. As someone born and raised in the South I can attest that it hits every note expected of this classic New Orleans favorite. \n\nFrom one taste, it was clear that the Curry base was from a handmade spice mix - not from a jar or can. It had a mellow smokiness and was packed with rice, chickpeas and veggies - absolutely perfect for a cold winter lunch.\n\nWhile the Loaded Potato was sufficient and nonetheless filling, we agreed that it wasn't terribly exciting or flavorful. \n\nThey also serve hot sandwiches that, from what we could spy on the table next to us, were large and tasty. \n\nWe purchased two quarts of soup to go and a jar of the owner's homemade Muffalata before departing. We'll be back. In fact I can see making a weekly trip to the Uncanny Soup Company!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-01-01T05:58:50-0500", "location_id": "3731968", "id": "148503443", "user": {"username": "jerrySF", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco", "id": null}}}]}
