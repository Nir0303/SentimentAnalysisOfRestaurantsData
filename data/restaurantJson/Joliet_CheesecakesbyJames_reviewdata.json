It has a nice neon sign - so pay attention and try it out.\n\nWe wanted to stop in, but the local businesses in the Joliet downtown area close at 6:00 pm, so we have missed trying this place out.  Tonight, we got an early start, and we finally got there and tried it out.\n\nGood cheesecake.  Really Good cheesecake!\n\nJames (of Cheesecakes by James) actually works here as the manager and the cook.  To say he is invested in this place would be an understatement - he seems to live for his cooking.  \n\nYou could taste that in his cheesecakes.  We both went with the Raspberry, and I could taste the real raspberry in the cheesecake.\n\nThe prices range from $4 for a slice of plain, up to $6.25 for a slice of Triple Chocaolate.  24 hour notice is requested for whole cakes, with 8 and 10 inch versions available for most of his 9 flavors.\n\nI'm glad we stopped - we'll be back.  Give this place a try - get to Tin Roof, Juliets, Chicken N Spice, or Chicago Pub and Grill, and take a side trip down Cass.  Get there before 6 pm, and get an excellent slice of dessert!  Better yet, buy a slice of each, and post your own review.
