We eat a lot of Panda Express but this is much better (and a little more expensive but worth it.) Favorite dish was Mongolian Beef.  Tucked behind some other strip mall businesses it's a bit hard to find.  Would visit again when in the area for this quality Asian fast food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-02-08T23:46:39-0500", "location_id": "5106074", "id": "253302557", "user": {"username": "SJSharkFan", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}]}
