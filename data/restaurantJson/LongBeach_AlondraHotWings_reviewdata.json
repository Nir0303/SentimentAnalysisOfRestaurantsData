Ordered the honey BBQ and something from their secret menu called Arlene. Some kind of semi-spicy lemon sauce that was created by an employee Wayback when. that one is very recommended. Also, the pulled pork french fries are pretty interesting. The french fries and the pulled pork are deep-fried. It leaves the pulled pork a little on the dry side but, they mix it with their coleslaw and it comes out a little wetter and interesting. The service is a little on the slow side but, they tried to be as accommodating as possible and they are quite friendly. Ultimately, I recommend you stay to the hot wings menu. It appears that the rest of the menu, according to other reviews is nominal at best. Additionally,The oil they use for deep frying it is peanut oil. The hot wings are not dipped in flour.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-08-28T19:05:24-0400", "location_id": "3878984", "id": "412069301", "user": {"username": "Teddytoons", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Wy more than just wings!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32648-d3878984-r375430962-m11068-Alondra_Hot_Wings-Long_Beach_California.html#review375430962", "text": "I was in town for business and decided to wander away from the beach to avoid the touristy chain places.

I figured I should get wings after all the waitress recommended a sauce that is not even on the menu. I forget what it was called but ask for the house specialty sauce. Sort of a cross between buffalo medium and lemon pepper. How many places have baked brussel sprouts as a side. They were great too.
