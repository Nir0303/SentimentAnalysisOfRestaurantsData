I always look at the dates of the reviews to get an idea if the bad is current or in the past.  I've only eaten breakfast here and I've visited 6 times.  Overall the breakfast meals are what I'd call average to average plus.  The servings are adequate and have always been hot and cooked how I ordered.  The cream gravy is a little on the weak side for a mix, I suspect, but above par for the course for most restaurants.  I could be wrong but the biscuits seemed to be the already cooked and reheated type and did not taste to be freshly baked.  A simple buttermilk or heavy cream biscuit recipe is 4-6 ingredients and not difficult to make or time consuming.  I'll visit again and if you are in the area and hungry for a sit down traditional American breakfast, give it a try.  You may think the quality is better than my rating.  More of a home town restaurant atmosphere as the times I've visited there are people at different tables who speak to each other.  Worth a try.  I've eaten pancakes and bacon, eggs and bacon with crispy hashbrowns the way I like them and I've ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast a couple of times.
