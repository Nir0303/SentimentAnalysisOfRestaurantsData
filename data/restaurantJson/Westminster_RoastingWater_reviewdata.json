Who doesn't want their drink in an cute bottle. Prices aren't even bad they are similar to what other boba places are charging with out a collector bottles. The drinks are very good so that is a win cute and tasty. They have many options to choose from, a wide range, tea, milk tea, slushies, smoothies, etc. Came here twice my last visit to Socal.

This place is a technically a boba house, but what I really love about it is that there is such a variety of people that come here, I never feel awkward ordering my drink. Other boba houses I've been too make feel as though I stick out and shouldn't be there, being I'm a \"white girl\" who likes boba drinks.\n\nNow speaking of their drinks, I'm definitely a tea girl and I love their teas are brewed creations instead of sugary powders mixed into waters. They also include familiar and exotic fruit pieces in their teas and several different additives similar to boba which is super unique and yummy. \n\nAlso I am in LOVE with the cups this place uses. They now switch up styles every week or two and they are either adorable glass jars sealed with a cork, or the new reusable sport containers they've introduced. Either way you get a cute cup and a delicious drink! Go check it out. There is also now a location in garden grove, Chapman and Brookhurst near the Regal Cinemas.

We wanted some drinks and I had seen a lot of people post Instagram worthy pictures from Roasting Water so we decided to try it out. The business is located where there is a lot of parking so parking isn't an issue but the business itself does not have a lot of sitting room. They have seating for 8-10 people (4-5 tables) and there usually is a line. The drinks are really good and they come at very decent price. I wouldn't say that these drinks are expensive at all. I had the white peach lemonade and it was great. I also go boba with my drink and the boba pearls were perfect. My roommate got the oolong milk tea and she really enjoyed it. Everyone who ordered a drink was completely satisfied with our drinks (we were even joking about going back to get more when we finished our drinks in the parking lot). The drinks come in these cute jars with cork tops so when you finally get your drink, don't forget to snap a picture to show the world.
