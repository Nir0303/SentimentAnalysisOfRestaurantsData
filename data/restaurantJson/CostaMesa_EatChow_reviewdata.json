This place is so AMAZING!   It's hard to find since you can't see it from Newport Blvd (it's visible from W 18th St), but if you can find this hidden gem you definitely need to scope it out!  It's very small inside and doesn't seat a lot, but if you come early, you're good to go.  \n\nI came here in a Wednesday night around 5:30 PM, and it wasn't busy.  I was seated right away and the service was on top of it.  The soup of the day was lentil soup (yum!), so it already got me excited about dinner.  I don't recall the name of our service staff members that helped us, but it was one of the best service I've ever received.  Water glasses were never empty, they checked up on us enough times without being annoyingly frequent, and they were so hospitable and friendly throughout the whole dining experience.\n\nWhat I Ordered:\nSweet potato fries ($5.50): Delicious!  It was topped with cotija cheese and a side of ketchup.\nLentil soup ($6 for a bowl, $4 for a cup): Nice and hot for a cold California night.  There were enough lentils in there so you know that you're getting your fiber and protein kick and enough soup to make it take oh so good.\nFrench Dip ($13): Very good!  Not the best I ever had as the meat was a bit dryer than I anticipated, but after dipping it in the au jus, it just made it that much better.  I'd probably give this 4/5.  Still nice and juicy when you dip it!  this comes with a side of mixed greens or Caesar salad.\n\nMy friend had the Chicken Curry Salad, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  He said he loved the curry dressing, as it had the right amount of spice.  Appetizers were under $6, most entrees loomed between $10-$17, and desserts were around $8.  \n\nNow that I know dinner is legit, I have to come here for breakfast one day.  Or even have a burger there for lunch.  Everything on the menu looks soooo good!  The noise level can be a bit high, and the table s are thisclose to each other, so it may not provide you the best intimate conversations with whoever you come with.  However, the ambiance is quite trendy and nice.  Highly recommend if you like a diverse menu of goodness and awesome, top notch service!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-12-01T19:24:47-0500", "location_id": "1238488", "id": "330251878", "user": {"username": "buffy0182", "user_location": {"name": "Costa Mesa, California", "id": "32253"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Sunday fun day", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32253-d1238488-r329732435-m11068-Eat_Chow-Costa_Mesa_California.html#review329732435", "text": "Great breakfast menu!
