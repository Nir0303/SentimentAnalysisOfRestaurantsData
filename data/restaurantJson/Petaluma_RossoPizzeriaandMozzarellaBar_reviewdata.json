The host, Michael, was friendly and engaging, and answered all our touristy questions about Petaluma and the area knowledgeably and amiably. Our waitress was fast, professional, and like Michael, very down-to-earth and personable.\nI ordered the Capri or Caprese salad. It was beautiful and delicious! There were big pieces of the restaurant's own homemade mozzarella in it... they were like white chicken chunks coated in tasty dressing-- meaty, chewy, and flavorful, yet of course not meat (necessary for a vegetarian like me)! The fresh tomatoes and cucumber curls were mouth-watering.\nOn the side, i had a piece of the pizzetta flatbread. It was like the Lacey's cookie of the savory world: delicately thin, crispy, combo of flour crust and (in places where the dough was so wispy as to disappear) toasted cheese. With the perfect flavorful herb dusting over all.\nMy partner got himself a mushroomy, meaty pizza (can't remember its name) which he declared excellent.\nThe waitress suggested an $8 Sangiovese red to go with my meal... while it was stated that the wine choices change often to go with the seasons, and this one might not be the one they offer next month, i just wanted to note that it was an excellent recommendation. It was sweet and juicy-fruity without being cloying or thick... just the right blend of sweet and dry/spicy.\nAnd the water was clean, without a taste of chlorine!\nAlthough the place was spendy enough that i probably would not make an everyday habit of going there if i lived nearby, i'd be sorely tempted.

Both TV and loud music.  Don't go if you plan to have a conversation.\nThe service:  We arrived at 5PM and only a few tables were taken.  It still took over an hour to get our entrees.  After more than half an hour the server appeared to say they were out of the special risotto with short ribs, and we could have polenta or pasta instead.  Why would they be out of a special before 6 in the evening, and why would it take so long to realize they were out of it? \n I asked if they had herb tea, and the server said they did. I expected to get a selection of teas, as often happens.  Instead she just brought the tea. When I asked what kind it was, she replied, \"Herb tea.\"  \nThe food:  The butter lettuce with apple and blue cheese was gritty/sandy.  Even inexpensive chain restaurants manage to wash the lettuce.  Is that too much to ask for a $12 salad?   The pizza and the polenta were both mediocre.  \nSummary:  over-priced, very slow service, noisy", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-11-23T19:10:16-0500", "location_id": "4572319", "id": "328715631", "user": {"username": "Roseleaf", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "In a \"foodie\" city, this was not spectacular", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32874-d4572319-r328659301-m11068-Rosso_Pizzeria_and_Mozzarella_Bar-Petaluma_Sonoma_County_California.html#review328659301", "text": "The waiter was wonderful.
