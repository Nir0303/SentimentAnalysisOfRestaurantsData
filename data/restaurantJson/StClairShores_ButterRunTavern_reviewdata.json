They have 300 bottles in their collection and many of my old favorites.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to get the list (more than 20 minutes), and it took forever to get my selection.  The bar tender and the server both seemed new and had no sense of urgency.  Perhaps, that is why no one in the place was drinking whiskey, despite the impressive list.  Our cocktails were really watery.  My suspicion is that the very long time that it took to get them allowed the ice to melt too much.  It is a nice space, but the decoration is just not quite right.

Sent out to the grocery store to pick up some butter, Grandpa suggested they stop for a brew or two at Pat O'Brien's bar in St. Clair Shores.  Pat O'Brien's became Butter Run Saloon and a butter run came to mean stopping by for a drink or two.  \n\nButter Run boasts more whiskey varieties than any other bar in Michigan.  They have 19 beer selections on tap.  The place is small but cozy with bar seating as well as table and high-top seating.  Butter Run's d\u00e9cor is kitschy and appealing, with memorabilia hanging on walls, tucked in a glass case and decorating glass-topped window-box like table tops.  Lakeview High School yearbooks from previous years lean in a stack on the window sill.  Anyone wanting to part with their yearbook may want to add it to the collection.  \n\nThis is a fun place for breakfast or lunch.  The food is good, the prices are competitive and the service is attentive.  Music plays in the background but the sound level easily allows conversations with your table companions.\n\nI tried the Slim Jim special with fries.  It was meatier than the Big Boy standard and quite good.  My friends enjoyed Beef Barley soup, a cheeseburger bacon Club Sandwich and a lite plate, featuring a hamburger patty, cottage cheese and tomatoes.  \n\nLocated on the southeast corner of 11 Mile and Harper, Butter Run Saloon is a  regular hangout for my brothers and their friends.  I enjoyed my first visit and  I'm sure we'll be back.  I really like the ambiance.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-03-29T09:46:43-0400", "location_id": "3666278", "id": "262474786", "user": {"username": "pasiphae", "user_location": {"name": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "id": null}}}]}
