Or you can order to go either in the drive through or at the shorter line in the restaurant. \nThe tacos are pretty huge and priced about right at about $5 a piece. The handmade tortillas are good, the meat selection and toppings are extensive. Grab a menu before you get in line so you'll be ready to order when you get to the cashier. We liked the guacamole and handmade tortilla chips.The chips are light and warm and they give you a whole basket of them with your order. The guacamole is a bit on the salty side (which we liked) but if you don't, then go for the queso dip instead. The college crowd all seemed to order the dip but it looked a bit too cheesy for me. There is a salsa and condiment bar that you can select from and one of those newer drink machines. I tend not to like those machines as much because when you want just a simple plain Coke or Pepsi, it seems like the flavor of another type seeps in your drink as bit. They also had iced tea.\nThe second time we went, we had the breakfast tacos. These are pretty filled with chorizo and egg, or eggs, potato and meats, and are pretty inexpensive.for the size.\nIt is a little hard finding the place (when we used our GPS and the construction going on on University Ave) but once you do, it is worth the trip and wait.
