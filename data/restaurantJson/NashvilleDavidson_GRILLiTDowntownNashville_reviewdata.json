Located in downtown a couple blocks from the Capitol, this little place serves decent food and is one of only a couple quick service eateries in downtown to stay open into the early evening. The menu board is confusing when you first walk in, but from what I found out, you don't have to do it the way they suggest. Just talk to the friendly person behind the counter. I was a bit disappointed when I ordered a grilled chicken breast and instead of throwing one on the open flamed grill, she reached in and pulled one from a container on the steam table and proceeded to chop it up in little pieces.  It was OK, but didn't have that sought-after grilled taste to it. The grilled veggies were a bit soggy as well. Would I eat there again? Yes, because as I said, if you are hungry, it is 7 pm and you are downtown and don't want to go to a sit-down restaurant, this is probably the best choice you have at that hour.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-10-24T06:58:38-0400", "location_id": "4842737", "id": "236042812", "user": {"username": "Tim O", "user_location": {"name": "Nashville, Tennessee", "id": "55229"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Quick, delicious, healthy", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55229-d4842737-r211276456-m11068-GRILLiT_Downtown_Nashville-Nashville_Tennessee.html#review211276456", "text": "Very pleasantly surprised by this fast-casual restaurant.  I went to the downtown Nashville location, but I understand they are also in a few other areas and cities.  The concept is similar to a few other places, with a fully custom grid menu, all-natural/organic meats, and an array of locally-sourced veggies.  What really sets GrillIt apart is the wide assortment of options, the unique flavors, and the amazing sauces.\n\nThe menu starts with a base (wrap, rice, pasta, quinoa, or salad) to which you add ingredients and if desired one or more meats.\n\nFor meats, they have four kinds of chicken (original, honey garlic, chipotle, and all-breast), organic, naturally-raised Angus steak, and seared shrimp.\n\nFor salads, you choose any or all of four kinds of lettuce (romaine, spring mix, kale, spinach).  If you like rice, they have yellow, cilantro lime, caribbean, and brown (it's so hard to find brown rice at restaurants).  If you like pasta, they have regular and whole grain.\n\nThere are 28 ingredients/toppings to choose from.  Depending on what you order, you get some number included, with a small upcharge if you go over.\n\nMy personal favorite is a custom salad with mostly romaine, some spring mix, and a touch of kale (no spinach), with steak, and feta cheese, banana peppers, diced tomatoes, diced cucumbers, diced sweet bell peppers (yellow and red), cilantro, and chick peas (garbonzo beans).  Sometimes I get guacamole instead of cilantro.  By itself this is satisfying and tasty, but what really makes it awesome is that in lieu of dressing, I get curry mustard sauce tossed in.  Oh, man, that is delicious.  It's also huge, and inexpensive.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-06-20T15:00:07-0400", "location_id": "4842737", "id": "211276456", "user": {"username": "JetBoys", "user_location": {"name": "South Pole", "id": "669046"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Decent Salad", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55229-d4842737-r211106211-m11068-GRILLiT_Downtown_Nashville-Nashville_Tennessee.html#review211106211", "text": "Good salad, very nice/friendly staff.
