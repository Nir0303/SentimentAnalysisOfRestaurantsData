It's between 130 and 129th street on Hawthorne Avenue, Hawthorne CA near LAX, and because of recent street improvements you have to take a little side-street, easy to miss, into this small shopping mall. The proprietor told us that until recently she just had a few tables; recently she's expanded into a slightly  larger space. It's a costly gamble but I'm certain she will succeed simply because of the quality of her food. My group of five ordered Teriyaki Chicken, Pad Thai with chicken, Pad Thai with Tofu, chicken fried rice and pineapple rice. Every dish was absolutely delicious, and $7.95 which is a true bargain. The restaurant is very clean,  with tasteful food that's  beautifully and simply presented. The recent expansion means you can probably find a seat, but this restaurant sees to have a very large take-out clientele so it's understandably busy. Sometimes you find a place that has the combination of ambiance (very simple!) and accommodation, and you really want them to succeed.I plan to take my group for supper on Sunday as well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-02-26T21:00:46-0500", "location_id": "7746016", "id": "256632864", "user": {"username": "sleepycat69", "user_location": {"name": "minnesota", "id": null}}}]}
