Do not let the strip mall exterior put you off - once you walk in, the owners have done their best to produce a soothing environment with warm gingery walls, and have taken pains to install drapes, blinds & frost the entry door.  No, it's not the rarified atmosphere of an elite Hong Kong Hotel, but it has its own charm. It definitely has remnants of another restaurant from another era, but having been part of that older era, I personally liked the mix of old & new.\nDespite having been sat after a large party of 20 plus, we were served fairly quickly with beverages and placed an appetizer order of Crab Rangoon and Potstickers (anything dimsum-related gets my attention); sadly, they ran out of Potstickers, which I blame on the large party before us. We substituted Spring Rolls, which were definitely handmade, filled with shredded vegetables and bean threads, served quite hot in the rice paper wrapper. The Crab Rangoon was crispy, and the filling was the old-fashioned, classic savory combination of cream cheese and real crab. It compared so very well to the recent trend of the local Chinese restaurants substituting surimi crab and sweetening the cream cheese. Lesson to local delivery: No substitution for simple quality ingredients, my friends. \nWashing the appetizers down with cold Sapporo beer and the owner's blend of jasmine & oolong tea, served in comforting ribbed white tea cups completed a very satisfactory appetizer course. By the way, the owner has a right to be proud of that simple beverage - the tea was lovely copper hued infusion,  lightly brisk, astringent, bright and floral with a dry finish. Lipton it is not.\n\nEntrees were shared, and the Bulgogi bento box was quite generous - not only do you get a bento box filled with house made cucumber pickle, radish pickle, kimchi, and whatever else the chef wants to give you as banchan ( Korean side dishes), you get a nice plate of the bulgogi on the side, a well-marinated, plate of beef, cut paper thin & seared at high heat or on a BBQ. it was prettily presented on a bed of fried rice noodles, the whiteness & texture of the noodles setting off the deep brown of the moist meat wafers. I was a little disappointed to not get lettuce leaves to wrap the morsels, but I made do with the iceberg lettuce tucked underneath the banchan as a garnish. Again, I blame the large party ahead of us. Shameful of them to eat all my lettuce - I am sure Bourdain would have a snarky comment, so I'll settle for a note to self: Always ask for lettuce when ordering Bulgogi. \nWe were told that one selection, Jumbon soup noodle, would take too long to make, so, with the evil large party holding sway over the kitchen, we settled for a seafood Chow Fun - a wide flat noodle, similar to tagliatelle, stir fried with shrimp, scallops and mixed vegetables in a deep, darkly rich sauce with a touch of chili. A side bowl of rice for the table was also brought to round out the meal. The Chow Fun was a nicely substantial dish for a cool autumn evening, the sauce slowly became more complex as we ate into the dish, but sadly, the scallops were missing. I will make one comment about rice here: It was rice. You know, that glutinous, sticky, steamed & re-steamed unto death grain you get in any eatery in the bistate area. ( At times, I wonder if Calrose gives kickbacks..) - wouldn't it be great if some restaurant owner broke the mold and gave its humblest dish as much attention as its finest creations? There are hundreds of brands of appetizing Asian rice & American varieties of jasmines and basmatis that would really elevate the dishes served. \nThat being said, service was good, obviously tested by said evil large party, but we were served our entrees in a timely manner, and the manager/owner certainly was very pleasant to speak with; it may have been a stressful night in the kitchen, but we felt nothing but relaxed and comfortably full from a kitchen who obviously takes pride in fresh food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2014-10-04T19:56:31-0400", "location_id": "4953076", "id": "232623681", "user": {"username": "christine s", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "id": "44881"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "Try the Bento Box", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44737-d4953076-r209747791-m11068-Vince_s_Asian_Bistro-O_Fallon_Missouri.html#review209747791", "text": "This is our favorite Chinese/Asian restaurant in St. Charles county.

NOT fancy place, but delicious food and very friendly service.  For those of you who used to travel to the Mandarin House on Page near I-170, the owner used to be the owner of the Mandarin House, and he brought all his recipes!  It lacks the huge lazy susans and fancier decor, but the food is the FLAVOR we remember.   Tonight, when my brother mentioned that he had brought me and implied that now I will bring my large family (I will), the owner brought out desserts for us to taste on him.  :-)   WONDERFUL mango pudding...and a decadent chocolate cake.   I had the mu shu pork...great plum sauce and  generous servings of pork.   There was plenty of food to eat tonight and take home a box for tomorrow.   Family enjoyed the Mandarin Beef, Kung Pao chicken, and they made up a Happy Family (even though it wasn't on the menu).  We loved the crab rangoon and the sizzling rice soup.
