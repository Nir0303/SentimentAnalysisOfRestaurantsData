Brand new shop just opened up on the corner of Euclid and Transit and they serve fresh fruit, smoothies, ice cream, goodies, and some food, as well. So far I've only had the small fruit bowl and I am already a regular!  Friends have tried other items and desserts and report back that everything is as tasty as the fruit bowls (called a Pico de Gallo).   \n\nThey make it to order, fresh right there.  Mine had mango, pineapple, cucumber, watermelon, and oranges.  I asked her to hold the jicama today.  I like mine with lemon, salt and chili powder... my mouth waters just thinking about it.  I'm sure I'll try some other items, but right now I am just so excited to find an easy in and out place that sells me amazing fruit for $5!   \n\nSo far, I have noted that they are open by 8am (maybe earlier, but that's when I arrive) and still open when I leave at 6, so the hours are all day.  Also, it's cute inside; set up with kind of like a bistro look to it.  High ceilngs in a historic building, comfy chairs, and bistro tables, a clean ladies room, and tasty food?  SOLD!\n\nI am hoping they stick around, so GO HERE!  It's very yummy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-23T12:37:54-0400", "location_id": "8389608", "id": "282448616", "user": {"username": "ladyjadegd", "user_location": {"name": "Escondido, California", "id": "32358"}}}]}
