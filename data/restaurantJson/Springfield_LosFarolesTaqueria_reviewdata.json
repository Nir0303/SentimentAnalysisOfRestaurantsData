The staff was so friendly, the service FAST, the prices very reasonable and the food.....AWESOME!!!!!   We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was!  I had a fish burrito and chips and salsa.  My husband had a 2 item combo which he chose, 3 chicken taquitos & cheese enchilada w/rice and beans, as well as a chicken Sope and a soda.  Everything was delicious!  We decided that this is the closest we've come to the food we used to get in San Diego!  We will make this \"our\" place for Mexican food for now on!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-28T15:43:11-0400", "location_id": "10790967", "id": "412036425", "user": {"username": "Pam R", "user_location": {"name": "Eugene, Oregon", "id": "51862"}}}]}
