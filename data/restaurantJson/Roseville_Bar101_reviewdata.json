Good portions and the food was delicious. My only gripe is that the chips included in the salad were overly salty. Overall, we had a great experience and will be back!

I read another review... it's NOT your regular bar fare. It's better. It's fresher. They have amazing salads. They make their own dressings. They slow cook their meats.

If you ever are in the area and want a good burger and brew, even for lunch!! Go here. They have every sporting event on for every season. Friendly owners (Manny and Shaleen) Amazing Staff (Jim) and even more so... AWESOME regulars. Don't let the name fool you. Unless it's after 9pm, this is a well priced, yummy, family establishment.
