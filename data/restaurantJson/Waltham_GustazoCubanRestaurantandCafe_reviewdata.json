Presentation was nice, every dish was unique, and yet everything hit its own mark perfectly. The small plates really are pretty small, but that just means you get to try more! The bacon-wrapped plantains and PEI mussels may have been my two favorites, but there's certainly a lot to choose from. \n\nAlthough the entree plates were on the small side, the desserts were anything but. Make sure you leave plenty of room! For something unlike any dessert I've ever had, try the Boniatio root. The dulce de leche crepes were phenomenal as well. \n\nThe service was friendly and efficient, and the restaurant is in a very cool space, nicely decorated and well-lit. If anything, it was a little on the loud side, but I thought that just added to a fun, relaxed atmosphere. \n\nThe only drawback to be aware of is a temporary one- since they don't have a liquor license yet, there aren't any fun Caribbean cocktails to complement the meal.

We were given a friendly greeting when we arrived for lunch and promptly seated.  The dining room is beautifully decorated with a copper ceiling, Moroccan lanterns and a full wall covered in authentic (though reduced) Cuban movie posters, the tables covered with authentic Cuban newspaper clippings (in laminate).  It is utterly cool, and totally takes you to another place and time-lunchcation? Our server was excellent, friendly (but not too), helpful (but not pushy), attentive and efficient. The place was packed and she was initially the only server but it always seemed that we were only one of a couple tables for which she was responsible.  She offered suggestions when asked, guiding our choices with skill. On the servers suggestion, we started with the recent menu addition & perfect for summer, Garbanzos con Feta. It is both a delight for the eyes and the mouth. It is a cool salad of garbanzo beans, sofrito, feta cheese, & fresh mangos in a lime-cumin sauce.  It is a taste bud pleasing combination.  The richness of the beans and cheese, played well with the sweetness of the mango and then the lime jumped in and finished every bite off with a tang. I am salivating just writing this.  The Soup du Jour was a Country Lentil with carrots and chorizo, rustic and hearty.  Next came the day Empanadas, one of today's specials was beef and it was pure flaky, meaty goodness. The Frita Cubana is a burger with Spanish chorizo, Gruyere cheese, green leaf, aioli, tomato, caramel iced onions and crispy julienned potatoes on brioche, a safer bet for the less adventurous. It was delicious and messy.  Pavo is a Cuban take on a turkey BLT, with guava marmalade (at this point I was sold!), usually with goat cheese mousse but I opted for Gruyere and at the servers suggestion, had it on multigrain bread.  The sandwich is briefly grilled to obtain cross-hatch marks, but remains a cool sandwich. It is a very nice sandwich, the thick cut crisp bacon & guava marmalade adding something special, however, despite it being very good, there are many better, more \"traditional\" choices. Saving the best sandwich for last, the Cubano did not disappoint. A totally pleasing combination of slow roasted pork, smoked ham, Dijon, pickles, pimenton dulce aioli & Gruyere cheese and a baguette all pressed to perfection. The ingredients meld together, encased in a perfectly crisped baguette. I will never eat a Cubano anywhere else, they have reached perfection, so why seek disappointment? Totally stuffed (& we packed 1/2 of each sandwich to go) we could not pass on dessert. Cafe Bombon (a layer of sweetened condensed milk covered by a shot of espresso and topped with steamed milk is a rich, smooth cup of happiness. The guys both chose the Pudin de Pan (seared bread pudding topped with almond brittle and mocha almond ice cream (my hubby hates coffee and missed this part when reading the menu, however the ice cream had no coffee flavor, more Sweet Cream ice cream with a slight chocolate finish, very nice) drizzled with creme de vie.  They should have split one order. As you can see from the photos, there were 2 generous slices of the bread pudding topped with a tennis ball scoop of the ice cream. It is not your usual bread pudding, be thankful, usual is boring and not nearly as tasty. However, and pay attention!!! If you are broke or not hungry, skip straight to the Churros con Chocolate (& you might even skip the chocolate). These are not your state fair or convenience store Churros, in fact they are not even in the same family. A serving is 4, 1/4 pound hot dog sized Churros served with a pot of rich thick chocolate sauce (enough to share for 2 or 4 who don't dig dessert, is such people exist, and if they do, they are suspect in my book). These Churros are things of fantasy-light, airy, tender, delicate, & crisp, doused in cinnamon sugar. The chocolate is good, but it tends to mask the delicate Churros and you would be a total fool to do that.  Just eat the sauce with a spoon and be done with it.  It is dense and milk chocolatey, but too overwhelming for these delights from heaven. If you cannot tell, I am totally in love with this place and cannot wait to go back for dinner, there are SO many amazing sounding dishes!  I will be back however, and VERY soon.
