We parked in the lot behind the restaurant (off 3rd St.) and entered through the back door. There's a hostess stand there; and the hostess greeted us, got our menus, and started leading us to a table in the front of the restaurant, telling us we could choose wherever we wanted to sit. Obviously, the restaurant wasn't very crowded <grin> even though it was still Happy Hour when we arrived. We seated ourselves as our hostess stopped to talk to a customer (friend?) sitting at a table across from us. She continued chatting with that customer for 3-4 minutes; then returned to her station in the back of the restaurant still carrying our menus with her, sitting in a chair with her back towards us. It took a good 5 minutes to catch the eye of another staff person and motion we needed help. The menus turned out to be quite confusing: once opened, you can't see half the menu while it looks like what you CAN see is all they offer. Our waiter finally showed us the trick it took to see the rest of the menu, saying he often has to do that so customers can see the full menu, which leaves me wondering why they don't just fix the menu...\n\nWe ordered: I ordered Fish & Chips, Hubby ordered the Jameson Chicken Sandwich. We'd also ordered cocktails when he first brought us menus, which hadn't arrived yet. As I said, it was Happy Hour and the restaurant wasn't very crowded, so we'd expected our cocktails to take little time; but when I asked him about the cocktails, he looked up at the bar and said 'oh, they're just pouring them now'. The truth was they WEREN'T pouring them because he'd forgotten to put our drink order in. We finally got our cocktails, which we sipped while waiting what seemed like forever for our meals. Our meals finally arrived: I picked up a piece of fish and it immediately slipped from my fingers, leaving the coating and a lot of grease behind in my hand. I put the fish down to clean my hand and tried a french fry: it, too, was overly greasy to the point of being inedible. I was trying to break off a piece of the bare fish to eat when our waiter returned to see if all was OK. I showed him my plate and even he was embarrassed: He could clearly see the deep-fryer grease dripping from my fingers, dripping from my food, and pooling on my plate...my entire plate was completely inedible. He offered to take my plate back and talk to the chef about it, which was quite appropriate; but then he returned and re-served my same plate, hanging his head and saying the chef refused to do anything about it. Huh? Hubby, in the meantime, had given up on his fries (dripping grease, like mine) and was trying to eat his sandwich; but the chicken breast itself was undercooked and smothered in an oily sauce that best resembled Italian salad dressing. We wound up sending both our plates back to the kitchen, unfinished (mine basically untouched). The bill came: there was a bar bill, which we expected, but no consideration given whatsoever for the bad food. Our waiter apologized left and right...but still demanded the Groupon, of course. We passed him on our way to the back door, leaning against the wall just outside the kitchen door chatting with the hostess (where I know he'd been most of the time we were there, because I could see him from where I was sitting), and he (but not the hostess) thanked us for coming. I replied, \"Thank you for trying...too bad the food was so awful\", and he said \"Yes...sorry again for all the bad food\". That was it.\n\nWill we return? If drinks and dinner were FREE and edible, which is what I think is the least Stout's owes us, maybe...but just maybe. Otherwise, no - I don't like paying for bad dining experiences. I let Groupon know about our visit, too, and agreed to let them forward our bad experience to Stout's and that Stout's could contact me. It's been 3 weeks now, with no contact from Stout's: that if nothing else should tell you how interested they are in customer satisfaction. Bottom line: Don't go there!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-06-19T13:59:28-0400", "location_id": "1491736", "id": "211138254", "user": {"username": "helmerphud", "user_location": {"name": "Sonoma County, Callifornia", "id": null}}}]}
