We stayed for a few hours afterwards drinking and our server asked us to settle our bill and finish with another server. We didn't mind and hoped for better service with the new server but no such luck. It wasn't overly busy but the servers were just overall slack. I served for a few years myself so I understand how things go wrong but it was a general lack of interest and effort on part of both servers.
