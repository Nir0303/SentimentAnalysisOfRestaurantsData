I'm a spring breaker and have seen my share of bad places but this place is really bad. I was in my hotel room and was craving pizza and wanted to watch a basketball game so I Google pizzeria or sports bar in Largo and Eddie' popped up. I saw the photo of the place on Google and it looked nice. Well let me tell you that photo most of been taken 10 years ago because nothing looked the same, it was dirty disgusting crap hole the pizza tasted like frozen cardboard that you would find at a convenient stores freezer for allot less, the tap beer tasted watered down and no it was not Budweiser. I wont say the brand but it does not matter if there running a water line in there kegs. The blackjack tables were on top of old bar stools just balancing on top they were old and disgusting. It looked liked old vomit was stuck to the bar stools and if the main room looks like that I don't want to even think of what the kitchen looks like. I have seen neighborhood hole in the wall places but at least there clean and up to date this place should be shut down and closed. I took 1 bite complained that it was cold paid for my watered down beer and went to McDonald's. Wow..I never post complaints online but this was bad..Oh the cold cardboard pizza with 2 toppings was $33.00. Not a sports bar only had 2 small HD TVs 1 one large outdated rear projector TV showing ESPN. (THAT'S NOT A SPORTS BAR) Serving cold cardboard frozen pizza for $30 (THAT'S NOT A PIZZERIA) You should rename it Eddie's Vomit Hole.\nCELI DONOFRIO Owner", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-04-30T13:51:05-0400", "location_id": "1882547", "id": "159293829", "user": {"username": "Jess H", "user_location": {"name": "Tampa, Florida", "id": "34678"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2012-05", "title": "Dregs of Largo", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34379-d1882547-r145904107-m11068-Eddie_s_Sports_Bar_Grill-Largo_Florida.html#review145904107", "text": "Yeah, normally full of drunken idiots or people who just got out of jail.
