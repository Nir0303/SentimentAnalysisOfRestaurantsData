So yesterday I stopped by at High Point Coffee. My husband said I should try because he liked it a lot. So we stopped by to get some coffee before we headed to a store. We ordered Caramel Karma with extra shot for 24 oz since we wanna shared. Soon as we got the coffee I can't wait to try! Oh my gawd I love it after my first sip! It was smooth and the caramel was just blended so well with the coffee. The extra shot gave more extra special taste to the coffee. I would say this so far my favorite flavor and I definitely will come again for my own Caramel Karma. By the way they also have tea for tea drinkers. From the menu I can see they have green tea, black tea and herbal tea. So I think for people who concerns about their healthy drinks maybe they have something for you. But I highly recommended this place for whoever wanna try High Point Coffee this week!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-03T11:19:16-0400", "location_id": "4929478", "id": "424786296", "user": {"username": "Normaliza I", "user_location": {"name": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "id": "60922"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Small town feel, with BIG time Java!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57166-d4929478-r392598397-m11068-High_Pointe_Coffee-West_Jordan_Utah.html#review392598397", "text": "I love this place!
