This is by far the worst Hilton property i have ever experienced. They charged $300 a night and then another $26 valet parking. I booked the room through the Diamond members desk. When arrived at the hotel i was told there were no room upgrades available and that i had the last room available. The room they gave me was located street side and on the second floor, terrible location. The noice from the traffic on this street goes on all night long, non stop, they even have ear plugs in the room so you cant hear the traffic. You think there would be a disclaimer posted on the website or that the diamond desk would let the customer know about the noise issue. Clearly, the property knows it has an issue with noise, the ear plugs on the desk are proof. For $300 a night, this was an outrage. When I complained to the Diamond Desk they sent an inquiry to the hotel desk about the complaint, i did request a full refund. The hotel sent me an email from MR Sikes, Assistant Front Office Manager to apologize about the room selection and parking, never did he address my complaint about not being able to sleep due to the noise outside my room. I replied to Mr Sikes with a follow up email and he never responded back to me. Nice treatment of a Diamond Member! I would recommend avoiding this property at all costs. I will continue to fight for my refund, which it appears neither Hilton or the property seems to care about.

First off, the staff are exceptional.  From Dana at the front desk, to the young men valet parking cars, to the bartender - everyone was nice, friendly and engaging.  \n\nThe location of the hotel is perfect.  You are in the heart of the historic district, so within walking distance of tons of restaurants, bars and parks.  Because of this, it can be quite noisy at night.  So if you are a light sleeper, or need to be out of the beaten path, this is not the place for you.  The hotel also spells very good.  In the main lobby and up to our floor they have placed air towers throughout the hotel.  I loved the scent.  \n\nThere is a public parking lot across the street from the hotel.  We got lucky - two nights were free for us and the next night we paid the $20 rate.  But it's still cheaper than the hotel's $27/night valet parking. \n\nThe reason I can't give the property a \"Very Good\" is housekeeping.  They took a shortcut when cleaning the room. When I woke up after the first night, I noticed that the duvet cover had lipstick on it.  So I placed the card on the bed to indicate that I wanted my bed linen replaced.  Later that evening upon returning to the room, I discovered that the lipstick stain was still on the duvet. I called the front desk and got it aken care of.  But it bothered me that if it weren't for the stain, I wouldn't have known that", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Jackie S, Manager at DoubleTree by Hilton Savannah Historic District, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for your comments.
