Many of my friends prefer Steeltown over a well-known coffee spot. Personally, I am a tea drinker. I appreciate that the person behind the counter can explain to me the differences in all the teas being offered and help me make a good choice.  I have never been steered wrong.  I have been here many times for their Afternoon Teas held in the Christmas season. I highly recommend these teas  to anyone who wants to make their holiday season special. The manner of service is impeccable. The tea sandwiches and delicacies and scones are to die for!  The variety of hot teas offered is amazing.  I love trying new ones!  The art on the walls features local artists and is constantly changing. It is worth a visit just to see what is on display. There are games available to play while enjoying a lazy afternoon. I recently spent an evening there playing dominoes. There are hook ups to plug in your computer while enjoying your coffee. The cafe shares space with a local bank branch. Do not be put off by this unique situation.  You do not even notice it once you walk in the door.  There is a parking lot in the rear along with on-street parking.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-23T16:41:00-0400", "location_id": "4951559", "id": "357992938", "user": {"username": "Cherie P", "user_location": {"name": "Pittsburg, California", "id": "32895"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "At last, a coffee lover's haven.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32895-d4951559-r299508715-m11068-Steeltown_Coffee_Tea-Pittsburg_California.html#review299508715", "text": "At last, a coffee lover's haven.

On warm Spring days we sit outdoors and sip our beverages while watching Old Town pass-by; waving to neighbors and wishing good-days to those that catch our eye.  Summers are cool indoors and there is always a bit of gossip in the air. As a foil to the soaring temperatures you'll find a constellation of cool coffee drinks, as well as flavored iced beverages. Fall is the perfect time of year to visit Steeltown Coffee & Tea. Firstly, October is their anniversary and there is always a great party that owner, and bon vivant, Adrien Badger hosts. Secondly, the scent of warm pastries, toast & jams, and warm pumpkin lattes fill the air with reminiscences of visits to grand-mother's cozy home, where red and orange leaves float onto the lawn as grand-father mutters how it's time to rake the yard.\n\nSteeltown is not your average coffeehouse... it's an experience.
