I have popped in here every time I visit to get my fix. The original owner got into some legal trouble and the place was closed for a while much to my disappointment and on another trip we found them closed due to construction issues.Anyway I was back in town and they were open, I read a few reviews and almost tried another spot because they were so negative.So I showed up for lunch about 11:30 on a Friday, I was greeted by three employee's and I was the only customer in the place. It was clear there had been some changes in decor and staff, but I ordered my favorite lunch special Mandarin Chicken with white meat and it was excellent as well as the shrimp fried rice and egg roll. I was very pleased.I was a little sad that throughout my visit not another person entered the restaurant, clearly this place has lost it's mojo but on my visit everything was excellent,including service, lets hope they return to the days I remember in my youth !!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-13T08:13:09-0400", "location_id": "1203923", "id": "418051158", "user": {"username": "Marsh h", "user_location": {"name": "Ridgecrest, California", "id": "32966"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Finally back open after 7 months of being closed!!!

Tables were just kind of placed here and there in no particular order. I am not sure if they are still waiting for deliverys like table clothes for the tables or new tables etc... I suppose soon they will have it all organized. They need to build them some shelving so they can organize things. The dining area should not be cluttered with items setting on tables in the corners, such as plates and utensils and news papers. All of this stuff should be placed out of the dining area. Since they just opened back up, I suppose they were just in a hurry to get the doors back open and up and running for business. No pictures on the walls yet either.  New paint and new ceiling. All new kitchen equipment etc... The food is excellent and you get large portions for your money. We have been eating at Fongs for 35 years and no other chinese place can hold a candle to the food at Fongs. The Won-Ton Soup is awesome!!!!
