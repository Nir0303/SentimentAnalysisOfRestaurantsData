If you come to Vero, make sure it's the latter. My wife made reservations for 7:30 pm on a Friday. We arrived 10 minutes early and realized no reservations were needed. \n\nFirst thing I have to say is the staff was very friendly and chipper. Makayla - our server checked in on us just enough. After we ordered drinks, she came back to let me know my wine selection was no longer available. She suggested another and it was very good. When it comes to dinner the menu is limited, which is nice if you don't want to spend a ton of time trying to make a decision.  However it becomes problematic if three of the entrees are not available.   We split the crab cake appetizer, which was good. We both ordered the ginger salmon - very flavorful, presented well and a very generous portion.  If you are a chocolate lover, then the rum cake is for you. \n\nNow to the speed of things. It reminded me of some of the all inclusive resorts we have been to in the past...there is definitely time between the drinks arriving, appetizer, entree and dessert. If you enjoy a leisurely meals with time to spend with your significant other, you will enjoy Vero. If you are someone checking Facebook during your meal - you will probably come away disappointed. Our experience lasted just over two hours. \n\nWill we go back - probably. I just hope that they have all of the entree selections next time - they sound pretty good.

The restaurant was almost vacant with only two other customers seated as we arrived. We were greeted by the manager who was surprised we had made reservations. Our waiter came and asked for drinks which we ordered.  He came back after a wait and offered the daily specials while explaining that two of the items on a very limited menu were currently not available. Two of the items were one of the entrees that my wife had wanted. So we went back over the menu and specials and decided on other choices. They offered either soup or salad and when I asked about the salad dressings we were told that they only offered one choice. After a quite long wait we received our salads with no bread offering. I asked for some pepper as there was no salt or pepper on the table. They brought me a pepper grinder but it was empty and no offer to grind it for me. I sent the pepper grinder back asking for one with pepper. The salad was OK but with no other choices I thought it was average. Said to have walnuts although I did not get any. After a 15 minute wait after the salad I received my steak special which I ordered medium rare and came well done. I called the busboy  who at this point was doing all the serving, ( I had not seen my waiter for 20 minutes and another server came over and stated that the steak was well done and would order me another. My wife's entr\u00e9e was there and she was almost done before I received my steak. (Medium rare+ 6 8 minutes). The steak came back fine. I did have to ask for salt which was also not on the table. I asked if they had any bread which they sent three pieces with about a table spoon of butter. I asked for more butter for my potatoes and they brought anther table spoon in a very cute little tray that is small. We ordered crab cake appetizer's which came as three with a dark color and in my opinion no crab. A little greasy and heavy breading. (Not cheap). In our 2 hour meal I saw my waiter twice although he was seated at the bar area. This is not a cheap place where you expect this kind of SERVICE or entree's. Two other couples came in during our experience and the couple next to us ordered only appetizer's after viewing the menu. It is a beautiful place and could be a nice romantic venue if they would update the menu and food and mostly the service. I would not likely return.
