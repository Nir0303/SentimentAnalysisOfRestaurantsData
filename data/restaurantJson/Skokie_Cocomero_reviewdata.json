You will pay 49 cents an ounce.\nThis is a chain and they carry the regular Cocomero flavours, but they make their own pineapple flavour on site -- and it is fabulous!  Typing about it makes me want to jump into the car and get some....maybe mixed with Original Tart. \n\nOh, wait....let me finish the review first.\n\nThe only flaw in an otherwise wonderful experience is that there are no sample cups.  If you ask, you will get one.  Yes, one.  This is not a problem for me, because I could live on Cocomero Pineapple and Original Tart -- but most customers, I believe, are accustomed to \"try before you buy\" at yogurt stores.\n\nI saved the best for last.  They sell (summer only) the elaborate Korean dessert, patbingsu.  This is a layered snack with shaved ice, chewy mochi, sweetened condensed milk, various fresh fruits, red azuki beans, and topped with the yogurt of your choice.  It sells for $6,46 (as of 5/31/16)\n\nfree street parking.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-31T15:39:16-0400", "location_id": "9881057", "id": "378445554", "user": {"username": "illinois travelere", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
