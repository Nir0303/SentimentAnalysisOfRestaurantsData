Unfortunately it does not live up to its promise.  Went for brunch the first time, and was satisfied with what we got.  Went back for dinner since the menu looked so good.  Unfortunately, the food did not live up to its promise.  Greasy, overspiced, and generally disappointing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-07-09T07:00:57-0400", "location_id": "3786353", "id": "287238298", "user": {"username": "Ben Z", "user_location": {"name": "Marietta", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Not The Place for Dinner Meeting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35244-d3786353-r264452496-m11068-Hudson_Grille-Sandy_Springs_Georgia.html#review264452496", "text": "I went to a dinner meeting last night sponsored by a drug company for patients and family of those with Multiple Sclerosis.  This was NOT a place that such a dinner should be.\n\nWhile it started off nice with someone taking our drink orders, the room of @100 people was left with one server!  It took nearly an hour to get everyone served their salad.  Then people were served by what they ordered leaving at our table, one person with food and two waiting endlessly.\n\nWhen someone dropped a utensil on the floor, as people with MS have a tendency to do, I watched the wait staff see in, and step over it twice.  THIS multiple sclerosis patient got up and picked it up to prevent any body from accidentally tripping and getting hurt.  NO EXCUSE!\n\nFood, we had four choices: salmon, steak and shrimp, BBQ ribs and Chicken.  The steak was fatty and small, chicken was over cooked and dry, only the ribs was enjoyable by someone at our table.  Since there was only one server, it took 40 minutes by the time someone at our table got the soda they asked for.\n\nThis restaurant got the opportunity to have repeat business, but blew it.  They were only interested in profit, but did not provide adequate staff (wait staff and chef) to accommodate this dinner.

They serve drinks AND food late.  It is a classic sports bar done well and done HUGE!  All kinds of pool tables, shuffle board, ping pong etc and tons of good quality tvs.  Believe it or not the food was actually way better than expected too.  The highlight though was my bartender. Roxy was her name.  She was friendly, attentive, helpful and cute.  Very cute.  That always helps.\n\nIn summary you can go here late, east well, play games and drink with a cute girl.  What more can you ask for?
