My Mom and I started with the crab soup, which was very good, then she and I had salads while my daughter had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. The salads were nice and fresh -- my Mom had the Asian salad, I had the one that came with steak and warm bacon dressing (don't remember the name of it). I couldn't tell my dressing was warm and it honestly didn't taste very bacon-y to me. I tried to order extra dressing with it when our server took our order, because I always find I need just a little more than they put on it, but she discouraged me, saying it already had a lot on it. She said if I didn't think it was enough, she'd be happy to bring me more, but by the time I started eating it, I didn't want to wait for more dressing or feel like a glutton because she'd already said it was plenty. So, I ended up taking some of my Mom's extra Asian dressing, which I thought was a lot better than my bacon dressing, and adding it to my salad. So, my lunch missed the mark by that much. My daughter said her sandwich was really good, but she didn't seem too excited when she said it. \n\nThe atmosphere is a little stuffy for me and one in which I felt I should talk quietly and \"act like a lady,\" which is still hard for me to do at 52. So, I don't think I would feel comfortable bringing little kids here (at least not mine when they were small). There is a small patio area where you can eat outside, which might be more casual if you need/like that, but it's right on the sidewalk without much room to feel like you're not eating in street traffic to me. \n\nThis place is a bit on the pricey side, which I only mention because I'm not sure the food is actually worth the price. I realize they are trying to appeal to a more selected clientele (ladies' lunches, business men, etc.) but I think the price of the food overshoots its quality just a bit. \n\nThe restaurant serves lunch, dinner, and brunch, so we got menus to take with us. They also deliver within their area, which would be nice to try if we lived closer. There were a lot of things that looked enticing on their menu and I believe the food is good enough to come back and try something different another time and even at another service...just not so good that I'm willing to pay to do it often.

We went on recommendations given on Trip Advisor.  The restaurant has a nice decorative appeal and good food.  We had called in a reservation, and the nice and pleasant young lady gave us a window seat on the bar side.  We ordered the filets, and they had an excellent taste.  The steaks looked a little small when they arrived, especially for the price, however, they were very thick.  We enjoyed our salads, bread and butter, and vegetables, as well.  The salads do not come with the meal.  We should've asked about substitutions, but on the menu it noted a salad could be added to the entree for $2, and that's what we did.  There were a couple of things that could have made this very good 4 star restaurant into an excellent 5 star for us.  The biggest thing was our server.  We had everything we needed, but there was still a lack of personal attention.  I think a lot of the customers were locals that she knew, and it wasn't a big deal, but it wasn't 5 star service.  Also, forgive me for being picky, but the small tomatoes in the salad had shriveled peel, the au gratin potatoes were a little dry, and it would've been nice if the windows weren't quite so dirty when being fortunate enough to be given a window seat.  Thanks again to the young hostess for doing that for us.  All in all, it is a great little restaurant in the downtown/historic section of Concord.
