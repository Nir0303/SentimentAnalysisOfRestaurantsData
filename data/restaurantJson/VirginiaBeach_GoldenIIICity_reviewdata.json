We were all a bit tired from our 8 hour drive from PA. We have often heard that Chinese food just isn't as good the farther away you get from NYC and Philly. I couldn't disagree more. For being a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant the food actually was very good. We ordered numerous items from the menu as we always do. The teriyaki chicken was amazing. Bourbon chicken was excellent. The fried rice was moist and flavorful. The crab rangoons were better than ones I've had in the city. The general Tso chicken was rather generic, buffet quality. The seafood soup was more like vegetable soup broth with shrimp and crab added. The meal was very satisfying. We had no regrets. This is not a place I would want to dine at however. The place is very run down. The dining area was filthy. The owners kids were running around playing. The owner seemed to be very angry at something. But hey, for take out the price was very fair and worth it.
