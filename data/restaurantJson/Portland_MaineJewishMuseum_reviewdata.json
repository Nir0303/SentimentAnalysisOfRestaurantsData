In the heart of downtown Portland, with other significant historical churches for neighbors of Italian, Irish, African, and Episcopalian origins, you get a fascinating chance to feel the past in the present.  There are permanent storyboards depicting Jewish Lives of Maine for more than a century, rotating art exhibitions, a plethora of cultural programs scheduled throughout the year, docent led tours as well as self guided tour handouts.  When we entered the building, there were all sorts of people working and volunteering and everyone of those people was smiling.  We hit the jackpot as we actually met and talked to the Rabbi and the Art Curator there, as well as a library archivist and the office manager.   They could not have been more friendly, more enthusiastic or more knowledgeable....and we left the building smiling too.
