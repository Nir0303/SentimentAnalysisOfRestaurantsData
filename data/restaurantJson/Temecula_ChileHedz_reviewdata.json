My brother loves hot sauce so we stopped in to see what they had. They let you sample everything which is fun and helps you decide what to get as their selection is huge and very different. A great place to get gifts, stocking stuffers for the heat loving person, and one of the better novelty spots in Old Town. \n\nThe service was great too.
