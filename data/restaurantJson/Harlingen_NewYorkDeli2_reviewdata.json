We enjoyed this Beatles-themed restaurant so much, we went a second day.  And the week isn't over yet!\n\nI have to say that although their reuben sandwich was decent, it was far from the best I've had.  But for this part of Texas, it probably deserves the high ratings that other reviewers have given it.   Their kingston and manhattan sandwiches and Sergeant Pepper burger more than made up for it.  They were gourmet.  The meals came with a nice dill pickle, a carrot sliver, and a side dish.  We had fries, cole slaw, and potato salad and all were good.  Of the four dishes we ordered, the burger and kingston sandwich were the best.\n\nThe wait staff were very good and helpful with suggestions and customer favorites.  Service was fast too, both days.  On day two, the place was full and we had our meal delivered in about 8 minutes.   Prices were good too at less than $10 each.  We didn't order desert but the carrot and chocolate cakes, half moon cookies, and other items looked fresh.\n\nIf this restaurant was located in an east coast city, I'd have given it a 4 rating.  But this is by far the best sandwich place we've eaten in our month of Gulf coast travel, so I rated it as 5.\n\nI hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did.  \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-07T12:04:33-0500", "location_id": "4809272", "id": "325115263", "user": {"username": "jazzie F", "user_location": {"name": "Canandaigua", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Person ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55960-d4809272-r322625599-m11068-New_York_Deli_2-Harlingen_Texas.html#review322625599", "text": "Small older building service slow food great big sandwich hard to get to back room a great place for take out", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-28T06:35:57-0400", "location_id": "4809272", "id": "322625599", "user": {"username": "Lesta T", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
