I grew up in Peru eating lots of ceviche and this was definitely undercooked, chemically. The ceviche, although technically raw, is not supposed to taste raw after it marinates in lime juice for a few hours.\n\nI'll give the benefit of the doubt to the restaurant and chalk it up to me coming in around 11:30 a.m. for lunch and they probably not really having the ceviche fully ready. If that was the case, though, they should not have served it to me.\n\nPeruvian food is some of the most delicious in the world and I'd hate for an experience like this to unfairly taint a \"newbie's\" view of Peruvian food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-31T09:38:29-0400", "location_id": "1116036", "id": "413193714", "user": {"username": "TCubillas", "user_location": {"name": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "id": "53449"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "buena comida y buenos precios", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46718-d1116036-r19766641-m11068-Estrellita_Del_Sur-Paterson_New_Jersey.html#review19766641", "text": "buena comida y buenos precios", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-08-22T22:02:42-0400", "location_id": "1116036", "id": "19766641", "user": {"username": null, "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Riqu\u00edsima la comida", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46718-d1116036-r376329363-m11068-Estrellita_Del_Sur-Paterson_New_Jersey.html#review376329363", "text": "Cada vez que voy es pedirme una jalea o un bisteck a lo pobre, la comida es buen\u00edsima y sobre todo de buena proporci\u00f3n, atenci\u00f3n excelente y sobre todo es un rinconcito de nuestro Peru maravilloso :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-25T00:17:11-0400", "location_id": "1116036", "id": "376329363", "user": {"username": "silvana14sm", "user_location": {"name": "Mollendo, Peru", "id": "1584773"}}}]}
