It's not just excellent community theater; it is often excellent theater. Period. The actors come from Merced, Fresno, Modesto, and occasionally farther afield; some are professional and most are experienced, but the productions with large casts might have a few newcomers from high school and JC theater departments. They do a lot with a small space.\n\nBefore each show and during intermission, patrons can buy snacks, sodas, beer, and wine in the lobby area, and you CAN bring your purchases into the theater. (Thank you, Playhouse Merced.) The theater itself is small - maybe 300 stadium-style seats? - so most seats have a very good view. I recommend sitting anywhere in Section 2, followed by Section 1. Sit in Section 3 only if the other sections are sold out. You can select your seats when you buy your tickets online, on the phone, or in person. If you are a K-12 or university student with a current ID, you can get your ticket for half price - $10-12, I believe, depending on the section, but student tickets have to be purchased in person so they can check your ID. It's worth it. Go. The season runs roughly late August to early June, and they sometimes offer Sunday night game shows (Merced Feud and Drama Island) between shows. (Sorry, no photos of plays here - just two game show nights.)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-28T18:44:22-0400", "location_id": "5960748", "id": "387261636", "user": {"username": "BB-from-SB", "user_location": {"name": "Merced, California", "id": "32706"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Playhouse Merced!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32706-d5960748-r386127334-m11068-Playhouse_Merced-Merced_California.html#review386127334", "text": "Always have a wonderful time here!!
