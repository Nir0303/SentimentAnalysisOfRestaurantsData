It is one of only three historic churches left downtown.  They gave us a personalized tour of the sanctuary with all of its beautiful stained glass windows and historic structure.  They took us to the smaller chapel which has even more detailed and beautiful stained glass windows.  They sent us something in the mail as a momento of our visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-29T12:07:38-0500", "location_id": "558999", "id": "329794485", "user": {"username": "Steven E", "user_location": {"name": "Deer Creek, Illinois", "id": "35884"}}}]}
