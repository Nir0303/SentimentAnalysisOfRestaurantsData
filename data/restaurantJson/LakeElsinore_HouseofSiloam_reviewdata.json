First let me say I did not get to stay at this business.  Why?  Because I called 2 times to get further information and possibly to make reservations for my family, and both times got hung up on.  Why you ask, well because I speak English.  I was blown away that I call a business in America and then hung up on because the person answering does not speak English.  I called twice and both times a female answering said, \" I dont speak English\" and then instead of trying to help me hangs the phone up on me. REALLY!  I am so pissed that I was treated like this that I wanted to advise others, I mean if you only speak English how do you make a reservation?!  So do not give these people your money they do not deserve to be in business for the terrible customer service.

I have been to quite a few hot springs and the sulfur hot springs water at the House of Siloam is the best quality I have ever experienced.\n\nAll the rooms have hot sulfur mineral water directly piped into each room so you can cook in the kitchen with the sulfur hot springs water or take a long soak in the Japanese style bathtub filled with hot sulfur mineral water.  The effects of the sulfur hot spring water are amazing.\n\nThe rooms are not very luxurious but that is understandable because their room rates are very competitive for what you get. This is not like your high-priced high-end spa. It is a simple quiet relaxing place for you to get away from your busy lifestyle. \n\nThe owners, who are Korean and Japanese, are very friendly and respectful.  I would recommend House of Siloam if you are a connoisseur of sulfur hot spring water and into natural healing and relaxation.", "helpful_votes": "8", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2010-03-21T20:15:00-0400", "location_id": "1015567", "id": "59187034", "user": {"username": "Gongji", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2009-01", "title": "Delightful place to Visit", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32595-d1015567-r27892403-m11068-House_of_Siloam-Lake_Elsinore_California.html#review27892403", "text": "This is a delightful place to visit.

The last time, they also had a massage therapist who is trained in many different techniques. Great place to get away from the complications of life.  The rooms are large suites. Some have kitchens, other can accommodate up to 6 people. Each room has a bath tub connected directly to the spa water. Some have special large tubs. There are also spa jacuzzi outside for all, a sauna and warm pool with both spa and regular water mixed together. There are also some fun free games(air hockey, foosball, baskeball, etc.)  for the kids. Great place to get away to take the family.

For a $20 upgrade, you can get a bathroom with a large tub where you can be submerged into chest-deep water.  They are located on a natural hot spring, so the hot spring water is piped into the plumbing.  They also have various \"spa\" amenities such as an outdoor pool (naturally heated from the hot springs) outdoor jacuzzi, indoor jacuzzi, and sauna.  They also have BBQ grills, air hockey, and ping pong tables for the kids.
