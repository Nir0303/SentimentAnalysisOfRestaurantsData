The Pizza was the thinest crust anywhere we have seen in the Sacramento/Roseville area. The kitchen is willing to create anything you might want in choice of pizza. The Large salad is big enough for two to share. The small pizza worked for us. We had the bruschetta pizza for the vegans in the group and ordered a combination for the meat eaters.  We had a special pizza made with blue cheese, chicken, pepperoni, black olives with a creamy garlic sauce that prompted taking advantage of the $3.00 pints of Shock Top and Sierra Nevada; a Thursday special item along with small pizzas at $8.00 each. A great 2+ hours of talk, eat and enjoy. It can be cold and noisy if the trains are running outside, but we didn't have any problem talking over the noise of each other or the trains.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-03-10T08:48:31-0500", "location_id": "2601405", "id": "125898727", "user": {"username": "bw13802", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento CA Area", "id": null}}}]}
