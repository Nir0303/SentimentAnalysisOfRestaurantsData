Both Oak Farm & McCay are wonderful wineries with a solid reputation. Prie is a newer place with outstanding wines as well.\n\nB&H offers 24 rotating craft ber taps, the most in Lodi-Woodbridge. A good selection of different breweries from all over the west coast with an emphasis on Sacramento & the Bay Area. A few from OR, WA, and SoCal. They also had a lot of styles of beers: Pils, Ambers, IPA, DIPA, Porter, Stout, Wheat, etc.\n\nNo food service but they have partnered with Raley's to sell Deli Plates of fresh fruit, cheese, meat, crackers, etc. They looked really good.\n\nPrices are a bit higher than other spots in downtown Lodi but well worth it. No loud music, acoustics are good so noise does not bounce around the space, and it is upscale. Target demographics are definitely 35+ (read as: no drunk 20-somethings).\n\nOwners, a husband & wife team, were super friendly as was the waitress. Nice tables & stools, and tasteful wall decor. More wine bar than beer joint for sure.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-04T10:45:03-0400", "location_id": "10264520", "id": "370192193", "user": {"username": "RedZin", "user_location": {"name": "Lodi, California", "id": "32640"}}}]}
