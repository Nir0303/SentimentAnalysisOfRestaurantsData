Black Horse was full, and Cloud 9 was not open for lunch.  I found myself at Kooka's Nest on Strawberry Alley, which if your walking by, you may not see. Kooka's Nest and the little coffee shop next door are technically separate places, but also open to each other, which is nice. I walked in and found a mini cafe is the only way to describe it. Think Starbucks, but with more of a DIY/Artsy vibe. The couple behind the counter and grille were so nice and friendly! I got the Grilled Chicken Quesadillas and sweet tea. There are only 4-5 tables, and the prices are pretty comparable. They would probably be great for to go orders, but I am not exactly sure if they do that. Great food and this is a little hidden gem! Give it a try! Great atmosphere, friendly owners/staff, yes it is small, but they do know how to cook! Also a great option if you don't want the everything is fried option when the  River's and Spires festival is going on as well as, if you are on diet and/or have specific diet specifications.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-08-26T18:02:05-0400", "location_id": "4846499", "id": "303885426", "user": {"username": "VintagePhotoGirl", "user_location": {"name": "Clarksville, Tennessee", "id": "54955"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Tastebuds awakened.
