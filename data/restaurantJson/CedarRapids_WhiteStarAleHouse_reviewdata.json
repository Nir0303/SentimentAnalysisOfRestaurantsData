I think this was the worst food I had for a long time . Our food had no flavor at all . My daughter ask for her beef tenderloin med. And it rare no salt or seasoning at all ,the cheesy potatoes tasted out of a box. My season chicken sandwich didn't taste like anything. Appetizer very greasy. The best thing we had was the fries .", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-08T18:29:47-0400", "location_id": "2457664", "id": "403033968", "user": {"username": "Alyson C", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
