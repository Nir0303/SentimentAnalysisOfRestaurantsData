As we waited for our appetizers; we split 2 of them...the mozzarella wrapped in romaine and the cheesy bread....both were little bites of heaven, we enjoyed our bar drinks and watched food being delivered to other tables around us and our eyes were popping out of our heads. Everything looked amazing...so well presented. The time between courses was absolutely perfect. We never felt rushed. My husband had the tuna. I opted for the crab stuffed trout which was served over fried green tomatoes. There was SO much lump crab in there, it tasted like heaven. I opted to upgrade my side to the Quinoa Salad and that was delicious. My entr\u00e9e and salad were such a generous portion that I took almost half of it home. (It tasted great reheated!) We were so full, but the dessert selection sounded too good to walk away from, so the 4 of us split one...it was a pineapple upside down cake with cheesecake in the middle.

Often when one does not meet ones expectations it can cast a shadow on the remainder of the dining experience. Seating is a very personal choice. If by chance you are seated in a location that  is not to your liking, please let us know. If an alternative location is available we would gladly move you.  \n   The same goes with your food. You chose two of our most popular and highly rated items that our guests prefer. Our beef is all C.A.B. (Certified Angus Beef) the top 30% of all choice beef aged over 30 days for tenderness and flavor. Our Crab cakes are 95% Crabmeat with little filler. That being said, let us know that you did not prefer our preparation and we will find a suitable substitution for you. \n\n   We have over 40 selections and usually two daily feature. We would rather do several items well than do a multitude of items mediocre. \n\n   This is your review and I welcome your comments. I could understand if a restaurant has several negative comments on ones dining experience the need to decry a comment of hesitation of coming back.  But I need to let you know what that means to a business. A critique on food and service is very informative and welcome. Would be a tough world if we made up our mind on just one experience But encouraging someone not to return does several things, it removes the life blood required to keep a business and the 45 staff members alive. It could potential end in a vacancy of that business. If you care about that business let the manager or owner know of your concerns. The caring business will listen and look to accommodate. The lesser businesses will continue their ways. Imagine how you would like to be treated if you were in business, you seem like the type of person that would like know.\n\nBest wishes and hopeful you will return.\nJim Morasso\nOwner/ Webb Custom Kitchen\n", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-11-11T13:11:07-0500", "id": "436456559"}, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-11-09T08:39:07-0500", "location_id": "9731636", "id": "435886859", "user": {"username": "Kecia W", "user_location": {"name": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "id": "49022"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Even if you don't live near Gastonia, it's worth the drive.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49156-d9731636-r435216134-m11068-Webb_Custom_Kitchen-Gastonia_North_Carolina.html#review435216134", "text": "The restaurant is in the former, Webb Theater which opened in the 20's.

As we sat close to the bar on Monday the same hostess stood at the bar for probably 20 minutes talking to a customer.
