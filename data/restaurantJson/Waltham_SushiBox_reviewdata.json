The space is small, but much of the business is take-out so there isn't a problem with being seated.  Their sushi is awesome, as are the entrees;  noodle dishes such as \"yakisoba\" are loaded with vegetables rather than having the noodles overwhelm the plate as happens all too often elsewhere.  Everything I've tried there has been fresh and delicious.  If you eat at the compact sushi bar and other people are there, it's hard to not get drawn into amicable conversation, oftentimes with the manager joining in.   Yasu is a good choice for when you want superior Japanese cuisine at a reasonable price, and have time to savor and socialize.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2004-07-06T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "323156", "id": "2271639", "user": {"username": null, "user_location": {"name": "Cambridge, MA", "id": null}}}]}
