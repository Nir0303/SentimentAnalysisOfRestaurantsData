I pulled up their website and found it very interesting and we headed to find it.\n\nWe were warmly greeted, went to the counter to order after looking at the menu. I decided to have the pork barbecue plate which came with two sides. I chose smoked macaroni and cheese, coleslaw  and hush puppies and a roll. My friend ordered the brisket plate with the same sides.\n\nWe sat down and waited while it was prepared. There were five homemade sauces on the table to add to the BBQ. It is a true slowly smoked pork and brisket without sauce. The customer can add which ever they twant. I tried each and all were very good. The pork was delicious and the homemade yeast roll was tender and excellent. Now about those hush puppies , the best I have ever had anywhere. Believe me I have tasted many hush puppies over the years.\n\nWhen Barry who owns That Good BBQ, came to our table we had a nice conversation and learned a little about him and his background. I can say without a doubt he knows how to give his customers a great food experience. I will drive the 1 1/2 hours to have this BBQ again.
