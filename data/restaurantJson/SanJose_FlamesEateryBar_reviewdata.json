Having recently been to Las Vegas, I was tempted by the description of this place as having \"Las Vegas style ambience\" and the menu items look really delicious; I was also looking forward to the unlimited mimosas. Unfortunately it seemed to me that it had some of the bad aspects of Vegas and none of the good ones. As soon as I walked in I had second thoughts as the place was pretty crowded and loud. There was a waiting list and there were quite a few people waiting outside, some already with mimosas in hand. \nWhen we got seated, the seats and tables were a bit run-down. The menu's were dog-eared, dirty, stained and even painted on. We ordered the unlimited mimosas which at $11.50 are a great deal. But they are not very good mimosas. They tasted like cheap grocery store orange juice with just a little bit of champagne and they tasted more like carbonated o.j. We had one of their omelettes with the hashbrowns. The food was edible, but not particularly tasty. We also had their caramel-banana French toast. This is one item that we had been looking forward to since the previous day when we read the menu. But this too was a disappointment. It was not very flavorful and rather eggy. Aside from the fresh slices of banana, it was no different than what you get at IHOP. Their lattes are much too expensive for the little cup they serve.\nOur server was friendly and checked on us several times when we first started eating. Unfortunately at some point it seemed she must have decided it was time for us to go and stopped. When we were finally able to flag her down we asked her for a last refill of our mimosas. This was around 2:03 and she informed us that she could not because the unlimited mimosas stop at 2:00. I would have expected a good server to stop by and let us know of this and offer a refill. I would also think that considering that it was only a few minutes after 2 and that she had not checked on us for about 15 minutes, that she would have done it without question. The one positive I have for Flames is the price. My breakfast was almost $15 less than I usually pay for a similar breakfast. Needless to say it was not as enjoyable as my usual breakfast.\nWhile this was my first visit to San Jose, I think it makes for a nice quick getaway.
