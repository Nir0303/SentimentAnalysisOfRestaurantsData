Holy mackerel. I don't know what they're putting in their burgers or how they're cooking them? But they need to stop because they are so delicious. Normally, I'll eat half of a restaurant burger and take the rest home for the next day. Not here. Ate the whole thing. Wish my wife hadn't finished hers. :-(\n\nMy burger was the \"meat candy\" model, with bacon and some delicious cheese. They crumble their bacon on these burgers so every bite gets some bacon in it. Brilliant!\n\nAlso, I was impressed with their fries. Thin-ish shoestring numbers, but they sprinkle crack on them that made me eat every one, lick my fingers, and was tempted to lick the basket lining but again, my wife held me back. Such a kill joy.\n\nService was great.

If your visiting NWA for business (Walmart?) or pleasure, take the short 5 mile drive to downtown Rogers and try this place. You won't be disappointed.
