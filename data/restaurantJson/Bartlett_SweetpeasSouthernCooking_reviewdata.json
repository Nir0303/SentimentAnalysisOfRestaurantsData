The service provided on both visits was super, even though on one trip the place was packed .They have music on Saturday night by an Elvis Impersonator, who also does a variety of music. I will surely return regularly to try more of that awesome food ! This is some of the best home style cooked food in the Memphis area.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-17T08:57:57-0400", "location_id": "3930120", "id": "260092795", "user": {"username": "Jim T", "user_location": {"name": "Bartlett", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Home cookin", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54885-d3930120-r251853408-m11068-Sweetpea_s_Southern_Cooking-Bartlett_Tennessee.html#review251853408", "text": "This Virginia girl loved the sweet potato casserole.

So far we've twice tried their daily lunch specials and they were delicious!  The Country Fried Steak is very good; the Fried Chicken Livers are great.  Their cornbread is to-die-for:  true southern, from white corn meal, moist and dense and not sweet!!  Their Cole Slaw is very much to my liking--not too sweet and not too sour.  They have a very large selection of sides and a very friendly staff.  Ask for a senior discount, or a very generous discount for in-uniform military or law enforcement.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-06T17:51:46-0500", "location_id": "3930120", "id": "247939115", "user": {"username": "homeiswhereweparkit", "user_location": {"name": "Drummonds, Tennessee", "id": null}}}]}
