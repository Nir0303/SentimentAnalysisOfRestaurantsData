The staff was super friendly and welcoming and greeted regulars by name.  The menu was diverse with a little bit of everything, but a definite focus on Italian fare. I had a small personal sized pizza which I learned has homemade crust and sauce. I went simple with ham only and it was divine.  My husband had a gyro which he enjoyed thoroughly.  They do deliver within a 20 block radius and they are open and serving food until 3:00 a.m. It's a must try regardless of time, but for sure if you are starving after 10pm when everything else is closed, you will find your culinary heroes ready to serve you something delicious.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-05T09:44:00-0400", "location_id": "10515826", "id": "389449614", "user": {"username": "Celia B", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
