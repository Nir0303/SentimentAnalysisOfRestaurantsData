We left at 6:30PM and on the way over, I imagined that the place would be jam-packed, being that it's supper time.  \n\nWhen we arrived, the place looked empty and initially, I thought they might be closed.  Because the interior of the restaurant \u201chas soft lighting\u201d it appeared dark from the street.  I then noticed there was another family and a couple dining inside.  \n\nDoesn't anyone eat supper anymore?  Unlike the 70s and 80s, when I was growing up, supper was customarily around 5-7PM, but I guess with today\u2019s uncertain economy working families eat at different times in order to accommodate their busy schedules.  \n\nUpon entering, we were received right away and seated at a corner table.  The inside of this restaurant always reminds me of Hawaii, because the interior d\u00e9cor has that Polynesian appearance.  \n\nIt didn't take us more than a couple of minutes to decide on what we wanted to order, however it took about 15 minutes before anyone responded to our table.  I assumed that since there were only a total of three families and three servers, the service would be a little faster. \n\nWhen our server did finally respond, she was welcoming and took our order but when I asked her what type of \u201csoup\u201d she could recommend, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m new here.\u201d  So I guess soup was out!  \u201cI\u2019m thinking, maybe you should know these things because customers will usually go by what they recommend\u2026 or in this case, not.\u201d\n\nWe ordered the crispy Eggrolls as an appetizer for starters, along with Prawn Pad Thai, Prawn Fried Rice, Chicken Curry, and another Chicken Appetizer.  \u201cCan you tell, we like chicken and prawns?\u201d\n\nThe crispy egg rolls came first and as advertised, they were crispy, well cooked and pretty good.  The Eggrolls came with a fish dipping sauce or at least that's what it tasted like but milder.  The sauce really complimented the Eggrolls and gave it a little tangy sweet flavor.  It didn't take long to finish the plate.  \n\nNext came the Chicken Curry followed by the Prawn Fried Rice.  I thought the curry came out a little thin on the consomm\u00e9 side, but there was no objections in the flavor. \n\nThe Prawn Fried Rice was delightful but then again, I've always been partial to fried rice.  The next dish was the Prawn Pad Thai, which was another wonderful dish and went well with the fried rice.  Our server was more attentive, replenishing our glasses with water and we enjoyed the rest of our meal. \n\nUpon completing our supper, I waited for ten minute before I gestured for our waitress for the check.  By this time, there wasn\u2019t anyone else in the restaurant other than one person who came in for take-out.  \n\nOur waitress looked over at our table then continued to carry on a conversation with her co-worker.  \u201cI guess I\u2019m just the intolerant type.\u201d\n\nOur bill came out to $43.00 and some change and the overall dining experience here for the third time in as many years was very enjoyable.  Everyone one of the dishes were prepared well and no one conveyed any criticisms.  \n\nWe will continue to dine at this delightful restaurant notwithstanding the slow service.  The waitress, although acknowledging that she was new to the restaurant, instead of carrying on a conversation with her co-worker, she should have taken the time and studied the menu or asked the cook what types of \u201csoup\u201d they carried and what was recommended!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-07-12T15:41:59-0400", "location_id": "2467201", "id": "215063476", "user": {"username": "Holdtheair", "user_location": {"name": "Tracy, California", "id": "33184"}}}]}
