The tacos were sensational and the pickled slaw on it was to die for.  The meat and cheese plate was also delicious and went well with the beers.  \nThe service was slow and inconsistent but there was only one girl working the floor so I felt kind of badly for her.

The place had a certain charm in its day, but was old, dirty and tired.  I returned this week to have a drink and sandwich at the new, \"Ordinary\", and was thoroughly impressed.  They have completely renovated this restaurant top to bottom and restored it to what it probably looked like years ago, hand cleaning and repairing the intricate carved wooden panelling and elegant trim work with dental equipment.  The place looks gorgeous and the food was phenomenal.  I recommend the pork sandwich or the brisket which comes with their fantastic barbecue sauce and is smoked locally at their barbecue restaurant in Hamden, \"Smokebox Barbecue\".  No frills on the food presentation at the bar, just a great sandwich in a paper dish, but it didn't need presentation, the food was excellent.  Great service at the bar and nice atmosphere with the gothic looking chandelier lighting and old carved paneling.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-23T06:35:19-0400", "location_id": "4079252", "id": "223824719", "user": {"username": "Jon B", "user_location": {"name": "Connecticut, United States", "id": null}}}]}
