Once again, I let nostalgia derail my expectations.  Hokkaido is the origin of robatayaki style awesomeness and I was hoping to get just a sliver of that experience:  Intimate (if somewhat smoky) setting, reasonably affordable, chicken-parts-on-a-stick goodness, washed down with mugs of cold beer.\n\nThis experience was:  hip, dark & weirdly spot lit, LOUD, too expensive for the style of food, with the grill shunned off into a corner, and service was herky-jerky. (Also my mother would slap me if she found out that I paid $15 for okonomiyaki - cuz that, like yakisoba, is one of those foods you make at home when you are scraping the bottom of the pantry/fridge - or it's a cheap (good) street snack- but not $15, yo!)   We had no reservations, but were promptly seated at the bar when we went around 5.  It got very busy and very loud no time at all.\n\nWe ordered the corn fritters, maitake mushrooms, bonjiri (chicken butt!) and ramen.  The \"appetizers\" came out first, but spaced 20 minutes between each dish.  Fritters were good. The grilled maitake was just crispy mushroom on sticks- no seasoning, no oil, nothing. Bonjiri was really good, but so small - baby chicken butts.  \n\nAnd the ramen ...totally bougie, \"haole\" style.  It came out at least 20 mins after the last appetizer was taken away.  Dark, molasses dark broth, which was actually pretty tasty.  But they went and put fresh sliced cabbage and sesame seeds in it (Like dumping odd katsu-bento garnish items into the bowl. That's weird!) The green onion was chunky sliced, so it wouldn't come up with the noodles as you ate it. People hopping on this ramen trend don't understand, it's not just a bowl of brown broth, with noodles and random stuff thrown in there.  (Dude, that's Top Ramen, not \"ramen-ramen\"). It was good for a bowl of noodles, just wasn't ramen. \n\nWe waited an oddly long amount of time before we finally flagged the bartender for the check.\n\nThe soft-serve at the window was FANTASTIC!  Miso caramel with whiskey butterscotch sauce was the best dessert I've had in a long time.  I'll pop by the soft-serve window just for that, but I'll skip the main fare -  and hibachi that stuff on my own at home.

We've read about this restaurant in the newspaper and on line.  When in Napa a couple of weeks ago, we decided to give it a try.  Walking distance from our hotel, which is always a good thing.  Overall the food was OK and service was average - only a couple of complaints, but the bill was $94.50 for the two of us.  Beer and sake prices are on the high end.  For example, we had a 8 or 9 oz pour of Junmal - it was $19.00.  Could buy the whole bottle in the grocery store for about $22 - $29. We mostly ate meat on a stick, tried 5.  Prices ranged from $7-$8.50 for two sticks.  We normally pay between $3 and $4 for the same quality/quantity.  The chicken hearts were ill prepared, the hard part on the top was not trimmed off and that part was inedible.  Chef tried to tell us that was the way they were prepared in Japan. The real clincher though was the Albacore for $11.  4 pieces, sliced so thin they were somewhat transparent and each piece was about a 1 inch square.  On top of that they wanted to charge you about $5.00 for fresh grated wasabi.  So when in Napa, if I want Japanese, I would go back to Morimoto.

I\u2019ve followed the star evolution of chef Curtis DiFede from Oliveto to Oenotri and now to his newest innovation, the Japanese inspired Miminashi.  Here he incorporates traditional Japanese elements with a vibrant flair for authenticity with a fresh twist. Unless you can read Japanese, you need to know the address of this Izakaya inspired pub as the name is scrolled in small Japanese characters only with the number 821 below (as in 821 Coombs Street, Napa, California). The beautifully handmade carved doors are a nod to Mt. Fuji while the modern, hip, yet casual d\u00e9cor includes booths and tables to accommodate various numbers of diners. The staff was welcoming and sat our group of four immediately. Warm clothes to wash our hands were delivered on handsome wood pads, a much-appreciated surprise after a day of Napa Valley festivities. When we asked, we were brought water, both sparkling and still. The sommelier has an excellent knowledge of sakes, wines, and beers and was happy to recommend a beverage that would compliment our food. The menu changes according to what\u2019s fresh on the farm and fisheries. On our evening we shared many dishes including the beef tataki sashimi, stone tree farm beets, Matthiasson farm peaches, and house-made gyoza from the sashimi, vegetable, and noodle column.  The beets and peaches were colorful standouts. Under Yakitori, we were adventuresome and ordered Tan-Moto, beef tongue, Moo-shoniku (chicken thigh) Shishito peppers, and the fabulous Maitake mushrooms, which have an interesting back-story. We also shared main course of Yellowfin tuna.  Without exception, everything was truly delicious with unique and individualized tastes. All plates are portioned for sharing with chopsticks (you can ask for silverware), and it\u2019s a fun way to experience these very different flavors of Japan.  We finished our meal with their coconut soft cream in a waffle bowl.  The dessert specials for the night included a peach crumble and a mango freeze, both sounded delicious, but we settled on the signature ice cream. Guests can sit at the bar or at the counter to watch the cooks work over the wood fire. Walkser on the street can watch through the window as the person makes the soft cream. Be aware that the noise level is high in Miminashi and reservations are \u201ca must\u201d. (The place was packed at 5:30pm.) Arigato, Curtis, for designing a novel eatery that is original and inventive. Looking forward to the next meal to see what\u2019s new on the menu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-06T19:38:56-0400", "location_id": "10306299", "id": "389942961", "user": {"username": "StarLady99", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Headache inducing noise level ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d10306299-r387828195-m11068-Miminashi-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html#review387828195", "text": "The waitress couldn't hear us, we couldn't hear each other and between 7 and 8pm there were more decibels than the Indianapolis 500.

Wow, what a culinary delight! We were blown away by one great dish after another (3 of us, so sampled many dishes). Very intelligent and high quality wine list. I'm not a salad person, and I fell in love with their gem salad with a couple of veggies and a miso vinagerette (sounds plain, but remember, I'm not a salad guy and I'd go back just for this). 17 or 18 yakitori (meat on a skewer) are offered, these are luscious and safe if you're not sure about Japanese food. Waiters and staff are very patient and knowledgable, answer questions about the menu without making you feel like the only dummy in the room. Then, the soft serve ice cream in a waffle bowl at the end will get you to eat beyond your capacity. I absolutely CAN'T WAIT to go back and eat my way through the menu. If you're in a hurry, their bar seats 15-20 people and was busy all night. Clearly a hit with locals.
