Picasso for Sunday Brunch with 3 other adults and 1 child (who didn\u2019t order food, so for all intents and purposes we were a four-top).  My wife and I are local and had been here at least 4 other times, including once for brunch. Our previous experiences here were positive. This visit, however, was so negative\u2014and made worse by comments one of our party overheard the staff make about our table\u2014that we will never be back. Here\u2019s what happened:\n \nWe showed up at approximately 10:50 am.  There were a handful (maybe 5?) of occupied tables outside and maybe 3-4 occupied tables inside when we were seated.  It took approximately five minutes for our server to initially greet our table after we were seated.  We ordered drinks (coffee and water, apple juice for the child) and doughnuts before deciding on our main course.  The drinks came out in reasonable time and we then placed our entr\u00e9e order (4 entrees, straight from the menu, no substitutions).  The doughnuts also came out in reasonable time and looked delicious, but upon cutting into them we discovered that they had not been sufficiently cooked through; much of the interior dough was raw and inedible.  We did our best to eat around the uncooked part and did not mention this to our server.\n \nDuring this time, the restaurant had filled up somewhat but was nowhere near maximum capacity.  I would estimate that the dining room was halfway full.  As we waited for our entrees to come out, we began to notice that other tables that had ordered after us were getting food.  During this time, one member of our party requested a coffee refill.  This request went unfulfilled for several minutes even though other servers were walking around the dining room refilling other diners\u2019 cups.  When our server finally made it back to our table and began pouring, it was immediately obvious that the coffee had not been properly brewed-it had the watery appearance of tea.  It took another few minutes to grab our server\u2019s attention again and inform him that the coffee was off.  He seemed a bit rattled by this. He first took our coffee mugs to the server station, seeming unsure what to do next. Finally he took the mugs back to the kitchen and several more minutes elapsed before he came back with drinkable coffee.\n \nWe continued to wait for our entrees, at one point noticing that the party that had been seated immediately after our arrival had completed their meal and was leaving the restaurant.  At approximately 11:40, I asked our server if he knew when our food would be ready, as we\u2019d been waiting for what seemed like an unreasonably long time.  He was clearly rattled at this point and said that several big parties had come in at the same time and the kitchen was backed up.  He assured us that our food was coming up immediately and then disappeared back to the kitchen.  Several minutes later, unable to locate our server, I asked another server if I could speak to the manager on duty.  I was told that acting manager was the head chef, who was in the kitchen and too busy cooking to speak with me.  I explained to this server that we\u2019d been here for nearly an hour and planned to leave.  He kindly said he understood and let us know that we wouldn\u2019t be charged for the drinks or doughnuts. We left at approximately 11:55.\n \nWe might have been able to cut the restaurant a break for the raw doughnuts, bad coffee and incredibly slow service, chalking it all up to one bad day. But then one of our party, who had excused himself to use the restroom while we talked to the server, overhead the staff in the kitchen talking about how unreasonable we were\u2014something along the lines of \u201cThey\u2019re complaining about how slow it is when the restaurant is full?!\u201d There\u2019s no excuse for that. The restaurant wasn\u2019t full. We had been understanding FOR AN HOUR. If someone had communicated with us about whatever chaos was going on in the kitchen, or if the server had apologized for (as we suspect) neglecting to put in our order in a timely way or maybe even at all, we could easily have been persuaded to stay. But to be ignored and then insulted, well that\u2019s too much.

But as soon as we walked in, it was off to a bad start. The host seemed to have missplaced the reservation and then when we were seated- every server walked by us at least 5 times and we waited upwards of 25 minutes before we were even acknowledged. The good news is that the executive chef offered a bottle of champagne as compensation, although there was no apology from either the chef nor the server.\n\nThe menu is relatively limited, but impressive. It is certainly more refined than what you would normally find in a smaller Midwestern town, and is alike to an upper-class Chicago restaurant. \n\nThe food itself was very hit or miss. The brussel sprouts lacked any flavor besides \"fried.\" The aioli, although clearly homemade, lacked flavor and tasted similar to slightly sweetened mucous (and for the bacon aioli, it tasted like slightly sweet and salty mucous). It lacked acidity or any bright flavors (or any flavor at all, to be honest). \n\nThe lamb was bland. There was a large lack of seasoning and the vegetables also put on the plate were clearly an afterthought and acted more as a garnish than something edible. The meat and cheese options for a homemade charcuterie were very basic and boring. When we went, there were also out of many plates/dishes, including some meats and cheeses from the meat/cheese menu and the grouper (which is what I wanted to order). This was in and of itself disappointing.\n\nThe saving grace was the loster ravioli, although I only got 4 pieces of ravioli. Call me American, but that still seems like a small portion. While limited, it was delicious. Again, clearly homemade but the balance of the dish was perfect and I was dipping bread in the leftover saurce. I absolutely recommend it. \n\nThe atmosphere is good for a date, but know what you're getting into first.

The store opens into V. Picasso. The design is lots of barn wood and other wood features. There are heavy castle type doors throughout. If you think the decor is awesome...well then the bathroom will blow you away. Can't even describe it. Classy and luxurious but not over the top. \n\nOk, so what about the food and service??? Well our server was very nice. The food came out fast. Had the V Breakfast. 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and half biscuit. The ingredients were fresh and local. The preparation and presentation was definitely hipster cheque. My daughter ordered a side of bacon...it was interwoven. Very yummy. \n\nThey finished up their meals while i went in for a consult on my custom wedding band.

First of all the building it's self is well done and charming right down to the \"Bevelo\" real gas lights out in front (these are the copper lights handmade by a small company in New Orleans who supplies the French Quarter with their lights. They are also available in electric models l put on my own house. The bar is nice and a great place to stop in for a glass of wine or drink before a movie or event at the Virginia. The dinner menu is creative but the results are not always consistent. I am not sure what is going on in the kitchen but maybe they have had changes in the staff. It might be better if they had a few more simple items on the menu done well.

We had walked past this newer restaurant several times in the past few months and decided to try it out after taking a look at the menu. I saw Venison. I love venison. I have never seen venison at a restaurant and was curious.\n\nMaking an online reservation was a piece of cake. Their website is quite good. We showed up and they had a table immediately ready for us.\n\nIn lieu of a lot of verbiage I will just say every part of the experience was top notch (service, wine/drink selection, ambiance, decoration) and get into the interesting part which is ordering venison in a restaurant.\n\nGrowing up in a farming/hunting based community I have had my fair share of deer meat and love it. It can also be scary because it can taste quite gamy. I had these fears mixed in with the curiosity. This was no old-buck venison though. I had a butter knife and didn't need anything else as it was that tender. Flavor of the meat mixed with the potatoes, pearl onions, and rest of the course melded together into the best meal I have had in a long while. Best meal I have had in the area outside of Gibson City. This place is certainly going to easily go punch-for-punch with the local favorites (Radio, Destihl, Bacaro, The Alley).\n\nAfter sharing these thoughts with our wonderful waiter, and getting an amazing french press irish coffee to finish up the meal the head chef and sous chef came out to talk to me about the meal, the farm in Wisconsin? where they get this wonderful stuff, the local farm that they have a partnership with for everything they can locally source.\n\nLittle pricey for the area, but well worth it for what you get despite.\n\n6/5 if I could.
