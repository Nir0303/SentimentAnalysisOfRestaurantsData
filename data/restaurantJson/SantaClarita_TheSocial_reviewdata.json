Unfortunately they were below the standards that we have come to expect of them. The usual fine service we have experienced in the past was very slow. Perhaps they were understaffed that night. We ordered the crab cake appetizer and it was over cooked. They said that's the way it always comes but we have had it many times before and knew better. They made new ones which were the delicious morsels we were used to. We also split the Mac & Cheese for an appetizer and it was delicious as always. I had a blackened salmon that was a large portion and tasty but too under cooked in the center for my taste. Two of the group had the Osso Buco and it was delicious as usual ( my wife's favorite) and comes with mushroom risotto. We also had the rack of lamb which was very good. For desert we had the lemon cake which was moist and flavorful. We also had another desert that was white cake with fruit that was very good.

After reading the reviews definitely had positive expectations.  Our party was two couples.  My husband had a martini, the escargot and the jambalaya.  I had a martini, the crab cakes and the chicken piccata.  Our friends both had the filet mignon and one had a martini.  \n\nMy husband's escargot was slightly overcooked and while it had a flavorful sauce it was rather unattractivey presented with thick sauce over the shells of  escargot. He said the jambalaya was good but could have used a little salt.  My crabcake patty had nice flavor but no discernible lumps of crabmeat and were a little thin and small.  The accompanying salad was nice and this dish was nicely presented.  My chicken in the piccata consisted of 3 too thick and slightly overcooked pieces of chicken and the sauce was just tart with capers.  I frequently have this dish in other establishments as it is a favorite of mine.  Usually the chicken is gently cooked medallions(pounded thinner) and the sauce is tart but has other dimensions like garlic, butter and stock.  The angel hair pasta was just a portion of pasta sans sauce or oil or topping of any kind that I could detect.  The broccoli was good but a kind of tiny portion. Our friends said the filet was nicely cooked.  \n\nNone of the dishes except the crabcakes seemed nicely presented.  So, 3 martinis , 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, no wine, no coffee and no desserts our bill was $145 without gratuity. Not bad but we don't mind paying a little more when the food is a bit better.

It is located in a strip mall in Newhall. We didn't let this put us off, after all, there isn't much scenery in Newhall, it's all basically one parking lot or another for views. our waitress was prompt and professional. Our drinks were served right away, as well was out food. We started out with the Grilled Artichoke...which was good...however the mayo dip was really bland and we didn't use it. The bread was served with an interesting tampenade, but served in a way that made you wonder what it was. We ordered the Filet. As tender as it was, there just wasn't very much flavor to it, again bland. The potatoes were over done and dry. Where as the service was very good, I just couldn't give it more than an average. If it hadn't been for the service, it may not have even made that...The place is a little pricey for the atmosphere and the food we were served.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-10T10:13:58-0500", "location_id": "1533047", "id": "248662286", "user": {"username": "tGypsyMomma", "user_location": {"name": "Ventura, California", "id": "60769"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Xmas eve dinner", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33047-d1533047-r246600848-m11068-The_Social-Santa_Clarita_California.html#review246600848", "text": "Very disappointed in our Xmas eve dinner at the social.
