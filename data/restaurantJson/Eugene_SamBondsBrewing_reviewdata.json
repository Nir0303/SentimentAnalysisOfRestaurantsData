I accidentally discovered SB while breezing through Eugene several months ago.  Even in that short time they\u2019ve started to flesh out their operation. \n \nThe first thing you will notice is that the area is very pristine, even with construction.  Cool-looking but lifeless buildings look down at SB\u2019s wood-paneled abode.  It\u2019s a little island of quiet, and best of all, parking was not an issue either of the two times I swung by.  The outdoor seating on the sidewalk is perfect for catching rays. \n \nThe beers suffice.  Good microbrew stuff.  Atmosphere is pleasant.  Seems like a locals\u2019 hangout in that everybody there appeared to know one another.  The newness of everything is what grabbed me. \n \nSaying all that, it\u2019s still hard to get a definitive read on them.  I like food carts in general, but their unpredictability can be a turn-off.  Case in point, another brewery I swung by had a cart specializing in wings.  Which I love, but at that particular moment was not what I sought.  On my second venture to SB, some Costa Rican dude was setting up his cart.  But, he wasn\u2019t open yet, we were starving, and hence in a dilemma.  Hopefully they can get that sorted out. \n \nStill, thumbs up.  They are off to a good start.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-05-30T13:55:59-0400", "location_id": "8144548", "id": "275817660", "user": {"username": "Chris M", "user_location": {"name": "Grand Ronde, Oregon", "id": "51890"}}}]}
