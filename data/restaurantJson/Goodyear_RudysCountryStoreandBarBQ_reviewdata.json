The menu is on the wall and meat is ordered by the pound, side dishes are served in a container and all put into a basket you carry to the table. You set your table and clean up afterwards. All the serving containers and silverware are disposable. That food was awesome and some of the BEST we have had in a long time and the prices are great.  Cream corn is very good.
