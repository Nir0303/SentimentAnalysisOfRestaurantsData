I had been to a Buca di Beppo before (fifteen years ago) in Cincinnati Ohio and; although it wasn't anything to write home about, it was passable because of the food was slightly above average but, the service and atmosphere were enthusiastic and fun - really made the place.  This Buca di Beppo in Davie, Florida had none of that and made my mothers 95th birthday a great disappointment. \n\nWhat went wrong?  We went on a Groupon the first time but because it was my mothers 95th birthday purchased the $30 dessert and had entrees that exceeded the Groupon so to give back a little to the restaurant ( we know Groupons can hurt the bottomline!)  The portions are large when it comes to the pastas but the veal saltebucco was tough and a standard portion.  When we mentioned the veal was overcooked to the waitress she said sorry and that was it - not exactly how restaurants who wish to survive should respond.  The bread; which they point out in the beginning is made daily, is a waste of calories (worth what you pay for it - nothing) and the dessert was enormous and tasted pre-made and boxed.  We left.  The next day we called the restaurant and asked to speak to the manager he wasn't available so we left a message.  After two days with no response from the manager we called corporate as: having owned two restaurants, I know that it is important to get back to customers and thought that now upper management should know.  \n\nWithin an hour I had a call from the manager of the local restaurant and then a call from the Vice President of the region at Corporate.  The manager; frankly, needs to polish his skills a bit but; and the reason I gave the restaurant two stars and not one, the regional Vice President knew his stuff and was very accommodating and interested in what we had to say.  Frankly all we wanted was to tell him our experience in a hope it would help them and we weren't looking for anything.  As it turned out though he sent a small token of his appreciation for the feedback and we returned to try it again before writing this review - hoping it was not the restaurant and just a bad night we experienced prior.  \n\nSecond (and last) try for the restaurant.  We went on a Thursday evening early so we would avoid a busy time.  Reception still lack luster and with no real enthusiasm, service better then the first time but still lacking knowledge, finesse and enthusiasm.  We ordered pasta thinking that may be their schtick, it isn't - my ravioli was a big pocket of dough and tasteless cheese filling (Stouffer's anyone??). I added the meatball which was good and tender - $6.00 extra for the one meatball.  The seafood pasta; which is supposed to be filled with mussels, calamari, clams, shrimp, scallops etc, had overcooked pasta, noticeable mussels, canned clams (chopped), tiny shrimp and not many, very little calamari (2 small pieces!) and no scallops (although their version doesn't advertise it on their menu so although most of the traditional Fruit de Mar's we have had would have them we can't expect it here - the price $28.00 expensive for what we received.  We also had soup and for dessert cannoli for dessert. The bill was close to $100 for two people and just not worth it. Sad to say as I really enjoyed the one in Cincinnati.  \n\nThis restaurant needs an overhaul in most every department.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "bucalove, Guest Relations Manager at Buca di Beppo, responded to this review", "text": "We are so sorry to hear you did not have a good experience both times you visited our Davie location.

The first time we ate at a BDB was in Houston.  The experience was so relaxed and fun; returning home to Ft. Lauderdale we discovered one within 5 miles of our house.  A pleasant surprise.  This is a family or party place.  Love getting friends together for dinner there; around a big round table, or long skinny one.  There are many small dining rooms, so you're not in a big cavernous place.  It gives the illusion of a much smaller restaurant.  If you're LUCKY, you might even snag the table in the kitchen.  That's always a favorite.  You actually sit in a round booth, facing the cooks in the kitchen.  The kids especially like it.  It can get noisy, but that's part of the charm.  I come from an Italian family, so laughter and noise is expected around the dinner table. Many of the dishes are  served family style (if you like) with enough servings to go around.  It's not gourmet, but it is Italian. The photos on the wall are intriguing - and I could swear some of my relatives have been framed and hung there. All the rooms have names, and in addition to the kitchen booth, there is also a very large round table, all by itself in the \"Pope's Room.\"  So go!  Enjoy!  Mangia!
