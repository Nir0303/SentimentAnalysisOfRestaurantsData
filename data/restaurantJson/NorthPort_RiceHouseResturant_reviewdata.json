There are only a few Thai dishes so it really isn't a Thai restaurant.  I ordered there just about every week.\n\nLast few times I ordered, my food quality and quantity was disappointing.  Asked for General Tso's Chicken to be extra extra crispy and it was not crispy at all.  They don't fill containers as tight as other Chinese Restaurants.  \n\nThen, the last time I ordered, was a little odd.  I walked in and asked if I was too late to order off the lunch menu.  She said yes.  I asked by how much, 2 minutes?  She looks at me and said 1 minute!!!  Mind you, I was a regular customer and 1 minute was a big deal to her to not let me order off the lunch menu???!  Rules are rules, but maybe their clock is faster than mine or vice versa.  When I questioned it, she said that what I ordered wasn't on the lunch menu anyhow.  I told her that I could order something else.  Order wasn't changed and I paid regular price with a 10% off coupon which is a lesser amount off than the lunch menu vs. dinner menu cost.  I hope the few dollars was worth losing a good customer.  To me, it wasn't so much the money amount, it was the principle of the whole thing.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that they go into the dining room area and fill wontons for soup where people are dining.  Not very sanitary.\n\nLast week was the last time I will be ordering from this restaurant.  The people are nice, but that doesn't make up for food quality, quantity and being 1 minute late to order off lunch menu.  Not a good way to treat customers if you really want them to come back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-15T14:15:08-0400", "location_id": "2319366", "id": "428250665", "user": {"username": "kathleen m", "user_location": {"name": "Painted Post, New York", "id": "48356"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "not good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34488-d2319366-r421556873-m11068-Rice_House_Resturant-North_Port_Florida.html#review421556873", "text": "Went there for dinner and the service was very bad .
