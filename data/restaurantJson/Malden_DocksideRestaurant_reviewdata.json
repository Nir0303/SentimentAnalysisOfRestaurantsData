The management is pitiful. I went there with 12 people and we ate food and had a few alcoholic drinks. Our tab ended up being roughly 250 which is less than 25 dollars a person. The dining room got shut down, and since it was my birthday we decided to go to the bar. The manager told us that we were cut off due to a big tab after we even tipped our waitress more than generously. Meanwhile, while i was there the weekend before, there was a fight. As the guy was belligerent and trying to fight everyone our waitress says \"that guy always does this when he comes here.\" So, the management thinks that 12 people that spend 20 a person on food and drinks and has a Designated driver, is too drunk, but they decide to constantly serve a local who always gets kicked out because the serve him to much. Horrible job, the place needs to be shutdown.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Lisa U, Owner at Dockside Restaurant, responded to this review", "text": "Hello -\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding our locations.
