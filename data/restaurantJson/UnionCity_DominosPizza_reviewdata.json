They are fast, the food is always warm when it gets here (hot sometimes) and it's very tasty.  I order from them quite often.  I usually order on line, I don't go in to the place.  They have excellent pasta in a bread bowl (or a dish), and pretty good garlic bread!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-17T18:54:46-0400", "location_id": "5015275", "id": "428986138", "user": {"username": "ffoxxyred", "user_location": {"name": "Union City, California", "id": "33204"}}}]}
