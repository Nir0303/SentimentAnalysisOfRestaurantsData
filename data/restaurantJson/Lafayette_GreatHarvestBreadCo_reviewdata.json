From the first bite, the quality of ingredients and use of whole grain flour is evident. If you are looking for an option to cater a breakfast meeting, consider getting a tray or muffins, scones, and fruit bars. This is sure to be a huge hit! The giant cinnamon rolls are also hard to resist.\n\nIn terms of bread, they have so many different varieties including your standard white, wheat, sourdough. I love the cinnamon swirl. (The pumpkin swirl is good, but cinnamon is my favorite.) Recently, I picked up a loaf of \"Red, White, and Blue\" (cranberries, blueberries, and apples) at the local farmer's market. Yum! It was easy to slice and even survived the toaster. The wheat rolls are hearty and freeze very well. You really can't go wrong with whatever you choose.
