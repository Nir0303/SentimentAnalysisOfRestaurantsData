I had the curry wrust by Shane (my favorite cook) he even stayed late to cook me my dinner I told him it tasted like the Munich train station (which is a complement ) best curry wrust I've ever had I had no doubt Shane would make it taste just as good. I LOVE Das Boot, It's a place where a half German woman feels at home & totally great full I can go to Das Boot to get a cheap (much cheaper then Germany) 1Lt beer for $4 & Great authentic German Food in Norman. I LOVE Shane the chef & the food & beer.
