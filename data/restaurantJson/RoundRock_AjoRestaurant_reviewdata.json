On the suggestions of our server, we had the Fried Chicken Thighs with mashed potatoes and zucchini noodles as well as the three cheese Lobster Mac.  They were both so delicious, we had to share!  For dessert we had a yummy chocolate roll with a cream cheese filling, covered with a chocolate Ganache along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

We first went into one of the others on the street, but found it a bit noisy for a quiet lunch. When we stopped into Ajo, I asked to see a menu, concerned that their offerings might be too few to please the two of us. We decided to stay, and found the atmosphere peaceful and quite lovely.\n\nWe were seated by the hostess, who we later found out is the chef's sister-in-law, beginning our understanding of this fundamentally family-run pure food place. When the server came I was still not able to make a choice. Although all sounded fabulous, I wanted something light, and preferably seafood. To complicate matters, I preferred scallops over the featured trout. \n\nNo problem! The server found out from the chef that I could have scallops on the even further altered salad, and carefully told me there would be an additional $1 charge for the substitution, bringing it to $15. I thought that was very fair. My husband ordered the 8oz hamburger ($14.00), which came with fries. His Ajo burger was delicious, tender, tasty, and cooked to perfection. The fries were excellent--not greasy, but just the right crispness. \n\nMy salad came, and was perfect! Two sizable scallops topped the dish, which was prepared just as I'd ask. The scallops were amazing! They were juicy and not at all chewy--delicious! We were fully satisfied and prepared to leave when finished, when the hostess tempted us with a description of their incredible bread pudding. \n\nIt is served in a hot skillet on a platter, made with black cherries, white chocolate, caramel, and topped with a large scoop of ice cream. It took about 10 minutes to prepare, and was worth ever bit of the $7 price! I am not a bread pudding person--never found one I liked.  Until now! This was huge for the two of us to share, and was crumbly on top, hot, perfectly cooled by the delicious ice cream, and we found ourselves scraping every last drop out of the skillet. Highly recommend it!\n\nThe atmosphere was elegant and peaceful, with tables not crowded together. The service was perfect, and the food a delightful experience! We can't wait to return!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-04T13:18:23-0500", "location_id": "9854074", "id": "352959271", "user": {"username": "janels", "user_location": {"name": "Cedar Park, Texas", "id": "55599"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Food is amazing, restaurant is quiet and nice for a date", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56584-d9854074-r351412379-m11068-Ajo_Restaurant-Round_Rock_Texas.html#review351412379", "text": "My husband and I went to Ajo with his parents on a Saturday night to celebrate our birthdays.

The scallop dish was AMAZING. I ate every little bit of it. The corn pur\u00e9e is heaven. My husband liked the pork belly, but what he really loved was the extra side of mashed potatoes with green chile gravy. My in-laws both enjoyed the trout dish as well. We also had the triple chocolate cheesecake for dessert which was decadent and very tasty. \n\nWe liked our dinner so much that we came back the following Wednesday for my birthday dinner. We tried the bread with black Ajo sauce and the fried chicken with mashed potatoes. Everything we're tried here has been amazing! I can't wait to try the brunch menu. :) keep up the good work, Ajo!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-27T13:26:31-0500", "location_id": "9854074", "id": "351412379", "user": {"username": "Kendall B", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}]}
