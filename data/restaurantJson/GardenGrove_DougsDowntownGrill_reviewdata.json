Arriving at 6:30 the restaurant only had a few booths occupied so we thought we had plenty of time for the 8:00 play.  Wrong!\nWe told the hostess we wanted quick service and she said she would get our server.  10 minutes later at 6:40 still no server but we noticed a server at a table across from us waiting on a table of two women who had come in after us.  We asked that server to wait on us first but he declined  and after a couple of more minutes our server arrived.  We quickly ordered in under a minute and told her we were anxious to be served because we were going to the play.  She assured us it would be no problem.  We ordered no wine or even ice, just water, as we thought that might slow up the serving process.  It took until 7:00 for the soup (a delicious turkey pot pie) and the rather ordinary side salad to arrive with mostly iceberg lettuce.  No tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. and only a couple of romaine leaves.  By 7:10 we had finished the soup and salad and anxiously waited for our entree.  And waited, and waited, and waited, and waited.  Others had arrived and we noticed they were being served bread with their soup and salads but we were not offered any.  Tick tick 7:15,  tick tick 7:20, tick tick 7:25, tick tick 7:30, tick tick 7:35.  We asked about our meal as we had now been in the restaurant over an hour and our server apologized but said they were busy because of the play.  They were now busy but they were not busy when we arrived over an hour earlier.  Our meals of ribs and try tip arrived we had 12 minutes to wolf it down before we had to leave to pick up our tickets at will-call at the Gem theatre.  I complained about no bread and they finally brought us some.  I had a couple of bites of the trip-tip which was surprisingly good and tried to eat the vegetables getting a few down before I had to leave to get our tickets.  We were given boxes and we boxed up the meat and potatoes (scalloped rather than twice-baked listed on the menu that we wanted.  We left the vegetables.  On our bill they had included $2.00 extra for mushrooms on our trip tip that we ordered but did not receive.  I rushed out to get our tickets and my wife went to the restroom to wash up.  We met up at the lobby of the theatre, stressed out from the experience and exhausted.  The play Bye Bye Birdie was terrific.  At intermission we ran into the party of 4 that had been across from us in the restaurant and they ended up having all of their food boxed and Doug's felt so bad they comped the meal for them.  Ours was not comped and we were the ones served a late meal, no bread until it did not matter, and no refills on our water.  My wife thought some of the wait staff and especially the hostess were dressed slovenly.  1 1/2 hours is not enough time for this slow serving restaurant so if you are going to give it a try before a play I would say you need 2  1/2 hours to be safe.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-24T14:07:21-0400", "location_id": "1142803", "id": "385655381", "user": {"username": "Lighthouse2006", "user_location": {"name": "San Clemente, California", "id": "33012"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Yummy food; happy service!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32420-d1142803-r364719767-m11068-Doug_s_Downtown_Grill-Garden_Grove_California.html#review364719767", "text": "This is a really nice local restaurant with yummy food.

But that is exactly what my wife and I did - ordered pasta at a grill.\n\nBut first things first. We went on a Saturday evening, and the place was only half full. People - it's only about 3 miles from the madhouse of Disney - go give it a try. Staff was friendly, and yes, Doug the owner, stopped by to make sure everything was fine. Servings sizes are large, so be aware. Ambiance is muted and good for conversations. It is in a college area, but it is definitely not a college student hang out.\n\nNow the food. We did order the egg rolls - not on the menu - and they were very good. These are more southwest egg rolls, not Chinese. Stuffed with a gooey  cheese and a small amount of a slightly spicy meat mixture - maybe Chorizo. A nice sweet dipping sauce to slightly cool them.\n\nOur pasta dishes came with either a soup or salad, and we both opted for the salads. Salads, like other dishes here, are big. My wife got the Balsamic vinaigrette dressing and said it was very full flavored. I got the house dressing which is homemade blue cheese. I found it to be extremely mild - almost no blue cheese flavor. Not bad, just not really blue cheese.\n\nThere are only 3 pasta dishes on the menu. My wife got the penne pasta with shrimp and loved it. I got the pasta special, which was shrimp, artichoke hearts, and fontina cheese over egg noodles. Both dishes came with two large pieces of garlic toast. I really enjoyed mi dish as well, and both made really good left overs for lunch the next day.\n\nMy suggestion is to give it a try.

My wife's was well done instead of medium). Bear this in mind when ordering. \n\nDesserts are oversized. This is a bit of a turn-off when you're already full. \n\nTemperature of the establishment was too low.

We stumbled upon Doug's Downtown Grill! What a treat it was! Located in historic Grarden Grove, it was nothing fancy, but looked nice from the outside. The reviews on trip advisor helped us make the decision to give it a try! Boy were we happy we did! The service was exceptional,the owner was there overseeing everything,with a great big smile! Let's get to the food.....first we ordered the egg rolls, (can't find them on the menu) but our waitress suggested them. Dont  know exactly what they had inside, they were more like a cross between an egg roll and a burrito, very scrumptious! Our friend ordered the Ahi tuna salad, fantastic! My girlfriend and I split the prime rib dinner (16oz) it was out of this world! Vegetables were done just right, salad was big enough for us to split, but had no idea it would be so big so we ordered an extra dinner salad. We also had the twice baked potatoes and they were delightful! You can tell everything is homemade! We were too full to try the buttermilk pie, but waitress told us it was his grandmothers homemade recipe!
