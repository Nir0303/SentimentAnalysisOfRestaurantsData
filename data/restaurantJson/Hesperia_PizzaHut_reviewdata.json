I told him that I didn't know offhand where one was either. So he took his flashlight and proceeded to look in his car while my pizza waited. Finally he came back to the door... and told me he couldn't find one. So I said fine; I'd go look. But I pointed out to him that it was not right to require me to sign a credit card slip if he wasn't going to provide a pen. Then to my surprise and disgust he said that \"that isn't my job\"... \nThen and there I decided that I didn't need that pizza that badly and shut my door and went inside and ordered from a different pizza delivery company. \nUpon communicating with the manager of this Pizza Hut branch; I got a similar attitude. I asked if the owner was available because I know these are frequently (if not always) franchises; but was told he/she was not available. \nIn the past we had gotten decent pizza from this branch.
