We've been wanting to try for sometime and finally visited on Sunday (which, by the way, is \"all day happy hour\")---how awesome is that?  \n\nMimosas are included on happy hour all day, as are a selection of a few beers to choose from (delicious, hand-crafted beer I might add).  However, once we reviewed the menu, decided we had to try the Thai Basil Daiquiri Martini.  My husband and I both ordered one (they were that good).  BEST martini I've ever had, and I've had my share across the country as I travel a lot (both personally and for work).  It is \nover-the- top good.  Refreshing, crisp, perfect combination of flavors that work really well together. \n\nWe ordered a few things to try, including the Ginger Slaw, Mashers, and Vegetable Risotto (I am vegetarian).  All perfectly flavored and exceptional pairing with our drinks.  My husband also tried the beef and pork tacos (which he really enjoyed).  Everything was really good.  We did want to order the Chocolate Bread Pudding (to take home with us), but they were out...next time, since we'll be back.  \n\nLoved the ambience, warm, very welcoming.  Seating is somewhat limited, but very comfortable and inviting. \n\nService was excellent.\n\nThe only comment I'll offer (for the four stars vs. a five) is that the portion sizes are pretty small.  They are priced appropriately, but do except small plates, as they are more a tapas size.  We expected that for the sides we ordered, but not the risotto based on the placement on the menu.  We would suggest asking your server in advance if the size is large enough to share.  Size is perfect for me, but a bit on the smaller size for what my husband would normally enjoy.  \n\nAlso, check their calendar. They were hosting a \"stout\" tasting for a small group the day we were there (which looked super fun)...and something we'll keep an eye out down the road. \n\nBeer selection is fantastic (draft and bottled w/rotating taps by the appearance of the chalkboard listing specials, et al).   Unique food items made with craft and love.\n\nFantastic place...we will be back!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-22T07:37:56-0500", "location_id": "7778588", "id": "350006782", "user": {"username": "Jodi R", "user_location": {"name": "Loveland, Colorado", "id": "33530"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "It's pretty good", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33530-d7778588-r326526029-m11068-Laureate_Publick_House-Loveland_Colorado.html#review326526029", "text": "Super cute place but the service is mediocre at best.
