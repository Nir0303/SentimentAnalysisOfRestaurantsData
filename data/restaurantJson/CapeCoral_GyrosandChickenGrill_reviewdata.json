It is incredibly good! \n\nThe German guy who runs the truck is a gem: so friendly, joyous & funny. The girl working there (from Ohio) was equally charming. They quickly prepared our food to order & I was amazed by how positively fresh & tasty our gyros were! (I was apprehensive when I approached the truck expecting maybe unsanitary conditions or something odd or disgusting. How wrong was I! It is scrupulously clean & they have a large fridge onboard. The gyros are not made ahead and kept in a warmer - they are grilled on the truck!) \n\nOur perfectly fresh pitas were grilled exactly right. The tomatoes were fresher than the tomatoes I bought at the nice (not big box discount) grocery store yesterday. The gyro meat was excellent - high quality, peppery & spicy without being overwhelming. I would love to report about the tzatziki sauce, but I ordered it on the side fearing it might be watery & ruin the gyro. It was not a bit watery - it was fresh & firm. However, I was enjoying my gyro so much I forgot to dip it into the tzatziki! Oh well, it is a good excuse to return next Spring Break!\n\nHe has a special buy 3, get one free, so we thought to buy extras for our El Salvadorian friends who live in Cape Coral. Our friends had never heard of this place and did not know what gyros are. Guess what? They absolutely love these gyros & were sure to get the exact location from us so they can return! \n\nIf an El Salvadorian grandma who has never heard of a gyro loves this place you might want to give it a try, too.
