The offer a chili dog, sauerkraut, chicago, tex-mex, baked bean and plain.\n\nWe had chili dogs conisting of a mild, all-ground meat chile atop a dog (which was just a little larger than the bun) that had been griddled or heated on one of those hot-roller hot dog heaters/cookers.  The chili was decent, the dog had flavor and the dog had not been boiled/steamed to death--the thing was not gigantic, but it had flavor.  \n\nOne of us also had a baked bean dog (call it a \"beany-weenie\"?), which was inhaled quite handily, so I think it was good!  Two of us had the plain with the usual toppings: onions, mustard, relish, etc.  They were supposed to have a jalapeno relish also, but I did not check it out.\n\nAll of our dogs were hot, fresh and pretty dang good for a buck each.\n\nWe all split an order of--onion rings!  Hot and fresh, they were a little greasy (probably cooked too cold), but it was a huge order of rings and they were fresh. No salt was needed as the salted batter nicely set off the thick rings.\n\nFor four of us, cost for dinner?  $11.55 (if I remember correctly, maybe a buck more) for 8 dogs and the onion rings.  Very reasonable and it is supporting a LOCAL business, not a chain--Yea!\n\nWe drank water with, but we did note the small but nice collection of bottled beers in the case up front, by the register.\n\nRecommended; I will try to go there again to check out the rest of their menu as the prices seemed very reasonable.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-04-15T15:06:00-0400", "location_id": "5586813", "id": "265942641", "user": {"username": "Lm D", "user_location": {"name": "Rancho Cucamonga, California", "id": "32940"}}}]}
