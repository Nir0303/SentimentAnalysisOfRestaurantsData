But I can tell you that is false. This theater was formally named the Starplex Cinemas in Irvine, CA but it has since been taken over by the AMC chain. Every week you may get one or even two new movies coming here. I think the movies are maybe about 2 months out of \"regular\" theaters before hitting this place. That's not too bad at all. We all lead busy lives so there is a chance you might have missed these movies when they were in theaters the first time. This is a great place to catch up on your movies...plus you can't beat the price of just $1.99 per person. My family of four normally pays about $50 just in admission to go to a regular theater. What do we pay now? Just $7.96!! Sure the popcorn and sodas still cost the normal higher price but with the money you save it doesn't hurt as much.
