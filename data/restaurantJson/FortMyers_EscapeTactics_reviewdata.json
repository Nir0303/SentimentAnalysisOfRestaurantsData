Myers finally has a few escape game businesses. I have tried 3 different places in the past. Two in tampa and one in orlando. Escape tactics was definitely a great experience. Even though we didn't get out within the 60 minutes they still let us finish the riddles to escape as there was no group going behind us. The staff dressed in the theme of the room (prohibition theme) so that was fun. The room was fully decorated in the theme is well which I love. Plenty of riddles and locks to solve. We got stuck on a few but they gave us hints to help us along. As a new business that just opened a few weeks ago they definitely are doing a great job and I highly recommend it to anyone to try!
