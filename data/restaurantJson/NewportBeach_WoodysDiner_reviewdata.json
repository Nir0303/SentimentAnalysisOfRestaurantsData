After she jumped, she asked me if the Van I was standing in front of was mine.  The van was for a mobile doggie wash.  I was taken aback by the comment by the entitled lady that I almost did not hear her tell us of Woody's Diner at the Lido. \n\nThankfully, I did hear her though and walked away to my car before I was stuck washing her dog.  We proceeded down the street to the Lido and parked.  Woody's is set deep in the back of the building in front nearest the street.   As you approach, the cooking odors makes you hungrier.  We were seated right away by a lovely hostess and within minutes, our waitress appeared to get our drinks.  Her name was Shawny, an alluring Polynesian Hawaiian woman, that was refreshingly honest and sincere. She offered the specials which had funny names but ended up as delicious breakfast. My wife ordered a special skillet platter with scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese and Kielbasa sausage (three large pieces).  She enjoyed every bite but brought half back to the hotel.  A coworker ordered the fruit covered, cinnamon infused French Toast that he declared the best he's ever had.  My omelet was cooked to perfection with lots of ham bits and diced peppers.  I had a side of fruit that was ripe and mouthwatering.  The fruit was so ripe it melted in your mouth.  The omelet was cooked light and tasty and as good as anyone else's choice.  Shawny came back to us many times to see that we were pleased, many times without saying a word.  When we stopped her to ask us about the her wonderful story, she was very talkative and humorous.  We were normal people talking with a normal person and enjoying her company.  The food was great, the service wonderful and the place had the charm of an oceanside restaurant.

As always I bring my dogs with me.  My snow white Bishon always sits on the chair next to me.  Well this time the busboy came out and said the my Bishon could not sit on their dirty, rusty wrought iron chair and had to sit on the dirty concrete.   You could tell that he was embarrassed and the chicken manager sent him out to do his dirty work.  So Sunday (not my choice) we went here again and I brought my own chair for my Bishon.   Well, I was so pissed off when I saw 2 dogs sitting on the chairs next to their owners and one person feeding his dog out of his plate.  Not one word was said to them.  So I will never go there again and the food is ok!!   \nThank you for reading my review.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-12-26T12:27:57-0500", "location_id": "4582042", "id": "245964253", "user": {"username": "Charrenee", "user_location": {"name": "Crestline, California", "id": "32265"}}}]}
