Nice vibe and pretty busy when we visited, which felt good. The service was a little stiff to start with, though some chat and a little humour soon brought the waiters to life who became part of our evening with good spirit, wit and great service. The wine was perfect for the meal, too. Perfect for a special treat with friends or a family occasion. Value for money?

I was surprised to see that it wasn't packed, but I guess everyone was at the Adele concert ;) Upon arriving we sat at the bar. The bar was not well maintained and I was a bit shocked (dirty glasses all over the place and yet it was pretty empty). We ordered our drinks and the \"bartender\" questioned what we wanted...kind of odd (we ordered gin & tonic and she asked if we wanted martinis?). Another bartender swooped in and he was great. We sat down to eat and our waiter adopted a strange accent and told us about the specials in a quirky unprofessional way \"The Wagyu beef is massaged by me personally every day\", etc. Too much. It's Morton's not TGIFridays. I didn't like that. Considering that the place was almost empty, I was surprised by how long our steaks took. Our waiter kept coming back to our table to provide another joke and we deadpanned that maybe we should have ordered a pizza. \"And how do you like your pizza madam?\" was the response...\"with double anchovies\" I dryly answered - because by this time the carrying on was ridiculous. Our steaks came and were delicious and the sides were huge and very good. And you know that waiter brought me a huge side of anchovies? Pretty sassy. Anyway, the food was consistent and I have no complaints.
