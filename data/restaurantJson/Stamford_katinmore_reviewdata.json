First of all, they should take the \"n more\" out of the title as it's pretty much just kati rolls (roti rolls) on the menu. The rolls are great.  Just the right amount of spice and flavor.  The bread wrapping (a parantha) is excellent.  But one roll is really not enough for a meal, so you're talking about $10 or so for 2 plus the price of a drink, which makes this a bit pricy for a lunch place.  It is not kid friendly.  There is no bathroom that they will let customers use, so you have to trek to the mall when a kid needs to go.  And there are no booster seats or high chairs.  The lussies are tasty and they have Thums Up soda which i have only seen in India.  Worth going, but be warned of the trades-offs you will be making.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-05-09T19:31:52-0400", "location_id": "7233860", "id": "271030168", "user": {"username": "LawGod2", "user_location": {"name": "Norwalk, Connecticut", "id": "33871"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Indian food in Stamford", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33936-d7233860-r240571007-m11068-Kati_n_more-Stamford_Connecticut.html#review240571007", "text": "If you are in Stamford,  us & looking for some indian food specially rolls,  this is the place.  they hv both veg and non veg rolls, ice cream, lassi as well.
