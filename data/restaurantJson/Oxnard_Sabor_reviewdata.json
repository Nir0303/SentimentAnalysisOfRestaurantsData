This restaurant is downtown Oxnard on 6th just off Oxnard Blvd. It has parking outside and on the street. The building is very recognizable with a huge whale painted on the exterior. Inside it feels very colorful and I loved the mural on the ceiling with clouds and all sorts of flying birds. It was a very hot evening and uncomfortable inside the restaurant. They had ceiling fans and a floor fan going, but it was not enough to move the air. It was hot and humid and distracted from the meal. We were the only customers in the restaurant. As we came in - one couple was leaving, but there were no others eating. As we were close to finishing, a group of 4 entered. We were not aware that there was no waitress/waiter service and that you had to place your order at the counter. The man behind the counter was very nice - but you don't really get time, or a good description of all that is available. I ordered a combo platter of carnitas - with beans and rice. The serving was on the small side - unusual for Mexican, especially with the rice and the beans. The carnitas was very dry and had no sauce. I used salsa from the self serve salsa bar and this made the meal much better. Most carnitas that I have had elsewhere have been very juicy and tender, but not this one. It had a nice flavor but was just too dry. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas and it was not what one would expect. It was just a side of shrimp with onions on a plate with some sides and crispy tortillas. It was not served in a hot dish as has always been my experience, but on a normal plate and was again on the dry side. The shrimp was over cooked. We each had a margarita with our meal, which were good - on the tart side, just how I like them. They did not have much alcohol in them, but were very tasty. So, we each had a drink and a main dish, and our bill was $40. Seems high for this type of food in this type of a setting. While nothing was bad, except the heat - I probably won't be back as there is much better Mexican food to be had in Oxnard - at the same, or better pricing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-09-28T22:34:52-0400", "location_id": "3378471", "id": "423388444", "user": {"username": "oxnarddragonlady", "user_location": {"name": "Oxnard, California", "id": "32837"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Downtown Mazatlan!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32837-d3378471-r377734772-m11068-Sabor-Oxnard_California.html#review377734772", "text": "Really, for those looking for a Mexican Beach experience (without the surf close by) this does it-Diego Rivera type of furniture, bright, super staff-oh, yeah, the food; it's really very good.

Rosa told me it was the best fish taco she and Will had on their entire trip.  This summer traipsing around California with my younger daughter searching for college options we stopped at Sabor last Tuesday en-route to UCSB up the coast a bit from Oxnard.  This place sits a bit off the main streets but is quite inviting with its whale mural on the exterior wall with its big lettered name.

I had to test the proverbial fish taco waters to enjoy for myself a \"so-called best Fish Taco\" claim put forward by Rosa.  Well, that girl not only got her mother's beauty, wit and charm but also her exemplary taste buds, too. The 2 fish taco plates we were served, had re-fried pinto beans and rice, and came with four corn tortillas each. Smart service idea that, since this allowed both Lily and I to have four nice full, golden fried fish tacos with lettuce.  The sauce served with the tacos was delicious.  The meal was outstanding, the cost of $18.11 quite fair as it included a \"Pacifico\" beer in a 12 oz bottle and a large Sierra Mist (16 oz).  Our proffer of a tip to the counter gal was politely refused, with a smile and a soft \"no thank you\".  Delightful, tasty and very memorable.  It is an extraordinarily good fish taco.
