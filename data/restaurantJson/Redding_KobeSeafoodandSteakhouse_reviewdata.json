Unfortunately, I was not that impressed. The wait staff were very attentive, took the drink order quickly, then the meal order as well. The meal started with a broth/soup with a few slivers of mushroom (Japanese style for sure), followed by a decent small salad. They wash the lettuce well but fail to rinse it well. So it was a bit watered down. Didn't help that the dressing, as a result, thinned too much. Our cook, won't mention his name, came with the prepped dinner on his cart. Fried rice was his first part of the main meal.  Darned near tasteless. Then he started on the meats and seafood. He was serving two families. The vegetables, shrimp, steak and chicken all on grill at once, which was OK. My wife ordered steak and shrimp, grandson ordered shrimp, I ordered a chicken dish. My wife enjoyed her meal. My chicken had a strange taste thought it was a marinade or something floral. I did not eat but a couple bites. Had an upset stomach that my tums did not help.

We sat on the teppanyaki side where you sit around a grill in a group of 8 and watch your dinner being cooked by a chef.  They are very funny and do a good job cooking.  We both had New York steak and shrimp, soup, rice and veggies.  We were so full when we left.  Other than having to wait because they were running late it was great.  This was our second time eating here and will go back again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-17T17:56:40-0500", "location_id": "2319446", "id": "348711951", "user": {"username": "Maria K", "user_location": {"name": "Red Bluff, California, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "Definitely different with a show", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32952-d2319446-r332037588-m11068-Kobe_Seafood_and_Steakhouse-Redding_California.html#review332037588", "text": "Been there 4 times, first two times was excellent. third time they forgot my son's entire dinner.
