It's statue that--so the Korean story goes--honors the \"comfort women\" forced into Japanese military brothels during the period 1930-1945.  It's a story that--so the Japanese story goes, is an insult and a lie.   It's located in Glendale California, which is the city  with the second  largest Armenian population in the world.  Yerevan, the capitol of Armenia is the first.\n\nWhile Glendale (44% Armenian) has a  much smaller Korean population, it's not the largest center of Korean Americans in Los Angeles.  So I'm a little puzzled as to whythis particular statue wound up being situated in Glendale.  While I was puzzled, the Japanese American community---and the Japanese government were \"outraged\".  Lawsuits were filed seeking to remove the statue--the lawsuits were unsuccessful.  \n\nThe statue remains in the park, and is sort of a pilgrimage site for Korean families.  They come and bring flowers to the statue.  It is a piece of political art, and it is very well done.  The plaque beside the statue explains the significance of each piece of the sculpture--it's a group of two chairs--one empty, one with a small woman on the other. There's a bird on her shoulder, her hands are held just so, and her feet are bare. The symbolism is explicit--and explained.  Living in Glendale, I drive by the park and the statue two or three times a week. There are always fresh flowers there.  It is as powerful emotional symbol about a wrong done many many years ago.
