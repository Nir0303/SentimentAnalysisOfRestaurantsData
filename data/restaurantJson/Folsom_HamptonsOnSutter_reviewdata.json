Place was busy, we were told a 15 minute wait for outside seating.  35 minutes later, were shown to a table....inside.  With barstools as \"chairs\"-no backs.  We stated we had requested outdoor seating.  Apologies made, but they wouldn't tell us how long it would be for an outside table.  Really? Just take a guess, guys, it's very frustrating waiting longer than told, then not given seating preference.  Other server came and said table had opened up outside.  We were led to a back corner, where a disgusting (as in filthy/broken) table with a broken umbrella pole  (minus the umbrella) lay across it.  We actually looked at them and said, \"are you kidding? \".  So back inside we went.  Noise level was so ridiculously loud, server suggested we open window at our table to maybe help minimize the noise. She opened the window and left, only to return one minute later telling us manager had told her to close the window due to air conditioner running.  O.k., so placed order.  Fried calamari was bland, when on previous visit had been outstanding.  The steak sandwich had way too much grizzle and was too tough.  C'mon, charge a little extra and serve a better cut of meat.  Husband's burger was good.  Server was good with one exception-she kept pushing the dessert and telling us they were so big they were meant to be shared-well, we ordered one chocolate cake and were presented with a cupcake-no icing, just chocolate and caramel sauced drizzled on top.  AND 3 SPOONS.  Dessert alert-go to Cheesecake factory if you want to share a chocolate cake, and it will cost less. Overall, such a bad experience, we won't return.  Better and quieter restaurants in Folsom with MUCH better service.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-05-04T10:30:27-0400", "location_id": "3724657", "id": "204003381", "user": {"username": "shellgirl9", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": null, "title": "Not Impressed", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32389-d3724657-r199282087-m11068-Hampton_s_On_Sutter-Folsom_California.html#review199282087", "text": "We stopped here on a Sunday morning because there was a sandwich board outside promoting breakfast.
