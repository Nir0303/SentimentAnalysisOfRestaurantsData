Parking in the back is easier and means you get to walk through the BBQ smoker aroma to wake up your taste buds.  Order at the counter, food will be brought to your table. Decor could use some personality, but the food is tasty, fresh and filling.  I have brought half of my sandwich home (tri-tip, steak sandwich, Big Vinnie) all 3 times.
