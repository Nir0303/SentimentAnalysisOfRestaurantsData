Very nice setting, a few shady spots (would be nice if the viewing areas were shady). Some courts are soooo big that shagging balls is an effort that eats into your playing time. \nI played in the daytime where the sun was a blinding problem. If only Arizona was a little less sunny! I think playing at night is the way to go (the lighting capacity is appropriate). It was a great setting for a tournament.\n\nAs a player, I found the daytime brightness and the size of some of the courts made play difficult.

There is a pro shop playing the Tennis Channel and selling tennis items as well as popsicles (I got the coconut one, and it was very sweet tasting) and a few chocolate concept ice creams -- nothing out of the ordinary. I actually managed to fall onto my hands out by the parking lot, and the tournament first aid station was not able to do much other than dab a little antibiotic cream (which I had to ask for) and wrap a gauze around the scrape. Luckily, our hotel had some disinfectant, and we were given directions to the nearby CVS to buy our own first aid items, including band-aids. These courts are all outdoors, and it rained a few times while I was there, play being discontinued as deemed necessary. There is one 'stadium court,' and there was always a doubles match in progress there. There is a grassy lot in the back of the complex where we had our players' party.
