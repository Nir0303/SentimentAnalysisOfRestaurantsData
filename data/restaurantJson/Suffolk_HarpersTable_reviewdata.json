That was followed by a tasty cauliflower soup (who knew cauliflower could be so delicious!) and a deconstructed chicken pot pie.   We both had the pork tenderloin with chile mac and cheese and it was the best pork tenderloin I have ever had.  The flavor and texture were incredible.  For dessert, I had the corn pudding and my husband had the neopolitan ice cream sundae.  Both were the perfect ending to an incredible meal.  The only time I have had a meal this outstanding was in Manhattan.  The restaurant has a pleasant vibe and our waitress was friendly and was happy to explain our choices. The owner came by our table twice to make sure that we had everything we needed and that our meal was to our satisfaction.  My husband and I commented that even the music was the perfect choice for the background. I can't wait to come back again because I understand the menu changes frequently to reflect what is fresh, in keeping with their farm to table philosophy.

The chef creatives dishes that are locally sourced.\nOur party enjoyed the hushpuppies and olives for the app. There were a variety of main dishes which all parties' said were excellent. Our servers were very attentive keeping our glasses full. Their house-made ice cream is excellent with my favorite being the raspberry sorbet.\n ", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-05-21T13:28:37-0400", "location_id": "3371574", "id": "375219152", "user": {"username": "Pam C", "user_location": {"name": "Suffolk, Virginia", "id": "58224"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Great Dishes with Southern Flair!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58224-d3371574-r368796515-m11068-Harper_s_Table-Suffolk_Virginia.html#review368796515", "text": "We are always pleasantly pleased with the dishes we have at Harper's Table. This time we went to a wine tasting at the restaurant where they featured Michael Shaps' wines. What a treat! We also had a dish that was prepared from the James Beard House recently. Beets, pistachio, first softshell crabs, ravioli, duck and strawberry tart all were especially prepared in their own right with a specific wine pairing. A very special evening! All of Harper's dishes are incredible! The staff is also very friendly.

Cornbread was room temperature and came out with our meal rather than before. Not sure if this is normal, but the bread was still good. I feel like it would have been better warm. The cocktail list was a mix of a few staples and some interesting concoctions. My wife had a sidecar, and I had dead reviver or something like that. Both cocktails were alright - not particularly strong, but not terribly flavorful either. For entr\u00e9es, my wife had shrimp & grits with andouille sausage. The sausage was quite strong, but it didn't ruin the dish. It did give the shrimp a smokey flavor. My pork schnitzel was kind of bland, as was the cabbage on which it rested. I appreciate that it's a unique take on a German staple, but the only German-ish flavor to be found was the tasty potato bits mingled in with the cabbage. The place itself is nice, the staff was friendly and helpful. We sat in the back room which has a bunch of AC registers. It's almost impossible not to sit under one, so plan ahead if you get cold easily! Fortunately, we were the first people in the room, and I think they turned the AC off for my wife.\n\nI would give this more than 3, but less than 4 (3.75?). Better than average, but less than I expected. 2 drinks, 2 biscuits and 2 entrees came to $90.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-27T11:43:43-0400", "location_id": "3371574", "id": "368235233", "user": {"username": "Doophy", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
