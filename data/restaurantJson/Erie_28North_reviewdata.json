I had been excused for lunch from Jury Duty and I stopped in. Atmosphere is ok, a little dim. Waitress was pleasant and brought a menu  right away. I ordered the side salad and the Bourbon Poutine. Let me say, I am a poutine Nazi, as I am married to a French Canadian and we fix it all the time at home. My side salad came relatively quick, a little disappointing, no frills. Just lettuce with 2 tiny cherry tomatoes and  a side of ranch. Finished that  and had to wait quite a while for the rest of my meal. While the picture may make it look good - it wasn't.  First and foremost - NEVER serve food that is burned, which several of my fries obviously were. To a crisp. Black. Second, Poutine is supposed to be a ooyee gooee cheesy concoction with gravy and fries. I had literally 6 cheese curds on it, not melted but hard as a rock, burned too. It gets better! The \"duck\" on it was shredded.... horribly dried out and hard. Obviously this dish sat under a broiler, which is not how poutine is prepared. Another resturant down the street introduced poutine to Erie, I know this because my husband is the one who introduced that resturants owner to it.

The dark hardwood flooring is new, but other than that, it looks the same minus a few new wall decorations.  We came on a Monday night for happy hour and it was very quiet.  The bartender was also the server for the restaurant.  \n    The happy hour wine menu was great - $5 for pretty much any wine on their list.  The pours were from a wine draft and were VERY generous.  They carry Apothic red (which goes with everything!).  \n    We had several items off the menu, starting with the veggie flatbread.  The veggies were nice and crisp, but a bit too heavy for the slightly soft flatbread.  Eating required a hand underneath to make sure nothing fell off.  Next, we had bbq shrimp spread over a bed of risotto.  This was excellent.  The shrimp were plentiful and the risotto flavorful.  This could have been an entr\u00e9e and we highly recommend it.\n   Next up, we split an apple walnut salad.  We had the maple cider dressing on the side and requested a gorgonzola dressing on the side too.  We mixed a little of each together on the salad and a little went a long way.  We used maybe 15% of each dressing bowl on the salad.  The mix was fantastic and it cut the sweetness of the cider very well.  Portion size wasn't huge, but it was enough to split as a light appetizer.  Overall value wasn't great on this dish ($10), but tasty nonetheless.\n    For dinner, I had the stockyard strip, ordered medium rare.  It came with a huge portion of grilled brussel sprouts and an equally big portion of sliced seasoned potatoes.  The steak was undercooked, mostly rare.  Very disappointing.  The potatoes were tasty and the sprouts were pretty good (I don't have much of a basis for comparison as I don't recall ever eating sprouts in my adult life).  Overall though, the steak had some hard fat lining the side that was inedible, coupled with it being undercooked, I would not order again.\n   My wife's entr\u00e9e, the surf and turf kabob was fantastic!  The portion size was very big and blended beef and shrimp on kabob skewers on a bed of what I think was risotto and rice.  She loved it.  I sampled it and it was excellent.  \n    So, overall the bbq shrimp skewers and the surf and turf kabobs were the highlights of our date night.  \n  As for service - our female server/bartender was very personable and attentive.  She also was not overbearing, giving us plenty of time to just sit and talk as we were there for several hours.\n  We dined with the fine dining card and would recommend going to 28 North.

We sat in a high table in main dining/bar area. They also have a separate \"club\" with a stage and private party room. (More on that later). Our server was so friendly and attentive to our needs. I ordered the crispy fish tacos. Very yummy and also will say had a good bite with the spices added. I love it! Now back to the club....This spot takes into account a separate clientele that prefers to enjoy good music and dance with some legal adult beverages. The band sounded great and the way the space is separate with glass doors is efficient and takes into consideration the diners may want peace and quiet for their dining. Good job 28 North this town needs more local restaurants.
