I always recommend visits to the Catholic Churches for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Often much of the history and architectural riches of a region rest within the Church building. If you plan to attend Mass make sure you check specifically for Cathedral times since this is part of a five-parish grouping (Saturday Vigil is at 4 pm. Sunday Masses are at 8, 10, 12 (Latin) and 5). For non-Catholics, please be mindful of those there to worship.\n\nThis is a magnificent building and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The style is considered neo-Gothic and the largely white interior reminds me of many other colonial buildings. It is also considered to be the tallest structure in Portland. This is definitely a historic site, if that's what you're seeking. Once you're done looking at the Cathedral you can check out the Eastern Cemetery across the street for another historical site.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-05T13:07:57-0400", "location_id": "10769618", "id": "434890932", "user": {"username": "John S", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": "28926"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Imposing sight", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g40827-d10769618-r410551324-m11068-The_Cathedral_Of_The_Immaculate_Conception-Portland_Maine.html#review410551324", "text": "From a distance, you can see this imposing church on a hilltop.
