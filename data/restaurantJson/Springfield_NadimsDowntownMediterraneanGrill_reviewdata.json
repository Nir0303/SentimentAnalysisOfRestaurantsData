Expect to pay quite a bit more than you may be used to in Springfield for your meal, however. On this last lunch visit, two salads with shrimp and an order of grape leaves was $42 before tip.

We had been there for both lunch and for supper.\n  On March 3, we went for supper, and it was our first disappointment.\n  It was far too noisy.  We couldn't hear each other talk for all the noise, especially from the bar, which was about 15 feet away.  The couple next to us complained to a server that they couldn't hear their child talk for all the noise.  The place is always noisy, and the owners appear to have chosen the visibility of bare windows and shiny floor to the sound absorption of curtains and carpets, but this time it was much worse.  Bad enough that it detracted from our experience.\n  We both ordered lamb.  My wife asked me to taste her kebab because she thought she had been given beef instead.  I agreed.  The server assured us we had both received lamb.  She said she could tell from the skewer on the kebabs.  My lamb steak, like my wife's kebab, had no distinctive flavor of lamb.  It was just another piece of red meat.  Many Americans don't like lamb, but those of us who do and who order it want it to taste like lamb.  I expect the lamb Nadim's is using comes from feedlot lambs rather than pasture-grown lambs.  Put any critter on a feedlot and feed it corn and it will taste like feedlot beef.  Grass-fed lamb's taste is much more distinctive.  And flavorful.  \n  All the side dishes were excellent.\n  We will no doubt stop at Nadim's again, if we are in Springfield at lunch time.  But at supper, it is just too noisy.  And, we will be more selective in what we order and avoid lamb, although richly flavored lamb is a major reason to eat at a Mediterranean restaurant.  \n  Bob Neal\n  New Sharon, Maine", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Nadim K, Owner at Nadim\u2019s Downtown Mediterranean Grill, responded to this review", "text": "Lamb is definitely a reason people go to a Mediterranean restaurant, Bob, I won't argue you with you there.
