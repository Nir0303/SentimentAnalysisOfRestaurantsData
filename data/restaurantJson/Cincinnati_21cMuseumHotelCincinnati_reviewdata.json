A lack of a doorman/bellman left us, after a long journey, to fight with two sets of heavy doors and a number of suitcases since we were also transporting work materials. Reaching the front desk, we were greeted by very energetic, yet moderately clueless millennials who gave us a key but neglected to even tell us where the elevators were (behind the gallery door in a hallway), never mind assist us to our room. \n\nWe arrived on the room floor, found our room, which was a ridiculously overpriced version of a junior suite. \n\nThe sparse furnishings were sort of hip, as we expected,  but not as functional as they could have been, very far from the luxury status the price of the room warranted. \n\nNo one knew where the safe was, the towels and were insufficient, the lighting insufficient, the tiniest bathroom rugs which did virtually nothing but supply us with something to trip over! Terrible shower head with little water pressure. Sunken bathtub had no safety features whatsoever and no working drain. Maelin and Goetz toiletries best part of room, yet only one bar of soap for two people... With bathtub shower and two sinks!\n\nWe ate brunch downstairs, which was good, but it took a lot to get this staff on point. Example....Three reminders to bring tea and we were the only ones there. Be prepared to wait. A lot. Then hope for the best.. If they remember you!\n\nWe felt like everyone in the hotel was stoned. The elevators stunk of pot the whole stay. It was a very expensive, very strange stay. I would highly recommend going around the corner and staying, instead at a less hip, yet highly efficient hotel with a well trained staff. This hotel should've paid us to stay there! Too bad, as the concept was good, but it seemed like a trust fund hipster's folly. Not a way to run a first class hotel!

We were in town for the final Reds/Cubs game of the season.  We basically chose this hotel for the location.  However, we didn't expect to enjoy it as much as we did.

We felt in good hands.  \n\nWe wound up getting an upgrade to a luxury suite.  It's a shame we were only there one night.  The decor was great.  Quite fitting for a modern art museum hotel.  The shower was incredible. It has to be the size of my living room.  The towels were luxuriously large and thick.  The double sink made us feel at home.  Bed was super comfortable.  Bottles of water were provided.  It was everything a hotel should be.\n\nWe explored the art museum when we arrived back at the hotel after the game and some dinner.  Then we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail which was wonderful.  We were a little bummed that the rooftop lounge was closed on Sunday.  However, we still managed to enjoy ourselves.\n\nI should probably ding a star off due to the loud street traffic in the morning...we stayed on the third floor.  However, the overall experience was so wonderful I have to overlook that.  The front desk gentleman told us they were putting sound proof windows (or something) up eventually.
