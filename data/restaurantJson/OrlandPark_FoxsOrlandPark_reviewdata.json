When we received our bill, we showed our waitress the golf ball and she said okay I will be right back with your bill.  When she returned she said that unfortunately the promotion is only good Sunday through Thursday evening.  We challenged her and asked her to please ask her manager because we have never ever had this problem before.  The manager returned to our table and said he had only been working there 3 months but that was the policy and there was nothing he could do.  Needless to say, we were ALL disappointed.  We felt that he should have at least honored it the one-time and then in the future we would know about the new restrictions.  After we had paid our bill, sometime later, the director of operations, Jacqueline, came to our table and apologized and said she would fix our bill but we had already paid.  I'm not sure that we will be returning.  It's unfortunate because last year we dined their quite often but this incident has left a bad \"taste\" in our mouths.
