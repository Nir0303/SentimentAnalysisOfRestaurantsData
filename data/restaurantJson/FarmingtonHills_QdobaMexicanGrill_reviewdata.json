When one is buying three TINY tacos for 9.00, one really should have just gotten Taco Bell. It's no worse. My older son had gotten nachos and when we got them home, we found there were no nacho chips in the bag.\nMy younger son had gotten three chicken tacos and I got three vegetarian tacos and she threw them all in he bag together with no label and then proceeded to get sauce over the top of the bag which my husband had to get napkins for before he could pick it up.

I recommend the steak; my husband likes the chicken.  Also consider the \"pick two\" lunch option: for a set price (6.99), you can order two items from among several, including quesadillas, soup, taco salad, tacos, etc.\n\nThe warmed Queso cheese sauce is amazing; a little pricey, but great for dipping chips into, or for slathering onto other dishes.  I'm not too keen on the selections for salsa: if you are fussy about salsa, ask for a taste if you are not familiar with their selections.\n\nAlso, if you frequent Qdoba locations, be sure to sign up for their Q card, which you present at every purcase -- I think you get a free entree for every$50 you buy -- enough that it is worth it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-11-21T16:07:41-0500", "location_id": "3571939", "id": "145932222", "user": {"username": "HTOTMO", "user_location": {"name": "Southfield, Michigan", "id": "42721"}}}]}
