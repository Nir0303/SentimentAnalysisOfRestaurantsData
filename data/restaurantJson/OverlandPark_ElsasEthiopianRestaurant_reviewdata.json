It was some time before he cleared the table.   My friend ordered a honey wine.  When we asked for a straw we were flatly told this was not the right way.   The couple next to us asked for a fork and they were told this was not the right way to eat the food.     By now we all learned this was a cultural thing.  The server took great pride in his food and the culture.  He explained how to eat the food using the soft flat bread to pick up the food and dip it in the homemade cheese.      My advice is you decide to go is roll with things don't try to change or adapt to it what your used to.  The server  seems honored if you ask for explanation or recommendation.  In this night the wait was long but worth it.  The honey wine was different and some will like it and all should try.  All the food is tasty and filling and the experience is unique.

I don't really know what to make of it. I do like the flavors and textures. We shared the combo platter as Elsa recommended. The injera is their potatoes or rice. It's similar to a pancake. It has a neutral taste but nice texture. As Elsa said- you have to dunk it over the beef or chicken or lentil and scoop then put in your mouth. You use your fingers to eat which I am not new to. The beef is spicy and savory. The chicken, lentils and sambosa are all good.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-10-23T08:27:07-0400", "location_id": "2414029", "id": "235898431", "user": {"username": "uberkyut", "user_location": {"name": "Kansas City, Missouri", "id": "44535"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Love the food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38969-d2414029-r229215284-m11068-Elsa_s_Ethiopian_Restaurant-Overland_Park_Kansas.html#review229215284", "text": "We love going to the farmers market on Saturday and then stopping by Elsa's for lunch.
