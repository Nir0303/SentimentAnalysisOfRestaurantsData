There were a couple of people seated at the bar and two to three other groups of people seated for a meal.\nWe were waited on quickly both for our drink and dinner options. We ordered the chips and queso appetizer and I ordered the Jayhawker Sandwich, Matt ordered the McQuinton. \nThe Queso was very good, way better than the Espinaca Queso we had just the night before at Mi Ranchito! It had just enough of a kick to it...but not enough to burn your face off. The Jayhawker sandwich had a very unique Spicy honey mustard dressing and was so good! Matt enjoyed his McQuinton sandwich as well. We shared the queso and were able to take home half our sandwiches as leftovers.\nThe food was yummy and we look forward to coming back someday to try some of the bread bowl soups!\nThe atmosphere was more than a little confusing... The bar was really cool ....red and blue lighted for KU...well stocked. The building is old and has the typical stone walls you see in many of the downtown Mass St. buildings which of course has stand alone charm and appeal ...however...most of the seating in this restaurant is ripped up, badly. The food makes you feel like you are in a delicatessen, the bar makes you feel like you are in a hispter joint and the shredded seating everywhere makes you feel like you are in a college students dorm room or apartment after a particularly wild party.\nFixing the seating here should be relatively easy and fairly inexpensive and it would make the place look so much nicer.\nThe only other complaint we have is our waitress...Matt's drink ran dry. And though we asked for a box, (stop one) then she brought us a box and our ticket, (stop two)....she never asked him would he like a refill.\nThis unfortunately, is typical of service in Lawrence we have found. A big deduction for points in service as we believe we should never have to ask for a refill...especially in a bar!\nThat being said, we really enjoyed the meal and look forward to coming back sometime.\nWe definitely recommend this place for lunch or an EARLY dinner as we can see this is a college bar hangout later in the evening.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-03T17:14:04-0500", "location_id": "390649", "id": "247281844", "user": {"username": "Wanderfish7172", "user_location": {"name": "Lawrence, Kansas", "id": "38836"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Same as it was in 2002", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38836-d390649-r243914469-m11068-Quinton_s_Bar_Deli-Lawrence_Kansas.html#review243914469", "text": "I went to The University of Kansas from 97-2002 and Quinton's was always one of my favorites.
