He raved about their phenomenal breakfast.  Our first attempt to eat at JJ's was for breakfast, but we learned that they didn't open until 10:30.  They had stopped serving breakfast except for a brunch on Saturday.  So, the second time we stopped, we made sure we were there at 10:30.  I had the veggie wrap. It had the usual veggies along with some less usual ones like cauliflower.  The balsamic dressing made it very tasty.  My husband had a porkstrami sandwich with red cabbage.  He raved about it.  One week later we were back again and we live 50 miles away!  This time it was Taco Tuesday.  I had the pork with green salsa and my husband had the chicken burrito.  They were both delicious.  We saw large colorful salads being served, so I asked the waitress what that was.  It was their quinoa salad.  Then we saw their soups go by.  We already can't wait to go back and try some of that!  Presentation was superb and they have really neat desserts, too.  We got two of the individually wrapped soft chocolate chip cookies - the perfect finish for only 35 cents each!\n\nTo summarize, I would say that JJ's menu is far from \"run of the mill\" but is unique with classy presentation, yet it is not reflected in the price.  It is very reasonable.  It also appears that they do a lot of take out orders.
