Besides the proximity to our home, the very reasonable prices, and the friendly staff, there is the food.  I have not had a single item that I have not liked and our latest trip there was no exception.  \n\nMy wife got her usual enchiladas but like always she asks for substitutions.  It came out perfect and there was not an upcharge for the change.  I ordered the bistek with peppers, onions, and cheese.  In short, it was incredible.  I often get the bistek with the red sauce but after tasting the salsa, I decided that I did not want to kill my taste buds with excessive heat.  A great decision since the dinner had a touch of heat but a small enough amount that my wife who does not like spicy food stole several pieces of meat off my plate.  Along with the bistek were the sides of roasted potatoes, homemade refried beans, Spanish rice, and a small salad.  The rice is merely fair but the beans were very good as were the potatoes.  What really surprised me was the salad.  It was basically a small serving of lettuce but they served a small amount of pico on it and a nice scoop of guacamole.  I immediately took the chopped peppers off the salad but without them, the salad was very good.  It had a hint of lime from the pico as well as the onions and tomato combination.  The guac was definitely fresh.  There were chunks of avocado in it.\n\nI don't think I have had a bad item here and have had several items that are exceptional.  It starts with the chips (thicker and more solid than you get at most places) and a very good (hot!) salsa and goes from there to the rest of the meal.  Two notes.  First, they do not have Coke products, just Pepsi.  Second, on Friday nights they have live music which can get quite loud.\n\nThe enchiladas were less than $9, the bistek was $14.  We got out for less than $36 including the tip.  And if we were not as hungry as we were (and we did make pigs of ourselves) there would have been leftovers to take home with us.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual but the food is anything but.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-30T18:44:07-0400", "location_id": "2445146", "id": "305157863", "user": {"username": "Neal B", "user_location": {"name": "Rowlett, Texas", "id": "56587"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "I'd go back", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56587-d2445146-r301779335-m11068-Amelia_s_Cocina_Mexicana-Rowlett_Texas.html#review301779335", "text": "Great food!!

Delicious (I was wiping off the plate for the last little bits) but it was almost borderline too hot for my taste.

There is an upcharge of $2 to add refried beans to it, but even so, it is still less than $10.  I had a bite of the shell that serves as a bowl to hold it.

Four four restaurants so close together, all are more than acceptable entries in the \"where should we eat out tonight\" contest in Rowlett.\n\nThis was our first trip to Amelia's after seeing it for quite a while.  We had been told it was an upscale, somewhat expensive restaurant by friends so we had been putting it off.  A mistake.  Prices are actually quite reasonable with most of the entrees in the $10.00 range or a little bit less whcih puts it middle of the road for prices.\n\nFood.  My wife and I started off with a guacamole appetizer.  Three scoops of quac served over a bed of lettuce and tomatoes with a bit of cheese added.  Not as spicy as some of the guac I have had but definitely freshly made.  I would give it a good to very good.\n\nThe chips were interesting.  Much thicker than most of the local restaurants served.  Different but not bad.  Two of us finished off the better part of a basket of them.  The chips came with salsa which I liked.  It was a bit hotter than what most restaurants serve but not exceedingly so.  Great flavor.  My wife thought it was a bit too hot for her taste.\n\nThe menu is a collection of basic Tex-Mex recipes with a few interesting additions thrown in to the mix like a steak covered with cheese and onions.  I was seriously tempted to try it but it had a \"hot\" indicator by it so I chickened out despite the waiter saying that it was about the same degree of heat as in the salsa.\n\nMy wife had the cheese enchiladas with a red sauce, her judge of good Tex-Mex.  She really liked it.  I ordered the combo plate of an enchilada, gordito, and taco.  One nice thing about Amelias is the variety.  There is a white sauce, a red sauce, and a queso.  But what was really interesting were the choices of filling.  Besides the usual ground beef and chicken, there are green pepper and egg, beans, cheese, cactus, beef fajita, chicken fajita, brisket,  spicy pork, barbacoa, Guiso de Puerco Bisteck (can't remember what that one was), and Papas con Chorizo.  I decided to try for variety with the chicken enchilada with white sauce, the beef brisket taco, and the steak fajita gordito.  The chicken enchilada was stuffed with chicken but the sauce was very bland and thin.  I would give that a fair.  The steak gordito was more of a street taco, well done meat filling a pocket taco.  Lots of flavor.  It was what I would call a classic street taco.  Very good.  The real gem was the taco.  It was a soft flour taco stuffed with a ton of shredded, very juicy meat.  Flavor was very mild but when I added the lettuce, tomato, and pico that was served on the side, it was delicious.\n\nWe got there a bit before the crowd showed up getting there about 6 PM on a Saturday.  By 6:45 the restaurant was packed with every table but one filled.  That might account for the service.  It started off exemplary but by the time we were getting ready to leave, we could tell the servers were a bit rushed.  Still, our server was very personable and gave us several suggestions and comments about the menu.\n\nOverall, a good eating experience and a place we will return to, in part because it is right around the corner from us.  And I do want to try that steak.\n\nOne suggestion, the first two tables near the door are a bit drafty when the door is opened.  I would suggest sitting back a bit- especially in the winter.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-17T18:45:03-0500", "location_id": "2445146", "id": "249788984", "user": {"username": "Neal B", "user_location": {"name": "Rowlett, Texas", "id": "56587"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Tasty Mexican Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56587-d2445146-r242588384-m11068-Amelia_s_Cocina_Mexicana-Rowlett_Texas.html#review242588384", "text": "We have been to Amelia's Cocina for dinner many times and never been disappointed.  We love the salsa.  The chips are made from corn, not flour as another reviewer mentioned, but they are a thicker, crunchy chip.  We still enjoyed them! The atmosphere is pleasant with Latin music in the background, unless you happen to go on a weekend evening, when they have had an Elvis impersonator singing.  I prefer Latin music in a Mexican restaurant.  I would be pleased if they made the restaurant brighter by opening some blinds or adding a little more light.  The service there is always friendly and good.  I also WISH they would open up the floor for some Latin dancing on weekends!\nMy husband enjoys the Bistek Flameado, although the fried potatoes that come with it are a bit greasy.  The rice and beans are good.  Guacamole is fresh and delicious! I've gotten the Pechuga Mexicana, or Mexican chicken breast many times, and since I don't care for beans, I ask for their Nopales, or cactus which is cooked in a spicy tomato sauce.  Yummy! A plus, they have not charged for substitution.  I'd love to see fresh made flour and corn tortillas.  It is confusing that they have a tortilleria in Garland, yet their tortillas here in Rowlett do not seem that fresh.  (I get fresh tortillas all the time from Central Market and they are MUCH better.) Really fresh tortillas, add a little light, and keep the Latin music, that would give them that 5 star rating!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-12-02T13:32:35-0500", "location_id": "2445146", "id": "242588384", "user": {"username": "IslandGirl615", "user_location": {"name": "Rowlett, Texas", "id": "56587"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Excellent Service and Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56587-d2445146-r233206208-m11068-Amelia_s_Cocina_Mexicana-Rowlett_Texas.html#review233206208", "text": "The service is great at this small restaurant in the Dallas hamlet of Rowlett.
