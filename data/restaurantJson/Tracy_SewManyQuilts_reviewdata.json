Located in the Historic Downtown Tracy district it's a great location.\nAt first I thought it was a tiny store until Tony gave me a personal tour. Their fabrics are separated in to rooms (almost like being in a house). It is beautifully organized. Easy to find what you are looking for when you need it. In the back they have a large class room. Tony told me on Friday nights they have a knitting circle meet there as the local knit shop closed. \nTony was amazingly friendly and wonderfully knowledgeable. I had a great time and bought some fabrics I had never seen before.\nMake this a stop on your next quilt run!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2011-09-30T09:52:05-0400", "location_id": "2305445", "id": "118787483", "user": {"username": "KSparrow", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}]}
