Upon entering the bubbly staff greets you as if they know you and one immediately feels as if they were in the Middle East. The hookah's that one will smoke there are very tasty and the entire experience is extremely authentic. Overall a great place to go if you want a laid back night and you will soon realize that you could be there alone or with a large group and will be content with either.
