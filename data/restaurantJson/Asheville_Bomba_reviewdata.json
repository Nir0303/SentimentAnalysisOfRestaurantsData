I mean the place is literally a tiny place in the corner of two main streets very very tight. But the food oh my, Arepas are an absolute most. And sunny farm 44 tacos are also a must. Don't leave without trying the Arepas you won't regret it I promise. I love how the this pace infuses South and Central American flavors to bring about quite an experience. \n\nBon appetite!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-10-04T09:33:13-0400", "location_id": "3649033", "id": "316080527", "user": {"username": "javilv", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Great coffee in the center of it all", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60742-d3649033-r314943299-m11068-Bomba-Asheville_North_Carolina.html#review314943299", "text": "We stopped in for coffee in the late evening after walking around downtown for a while.

The place was empty except for us on a weeknight, and the patio is right on the corner of Patton and Biltmore across from the Vance monument, so there are street performers and people passing by.
