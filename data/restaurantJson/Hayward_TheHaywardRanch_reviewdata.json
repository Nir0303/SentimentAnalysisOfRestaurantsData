The Bar had the charm of what it pertains to be - a homely ranch setting! However, when a restaurant shows signs of neglect one wonders what the state of the kitchens might be!!! That detracts from the food! I hope the owners take this kindly advice and consider a 'makeover'", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-26T07:33:34-0400", "location_id": "2660497", "id": "283138278", "user": {"username": "fentumew", "user_location": {"name": "Union City, California", "id": "33204"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Long time establishment", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32480-d2660497-r263791284-m11068-The_Hayward_Ranch-Hayward_California.html#review263791284", "text": "I've seen the Hayward Ranch all my life and never had a chance to eat there. Finally stopped for dinner with a friend. They served up a GREAT Manhattan to start things off. The New York steak I had was ok but nothing special. It was served with corn that was a little on the tough side. The baked potato was good and the waiter brought butter for it right away. He asked if I wanted sour cream and bacon and I said yes. It was about 15 minutes later before I got the sour cream....? Not sure want happened with that as they weren't very busy. All in all it was ok.

Ate at 11 but were in the mood for breakfast. Three selections: the Hayward Omelet with country potatoes, the East Bay omelet with shrimp and avocado, and pork chops with three sunny side up eggs and country potatoes.  Selection of breads was on top of that.  Served in a funky Western decor restaurant with an attached and active bar- it was tempting to consider a mimosa or Bloody Mary.  Servings were so large I thought I reliving previous night's Man vs Food episode. Good coffee. Served hot as a breakfast should be, I didn't feel like it was left sitting up waiting for the waitress.  Attentive service.
