This bar may be in the central university district, but the crowd was diverse -- from grandparents to 40s to bridal parties. Of course by midnight it was the under 35 crowd, but no mind to us, who were ready to call it a night anyway. The piano players, who also played guitar & drums were stupendous musicians & singers. The quality of music was top notch. Unlike some piano bars we've been to, they played every one of our requests & we never paid more than $5/song. The venue is also fabulous. It's spacious with lots of seating, although to have a good view, get there before 8:30. The act is fun!  They bring the crowd into it nicely & encourage crowd/pleasing antics. Drinks are reasonable & non-smoking!  It's a little loud up front. Seems like best seats are on middle level along bar railing. We sat near stage & was fun too. You can reserve a table for $25, but catch is they'll only guarantee it until 8:30. I wouldn't sit right at the stage... too close for me. If you can't find parking, try the hotel around the corner. They only charged us $5.
