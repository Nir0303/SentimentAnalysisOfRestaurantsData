The next morning after getting ready to head to the funeral home I go to the front to get breakfast (at 9:01am).  There was a guy in there putting all the food up. He never said hello or anything to us. He didn't acknowledge that we was even in there. He just rushed to put away the muffins, fruit, waffles, cereal and milk.  The least he could have done was said that breakfast was over at 9. (Mind you we wasn't told when it ended when we checked in). We noticed the pool.  It was the WORST pool I have ever seen.  It doesn't look like it had been cleaned in a very long time. There was no way we was getting in that pool.  We have stayed in other La Quinta's before and always had a great experience.
