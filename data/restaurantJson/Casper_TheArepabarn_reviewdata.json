This is authentic Venezuelan cuisine and very tasty! Fried plantains are a side option with your order. Your meal starts out with a bowl of flavorful soup and an order of mini Arepas with dipping sauces. When you receive your meal you may think it is not much food but trust me, it is incredibly delicious and quite filling!

I went with a friend who loves it. I wasn't very impressed. The menu is not written in a way that made much sense to someone lacking in Venezualan terminology. It was in English, but I was left not really knowing what to order, so I went with the special, which was something Negro. Every question I had asked the server was answered with \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure.\" The meal came with a saucer with 8 little arepas (fried corn cakes about the size of a quarter). They were actually very tasty once I salted them, but if you want more it's another $2 for 8 quarter sized bland corn cakes. The meal also came with soup. There was about a quarter cup of soup that was 90% watery broth and 10% onions, mystery meat, and celery. At this point, I was thinking Venezualan food is just plan bland! My meal came and smelled very fragrant - there were two thin slices of marinated meat about the size of a playing card, an ice cream scoop of white rice, and a small pile of steamed vegetables that had the white on them that looks like they are dried out. My first bite of meat was cold. Not room temperature, cold like it just came out of the refrigerator. I asked my friend if it was supposed to be cold and she said no. We called the waitress over and she took it back and heated it, when she brought it back there was a long black hair on top of the scoop of rice. The meat had an excellent flavor, but was very dry. The rice was unflavored, as were the vegetables. It came with a fried plantain, which I had never tried before. It was the most flavorful part of the meal. The owner came over and spoke to us and apologized and offered a free meal, which I declined saying I was no longer hungry. He came back twice, insisting on giving me a free something to make up for it. I finally said ok and he gave me a sandwich that he said was the most popular item on the menu. I sent it with my SO in his lunch and he did not care for it at all. If you are gluten free, the entire restaurant is safe. I won't go back, because I don't like bland food or small portions for an expensive meal ($12+). If you like Venezuelan food, give it a try! I was assured by my friend and the owner that the service is usually better and they have never before been served cold food or food with hair in it. I am giving it three stars because of the owner....and because my friend says it wasn't a normal experience here - otherwise I would give it 1 star.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-10-23T09:26:05-0400", "location_id": "10524969", "id": "430929964", "user": {"username": "Robin S", "user_location": {"name": "Pigeon Forge, Tennessee", "id": "55270"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "An arupa South American restaurant in WY?
