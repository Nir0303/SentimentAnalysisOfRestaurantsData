I brought in my growler one day to get it filled, and was told that they only fill growlers that are sold at their store with their label on them. Not particularly pleased about having to buy a new growler, I did so anyways, and enjoyed the beer. \n\nToday I went back to get it filled again since I have friends coming over tonight to play cards. I went with my empty ACH growler and was told that they \"may be out of lids\". The cashier went to ask the manager sitting a few feet away, and returned saying she wasn't sure if they had any. I told her if they did that I would like Beer X. She proceeds to get my coffee made, and then fill up my growler, and returns without a lid and begins placing masking tape over the top (which is not sticking to the wet glass very well). I ask if they did not have lids, and she said \"no, but I will tape it for you\". I ask if that will be a problem driving around with it sloshing everywhere, and she recommended that I \"put it between your legs\" (nevermind the open container ticket I could get if I were to be pulled over!). I also tell her that it is lunchtime, and I have to return for work and was going to leave the growler in a cooler during the afternoon, and feel like it will be flat by tonight, and she replies \"you should keep your lids in the future\" and \"we are ghetto around here\". I have had growlers filled at many places, and each time a fresh lid has always been placed, as well as a plastic coating around the new lid that is heated so it seals it tight. I then had to take my taped growler to work and put in the refrigerator (talk about some weird looks from co-workers), and put a plastic bag around the top with rubber bands to try to seal it. The whole thing was absolutely ridiculous. I would have spoken to the manager if I didn't have to get back to work. Overall, I was made to feel at fault for not having an old lid.\n\nTheir coffee is decent (I always get the Red Eye -- 2 shots of espresso mixed with their house coffee), and their beer selection is nice, only if you enjoy your beer there and don't try to take it home. The atmosphere is very nice and chill, but the whole thing with the growlers is poorly managed, and should not be offered if they can't do it fairly and correctly.
