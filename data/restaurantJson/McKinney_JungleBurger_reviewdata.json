Normally if I don't like a place I simply will not go back.  I don't feel it's necessary to bash a place if I don't like it.\n\nHowever, I feel it's necessary to put a review on this place just out of concern of our 10 minute experience.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I decided to try Jungle Burger because of the reviews of having one of the \"Best\" burgers in McKinney. We walked in a right away the inside of the place wasn't all impressive. We stood waiting for somebody to seat us and just decided to seat ourselves. The first table we picked was dirty and in need of being wiped off. As we were looking a server met us. We sat at a different table and as we sat down we noticed a cricket sitting ON the table. The server didn't make any effort to remove the cricket, and it was up to my fianc\u00e9e to sweep it off the table.\n\nRight away that left me in a \"should we stay or go\" mindset. But we decided to stick it out as we told the server we'd take some waters. The server proceeded to tell us how when he comes in to work, he'll sweep a ton of crickets off the (front) windows. This got my mind to thinking if there are crickets on the window, where else do they go? The server left to get us our waters, brought them back and left so we could look at the menu. As we were looking I really was in the frame of mind to leave. My fianc\u00e9e then told me to turn around. I turned around and there was a cricket sitting on the top of the booth just shy of my shoulder. \n\nThat was our deciding factor to get up and leave. I don't know if the food here is good but I'm not willing to try if there are issues with bugs inside the place. I find it hard to believe this is a \"one time incident\" and have to think there are all sorts of health code violations.  I hope they can clean up this and still be a good place, but for me I will not go back, which is too bad because I'm all about supporting local business.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-03T08:40:58-0400", "location_id": "5213041", "id": "424740150", "user": {"username": "Chris H", "user_location": {"name": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "id": "49022"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Over rated!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56260-d5213041-r407136940-m11068-Jungle_Burger-McKinney_Texas.html#review407136940", "text": "Eaten here often for several years.

Well, he was wrong.  It took me over $25 (2 regular burgers, 1 small fry, and 2 small drinks) to find out.  Plus a tip was added for the server.\n\nThe burger was good, but not great.  The slender fries are cut in house, skin-on and have a spicy seasoning and, in our case, over cooked . I didn't notice if they had unseasoned fries.\n\nThe burgers are \u00bd pound and cooked to your request.  That part was fine except they didn't grill (as requested) my jalape\u00f1os and onions.  They were raw.\n\nIf you want to add bacon, cheese, avocado, etc. it would cost $1.00 for each addition.  In order to get my burger the way I usually do at my favorite place I would have paid over $12 for ONE burger!  That's ridiculous.\n\nI rated it average mainly because of their prices.   I'm sure there are other burger places that are similar in price.  So If you have money to burn, then by all means go to Jungle Burgers.  If you don't, then go to the NE corner of highways 5 & 380.\n\nI won't mention the name, just look for the location based on my indicated location.
