I had spaghetti and meatballs and she had the sausage baci al forno. We both thought the food was okay, but not great. My wife's dish was supposed to be \"spicy\" but she said it wasn't at all. She does like very spicy food though so maybe her idea of spicy wasn't the same. My dish was okay as well, but nothing great. The meatballs were good and helped me like the dish more, but overall it was just lacking a lot of flavor for me. The sauce was bland and didn't have much more than a small hint of garlic. The prices were average too and with each of us getting an alcoholic drink our total bill was around $40.

Maisano's is small, has beautiful decor and candlelight, plus they take reservations, which is what I was wanting this night!  Before we went, hubby said, you'd better check the menu it\u2019s been a while, who knows maybe the steaks are $39 now. So I checked the menu online and gladly reported that the Filet was $20. I drooled over the menu trying to select my dish, and everything sounded just so wonderful. Our reservation was for 4:30, and the place quickly filled up. Looking around it was just as gorgeous as I remembered the waitress lit the candle and then we looked at the menu, surprised to find that the online menu was not the same. There were dishes no longer offered, and Lord behold the filet steak was actually $31!!! The waitress was sweet, and soft spoken and sporting a large red-faced devil on her neck and black lipstick. It took a VERY very long time to get the bread, and unfortunately for us we went hungry.  Food delivery took a very long time, and arrived not hot.  Hubby said the chicken parm was so tender you could cut it with a fork, but the lasagna was not that great (compared to Mario\u2019s). My veal Marsala was cold but tasty. Though the prices were competitive this is not the place where you get alot of food and go home with left over\u2019s, or maybe that was because we were soooo hungry by the time our food finally arrived that we ate more than usual?  I really think the servings were sparse.  Some good points they were attentive to refilling our Iced Tea, there seemed to be alot of regulars, my food was tasty although cold, and most prices were reasonable (aside from the steak). I did mention to the waitress we were surprised that the online menu was so different, she said that when the owners split one locked the other out of the website and they couldn\u2019t update the changes, and yes the price on the steak did go up (by $11!!!!) I said well, we reviewed the menu and prices before we came out and were very unhappy to see we prepared our wallet and heads with wrong selections and price expectations. Honestly if it weren\u2019t New Years Eve and we weren\u2019t so hungry I would have left without ordering. Well, now we know why we stopped going, we now recall the very very loooonnggg wait for our food. You would think the owner would make an effort to correct the online menu, and make sure the food gets out quickly once it is ready...but alas, maybe this review will wake him up. And about the waitresses tattoo, I know this is America and she can alter her body whichever way she wishes, but honestly a demons red face on her neck like that? She should have worn her hair down, or covered it with makeup. Yeah, in all honestly it did affect her tip, just saying, it should have been a classier evening with this prices.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-31T15:50:17-0500", "location_id": "390110", "id": "336311530", "user": {"username": "TerriD9854", "user_location": {"name": "Walled Lake, Michigan", "id": "42792"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Excellent ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42538-d390110-r333602826-m11068-Maisano_s_Italian_Restaurant-Novi_Michigan.html#review333602826", "text": "Amazing food, you walk in the door and you smell the goodness.
