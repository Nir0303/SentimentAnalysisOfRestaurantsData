My partner had pancakes ands eggs Benedict with beyon style corn beef and potatoes. The pancakes were the best id ever eaten. Everything else was good but not excellent. The service was fast and friendly. The Decor was odd old school European mixed with French provincial. It was pricey, more so than IHOP, but it was higher quality.

At this time, their menu was different and they also offered breakfast in the evening.  It was very good, so when we returned this time, we ate at Mimi's for dinner again.  The new menu for lunch/dinner has a lot to be desired.  I wasn't too thrilled with my food and the server was MIA for quite a bit of time that I gave up and just ate most of it.  We tried Mimi's again for breakfast before we left and it was very good! I had the strawberry waffles and they were some of the best I've tasted! The service at breakfast was much better than dinner, however we were there for longer than we'd planned because the kitchen was a bit slow at cooking.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-11-08T04:10:59-0500", "location_id": "364281", "id": "184047175", "user": {"username": "Therese7215", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Wright, Kentucky", "id": "39421"}}}]}
