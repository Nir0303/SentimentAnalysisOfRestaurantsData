The broccoli is well cooked, but still with a hint of crunch and the vibrant green color. The beef is of higher quality, than most Chinese restaurant use in this dish. It is tender and the sauce is very flavor. Hubs also brought home some of the fried rice, but I've never been a fan of it in general. However, if the fried rice had been heated up, I\"m sure it would have been delicious.
