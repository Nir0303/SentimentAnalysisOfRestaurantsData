And food prep was extremely slow. For $7 I could've bought everything required and made a loaf of French toast at home in the same amount of time.\n\nOther items ordered were mixed. The omelet was good and came with home fries and toast...a meal, decent value. The pancakes with eggs and bacon (or sausage) was barely a meal and also not good. Pancakes were thin and rubbery, not fluffy. \n\nThey only serve breakfast during breakfast hours (until 1130 weekends) so you can't ask for anything else (even though they give you one menu with all food items). There's no grapefruit juice. Ham is thin deli sliced so not worth it to sub for bacon or sausage.\n\nOverall this was a VERY big disappointment for someplace that's highly touted for breakfast.
