It's a very nicely designed plaza / park and seems to be a nice place to visit. When the trees get bigger, there will be nice shade.\n(Downside: the H/C indicators on the walkways are too small.)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-30T21:19:28-0400", "location_id": "10386210", "id": "378138281", "user": {"username": "barbara b", "user_location": {"name": "Carrollton, Texas", "id": "55588"}}}]}
