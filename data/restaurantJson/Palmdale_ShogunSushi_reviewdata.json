The decor and menu are clean and classic and that's it - and don't worry, he has some wonderful, big rolls - they just aren't moving or on fire or anything.\n\nMake sure to call them and Google Map the place before you go - it's staff is so small it's not open 24/7 and it's tucked back from the road across Q-6 from the Hammack Activity Center in a small, unassuming looking little place with no big signs or anything.
