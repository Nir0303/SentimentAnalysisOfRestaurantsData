Funky lighting effects - interesting without being distracting.\n\nNo drinks menu: telling me there is a \"full bar\" and then me reeling off a load of drinks they don't have, and then the server trying to remember what beers they had, is not really a productive way of getting me to drink your products. Just print a menu for goodness' sake! Who knows, maybe you had some premium stuff that I would have liked, and you would have liked to have sold, but nobody knew it existed!\n\nMy pollo mole was only tepid when it came out. Though all the food arrived at the table together, I suspect mine had been left on the side while others were still cooking. \"Taco Tuesday\" involved a good selection of condiments to go with the meat... but a long wait to actually get a taco.
