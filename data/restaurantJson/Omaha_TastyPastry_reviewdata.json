It's a ten minute drive from my office, so I counted on having to stay late that night to make up for the time at a restaurant, and I wasn't sure what to expect, because I had assumed it was a bakery.\n\nI got there, parked on the street less than a block away (their parking lot is weird, and I was afraid I'd have trouble getting in and out).  I saw the pizzas on the menu (the pictures are super helpful) and was shocked by the prices!  The mini pizzas start at $2.75 for pepperoni, and go up to $5.00 for the most complex.  You can chose things like carmalized onion, bacon, and smoked gouda (which is what I got and loved) and chicken bruschetta, and more classic options.  Side salads are just $1.25.  They don't even let you tip.\n\nThe pizza crust is hand tossed, and is super delicious.  The crust under the toppings is fairly thing, but the edges are airy, soft, and delicious.    I watched him build a different pizza that had artichokes, and the guy was loading it up.  Even at the great prices they don't skimp on the toppings.\n\nI've only been once, and have already told lots of people about it.  I will probably call in an order next week to bring back to the office!  I am curious about the desserts, but I didn't take the time to look.\n\nBy the way, I made it back to the office in time, because the service was super fast (and the people were all friendly)!  \n\nYUM!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-03-10T07:01:17-0500", "location_id": "4823080", "id": "354340035", "user": {"username": "Kacie W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Crispy pizza, made with local cheese.

First and foremost, this is a pizza place and the pizzas are perfect. They have a variety of suggested combinations or you can build your own. The crust is pizza perfection \u2013 light, thin, crispy. The sauce and all toppings I\u2019ve tried are excellent. Pizzas generally come right out of the oven within 10 minutes of ordering (possibly a tad longer if they\u2019re super busy). The price for single-serving pizzas (starting around $3.50) is extremely competitive. We\u2019ve also sampled several soups and all have been delicious. The pastry desserts are among the very best in town. The flaky torte (apricot and raspberry) is amazing. Dessert prices are also very competitive \u2013 around $2.50. The dessert portions can be easily shared by two or more. Very substantial full cakes and tortes can also be purchased for around $15.00. We\u2019ve watched the pastry chef create a raspberry torte (several layers of flaky crust, raspberry jam, and a creamy filling) \u2013 the price she charges is a great value given the work she puts in to produce each torte. Most places would charge double, or triple for all of their menu items. The restaurant is a true neighborhood joint. It\u2019s simple, warm, unpretentious and sometimes full of patrons \u2013 but that\u2019s the charm. Parking is limited, but never a serious problem. We\u2019ve found the staff members to be friendly and very approachable. The gentleman who typically builds the pizzas is very charming. I only wish they were open 24-hours.
