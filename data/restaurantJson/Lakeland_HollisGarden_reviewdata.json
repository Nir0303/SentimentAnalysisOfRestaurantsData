We started our visit to Lakeland here, there is free parking here which allows immediate access to this garden, Lake Mirror and Barnet Family Park. It was a really sweet little garden, with a great use of space. A really nice place to take photographs. The paths aren't really suited for a toddler on foot, although fine for the buggy. There is a lawn which she could run around in without causing problems, and a small pond with fish which she found fascinating. It's small enough and close enough to the play park that you can visit with a toddler, enjoy the gardens yourself before a walk around the lake and/or visit to the play park.
