I would often walk to and from work from my home located near 83rd & Peoria Av.  I would pass by this delightful old fire station which was the original fire station  #  1.  -- It had that ol\u00e9 time unique look about it as it stood there in town. Recently this distilling company purchased and remodeled the old fire building. - What a unique display of architecture revised. --Benches, bar stools, & the bar made of beautiful wood ... Original fire hoses & firemen's uniforms decorated the walls . --- We went on the tour of the distilling area and was given a very nice  informative talk about how they use this area. We were given the history of the fire station as well.  Plus we were even given samples of their products. It was quite fun to go back down memory lane of this  old station turned new ... I would recommend Lucidi,  just for the fun of it !

When we entered the distillery, we were immediately greeted by Mariah, she was very nice. She gave us the background on the building before the Lucidi's took over, how it was an old Fire Station, etc. Our tour of the distillery room was done by A.J. He was amazing, funny and very knowledgeable and encouraged the people in our tour to ask questions! During the tour you get to try three different types of spirits, vodka - gin - Canadian whiskey as well as getting one of nine different cocktails at the end of the tour!
