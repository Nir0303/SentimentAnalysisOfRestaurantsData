We ordered a takeout of two of the rice noodle soups and they were out of the place good, authentic. Lots of noodles and ingredients. Soup base was full of flavors that blown us away. It was so spicy that we couldn't finish all. The leftover was saved for the next meal, just heated up and added a bit more noodles and vegetables into it.  $20 for two meals for two adults, you can't get better than that!

I obviously wasn't feeling adventurous tonight but the \"staples\" I ordered were excellent. Huge portions, not greasy at all, and the dinner combos come with crab rangoon and a choice of rice.
