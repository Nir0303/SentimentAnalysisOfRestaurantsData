The restaurant was less than half full but this location is rarely packed. We were seated in a booth in the corner under a crackling speaker that was very loud and blaring harsh, inappropriate music. We asked to have the speaker turned lower and were told we were the second person to request it but they aren't allowed to do so. They moved us to another booth and a very nice asst. manager visited our table. He explained that the owner wants the lights low and the music loud and they weren't allowed to touch it. This is a family restaurant in a family neighborhood, not a nightclub. If the speakers were good quality and the music appropriate, it would not have been so irritating. One diner had the Zack n Cheese pulled pork sandwich with fries that they said was very good. A second diner ordered the fried catfish dinner which arrived in a pool of grease and was very dark. It was served with a slice of garlic toast. The sides were the diner's choices of fries and collard greens. After using 5 napkins to soak the grease up off the plate and off of only one of the 3 pieces of fish, the diner cut into the fish and it was mushy. It was very overcooked and tasted like burned oil. The dinner was removed from the check and the Adam & Eve sandwich with boneless pork rib was substituted. The diner enjoyed that sandwich. A third diner ordered the BBQ Turkey sandwich which instead of the expected pulled fresh roasted turkey had a few slabs of what seemed like a pressed turkey product like spam. It was not good, but he ate it anyway. His side was fries. As a vegetarian in a BBQ restaurant, I ordered the baby greens and gorgonzola salad. The toppings included dried cranberries, slivers of carrot and roasted, salted peanuts. It is served with packets of Ken's steakhouse raspberry vinaigrette and a slice of garlic toast. The combination of toppings with the vinaigrette was pleasing and the greens were fresh. The disappointment is in the greens possibly not being rinsed to get the well water preservative taste off of them. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was hot and tasty. Our server was very efficient, cheerful and accommodating. The assistant manager was very nice. They were accommodating in everything that they had authority to do and were eager to please the customer. We got 2 checks for the table which were around $ 26 and $ 30 each including tip. If you go to this restaurant, order any pork BBQ menu selection. This seems to be the common denominator in the only meals that were enjoyed.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-04T05:24:31-0400", "location_id": "4165942", "id": "414526756", "user": {"username": "Cross4me", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Always Good Food !", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34727-d4165942-r389569004-m11068-Park_Avenue_Barbeque_and_Grill-Wellington_Florida.html#review389569004", "text": "Great Wings and close !

First, the good. Lots of reasonably priced items, and the variety of side dishes are above average. The portions are massive. The BBQ sauce is sublime (and probably the reason everyone comes back). Service is also fantastic and the wait staff is super friendly. But there's one thing I'd improve tomorrow if I owned this joint. I'd give it a big makeover. The 90s theme clearly drives customers away, especially with all the food choices in the area, and a local crowd that demands a hip atmosphere. Lindbergers and Tijuana Flats are much more palatable. Shane's food is not nearly as good, but yes, the atmosphere is even better there ... and that's not saying much. It would be money well invested and probably not cost much to give Park Avenue a new look. I'd go a lot more often if it looked better because the food is pretty darned good.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-18T19:44:14-0400", "location_id": "4165942", "id": "222786305", "user": {"username": "CJMcKay", "user_location": {"name": "West Palm Beach, Florida", "id": "34731"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Disappointed", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34727-d4165942-r213056419-m11068-Park_Avenue_Barbeque_and_Grill-Wellington_Florida.html#review213056419", "text": "My wife and I had the baby back ribs.
