The food was pretty good.  We had fish, burgers, and sausage with potatoes.   The service was friendly.  We were turned off by the sticky tables.  The server said it was some sort of finish that once wiped it would dry and be sticky again.  I guess those who go in there to party and drink don't mind but those of us who want a nice meal do.  Maybe adding tablecloths or something would be helpful.  I think they are mainly catering to the drinkers and are not much in tune with those who just enjoy good food so that problem will most likely not be remedied but if you can handle your drink glass, sleeves, and napkin sticking to the table it is worth it.
