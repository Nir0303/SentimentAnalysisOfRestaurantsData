My wife and I visited the Franklin County Historical Museum in Pasco, Washington last week and were so amazed at what we witnessed. The Museum was originally constructed in 1910 as part of Andrew Carnegie's worldwide library construction program. A new library was built in 1962, after which the building served several different business concerns, ending in a period of abandonment and neglect. In 1980 the Society was offered the opportunity to use the building as its museum. Between 1980 and 1982, the building was beautifully refurbished by volunteers. It opened to the public as the Franklin County Historical Museum on January 3, 1983. The Museum is managed by Sherel Webb the Franklin County Historical Society Administrator, and after talking with Sherel you can feel her passion and love for the Museum and it's future growth. Sherel pushes hard to follow the Historical Society's mission statement that \" we shall preserve and promote the history of Franklin County through educational publications, programs, and the operation of the Franklin County Museum \". The Museum has two levels of exhibits, a gift shop, archives for research, meeting rooms for programs, memorial books, and monthly and quarterly publications. They also have Museum memberships available. Admission is Free, and donations are welcome. The display pieces in the Museum where fantastic, and brought back a lot of memories. It is definitely worth a trip to this small dessert town to see the History, and to learn more about the stories of the pioneers of Franklin County.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-10-30T07:32:34-0400", "location_id": "1490705", "id": "323184843", "user": {"username": "grandslamhomer", "user_location": {"name": "El Cajon, California", "id": "32331"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Good nostalgic history lesson", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58674-d1490705-r275043421-m11068-Franklin_County_Historical_Society-Pasco_Tri_Cities_Washington.html#review275043421", "text": "Great collection of artifacts which will bring back memories to silver haired visitors.
