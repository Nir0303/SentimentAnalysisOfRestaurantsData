We would go past and I'd see the Southeast Asian Cuisine and I'd ask him about it. He'd share stories how he loved their food, that it is quite reasonable, and from what he could tell quite authentic. I had served in Asia when I was in the military and he said it might remind me of an authentic little restaurant you might find over there. We visit Appleton a lot for the restaurants and shopping, so many great choices. If it wasn't for his recommendation back then I would have never known about this little gem. After that first wing I vowed I'd be back to try their menu, he said he'd come too. So we actually planned a lunch not long after. I had a great lunch and even bought a couple wings for my wife, she loves traditional bone in wings and loves spring rolls so figured I couldn't go wrong. I was right, she loved them.  My wife have been back three or so times since and enjoy it.  Sometimes I forget their there with all the options Appleton has.  The stuffed wings are a big draw. They d-bone chicken wings and stuff them with spring roll filling and somehow grill them so the filling stays in. When you eat it you use the wing tip part as a handle and eat the boneless part with the filling. Hard to explain until you try it. I have eaten quite a few from here. I think I encountered a little piece of chicken gristle once or twice, but usually I don't, so keep in mind they probably painstakingly d bone by hand. I quite enjoy them, they have a thin sweet & sauce or a very spicy hot sauce for dipping them in, not kidding, its spicy. They have a nice menu on the wall, you order and pay before you eat. I have tried the Curry Noodles, Pad Thai, Squash Curry, Pineapple Curry, Pad Cashew, Fresh Spring Rolls, Egg Roll (which is a deep fried spring roll, Veg, Pork, Chicken options), Stuffed Wings (of course), and the Thai Iced Coffee. Of those above dishes its hard to rank. I enjoyed them all I probably prefer the Curries & Noodles over the Pad Cashew, but like I said, I haven't had a bad meal here. They have nice portions, and if it says \"spicy\" on the menu, you better believe its going to be spicy, they don't joke around and I really like that about them. If its \"spicy\", they mean it, even some of the regular dishes I found have some mild spice level to them. The Pineapple said, Medium Spice, and it was quite spicy, but I quite liked it. So this leads me to believe we have near native levels of spice going on. My buddy always says one of the greatest compliments is to have members of that restaurants ethnicity eating there too. This place does have a lot of members of the Asian community eating here which bodes well for authenticity. I notice a lot of people order the Pho soups and they look so delicious, but I have a hard time deviating from my curries, one of these days. They have limited seating inside, and a small parking lot, if you get here and its full, that happens, they do take out too.  More often than not i have to drive around in a circle because they are on the corner of a one way by a print shop.  I've never had an issue ordering, read that in one review, the girl/lady that has taken my order quite a few of the times I've been in speaks perfect English, probably first or second gen American. The only other person that ever took my order was one of the main guys and he speaks very good English too, not native, but has always been cordial, you can tell he's usually busy though and probably doesn't have too much time to chat. My good friend who introduced me to it also really likes their dishes. It did indeed remind me of some of the small restaurants you come across a lot of in Asia, nothing fancy, actually its a lot fancier compared to Asia.
