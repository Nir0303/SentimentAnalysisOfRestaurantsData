Displays change every couple of months but are always interesting and of high quality artistry. The bad thing is that the hours open are business hours as the gallery is on the 3rd floor of Meridian city hall. Not so convenient for those who also work those hours. I do encourage everyone to make an effort to go visit. The area is just one large open space with a few glass display cases and two walls lined with art so it  can be just a \"drop by\" visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-07-13T20:32:10-0400", "location_id": "560228", "id": "167464814", "user": {"username": "dianep1982016", "user_location": {"name": "Boise, Idaho", "id": "35394"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-12", "title": "Local Artistry!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35531-d560228-r153880775-m11068-Initial_Point_Gallery-Meridian_Idaho.html#review153880775", "text": "Each month the creations of local artists are showcased.  An artists' reception is held at the beginning of month, for a personal \"tour\" of the creations.
