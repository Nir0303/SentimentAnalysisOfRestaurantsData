Normally, it comes with beans but I requested that they were not included because that just didn't sound right for breakfast. The egg, potato, bacon and salsa were a nice combination for a tasty breakfast. The salsa choices seem to be mild and medium, nothing too hot. \nIf you need a breakfast burrito early, this may be difficult because they don't open until 8:00am, which is somewhat late for breakfast on the way to work. They were very quick about preparation as it only took 3-5 minutes. It was reasonably priced around $6.00 which seems to be the going price for a breakfast burrito in Yorba Linda.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-02-06T13:54:36-0500", "location_id": "908594", "id": "193294864", "user": {"username": "Tim_the_Enchanter417", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Forest, California", "id": "32596"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Hands down the BEST meal on my trip!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33298-d908594-r186901070-m11068-Tio_Chavas_Mexican_Restaurant-Yorba_Linda_California.html#review186901070", "text": "So we had some time to eat in between hockey games and our phone pointed us to this restaurant.
