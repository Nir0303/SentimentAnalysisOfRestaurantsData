Breakfast is amazing! Lunch is awesome as well. We've loved every dish we've ordered. I love the breakfast gravy, corn chowder soup, grilled cheese, and my parents love the ahi burger. They have a children's menu and the cheese pizza is enough for 2 kids!  I think most people drive by so quickly down Beach Blvd they miss it.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating. I feel like I get a gourmet meal without breaking the bank.  Choose to dine inside or on the patio.
