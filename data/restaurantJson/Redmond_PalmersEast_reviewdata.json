Drinks and food is cheap. They have a pretty good menu for a dive bar. In addition to the regular fried bar food, they also have a good selection of burgers. I got the blue cheese burger and it was delicious! And no I wasn't drunk at this point. We also ordered the calamari and jalapeno poppers. The jalapeno poppers were the kind with cream cheese, which is the kind that I like. The calamari was a pretty basic calamari. Even though we got a bunch of fried food, it was good, it wasn't drenched in oil like a lot of fried food is. We were there for a going away party and the place was packed out \"our party\" The place is pretty small but they also have a little room in the back with a pool table. A lot of locals come here too! Fun little place with karaoke. Karaoke and drunk people is always fun to watch :) If you're looking for some bar food in the Redmond area, this place is good. There's a small parking lot across the street that they share with another restaurant but not much parking there.
