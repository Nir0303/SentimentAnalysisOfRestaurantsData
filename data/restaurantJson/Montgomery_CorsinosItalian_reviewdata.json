The restaurant has virtually no atmosphere.  Looking at the building from the outside, you probably wouldn't go in, and the inside is not any better.  Corsino's patrons don't care.  The food and the family are the essence of the place.  The restaurant serves simple, American Italian dishes and pizza with several salads and garlic bread, virtually nothing else, at lunch and dinner.  Combos, such as spaghetti and lasagna, are popular, as is the eggplant dish and pizza.  What makes the dishes so good are the authentic cheeses, fresh ingredients, and Don's touch.  When we eat at Corsino's, the hard choice is between an Italian dish and pizza, so, we often order one of each and share them, always with the Dago salad.  Corsino's is not open Saturday or Sunday, so Friday night is their busiest time.  They also do a large takeout business.  I recommend you drive by, go on in despite what you see, and try the food.   I think you'll like it.
