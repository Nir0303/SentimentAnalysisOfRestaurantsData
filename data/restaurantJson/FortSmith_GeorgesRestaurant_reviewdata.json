Thankfully, they bring an extra plate with your food order, because I had to go digging. \n\nThe cheeseburger is served open faced and needless to say, fries were stuck to it like glue.\n\nThe fries were cold. I dont know if they were old or if it really took that long for me to get them off the one plate and onto another, but neither of us could eat them.\n\nThe burger was no better than anything I make at home. \n\nOur sever had a smile on her face WHEN she bothered to come to the table. When being the key word. I waited for quite some time for her to bring us a check. After quite the wait and no check in sight, I went to the counter hoping she'd either see us waiting to pay, or the cashier would get it for me. Sigh......we encountered another longer than necessary wait at the counter.\n\nWe won't be returning. Cold fries, cheap kraft singles for the cheese, poor service, and a customer that had to practically resort to begging in order to get the check.....I can't think of one reason to go out of my way again for this, when there are so many other burger joints to choose from along the way.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-06T08:56:38-0500", "location_id": "2001802", "id": "435115265", "user": {"username": "Wanda B", "user_location": {"name": "Arkansas", "id": "28925"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Dependable- Friendly", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60816-d2001802-r430179591-m11068-George_s_Restaurant-Fort_Smith_Arkansas.html#review430179591", "text": "My go to place for lunch- always good!
