Even though I will forever miss Emos kalbi, Aoyama (new owner and menu) has a lot going for it. Service was prompt and upbeat. We ordered Cherry Blossom sushi, kalbi appetizer ($$$), sashimi platter : and all were presented beautifully and tasted fresh. The sushi-chef later came by to check on us and offered free tempura/fried icecream, which everyone enjoyed! Great dinner by Aoyama. For the sushi purist, they seem Korean and not Japanese.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-19T09:45:12-0400", "location_id": "10336148", "id": "374585019", "user": {"username": "l0cal2tracy", "user_location": {"name": "Tracy, California", "id": "33184"}}}]}
