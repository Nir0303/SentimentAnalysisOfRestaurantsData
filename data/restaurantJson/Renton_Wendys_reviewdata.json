I'll give anybody a second chance - we're all human.  But when it happens TWICE in a row, something is WRONG!!  I expect average fast food, but I don't expect to get ripped off TWICE in a row.  Avoid Adena if you do go there - if she doesn't try to give change for a $15 instead of the $20 I gave her, she's sitting in her car smoking.  Plus her car, a gray vehicle, is parked in a prime customer parking space, not in the back, out of the way. Just to make it even more miserable, alarms go off two plus minutes without being silenced.  It must be challenging to turn off the alarm if it goes off.  I wonder what is being grossly overcooked.  I wouldn't go to a Wendy's again if they gave me the food for free.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-04T18:41:33-0400", "location_id": "10278606", "id": "370291099", "user": {"username": "Kayakerjim", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
