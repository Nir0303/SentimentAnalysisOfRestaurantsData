The Kitchen Sink crepe is delicious (and HUGE, SO FILLING) and every single thing my group ordered was delicious. We took a suzette to go. We returned Sunday morning for a quick brunch before hitting the road- cinnamon apples and candied walnuts.\n\nService is great, owner is too kind. The Penny Path is also more than happy to make substitutions/additions to their listed crepes and were extremely accommodating for our friend with food sensitivities.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-25T18:54:27-0400", "location_id": "3952993", "id": "367624403", "user": {"username": "Antennapedia", "user_location": {"name": "BLOOMINGTON", "id": null}}}]}
