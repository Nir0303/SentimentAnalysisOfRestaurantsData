You see, I am a green minded person and I know that fast food trash accounts for 33% of our litter problem, so I prefer to use my reusable cup instead of asking for water in a paper cup. The lady at the window told me she is not allowed to fill my cup....but could give me a paper cup of water to fill it myself....THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF MY PLASTIC CUP!!! Someone said its to ensure I wont get sick from the water....BAH! its the same water...no matter the cup. Come on JACK IN THE BOX! I love your burgers, but you cant keep this up.
