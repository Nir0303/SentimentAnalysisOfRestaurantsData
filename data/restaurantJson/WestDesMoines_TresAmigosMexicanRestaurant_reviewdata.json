The fajitas were some of the best I have ever had. They were not sizzling when they came out like you normally get but the taste was amazing.  Just the right amount of onions and peppers as well.  The nacho chips and salsa were very fresh and tasty.  Our waitress was very attentive and over provided good service.

Before this, She tried to take our salsa and guacamole, which by the way cost us $2.95 for a fourth of a cup but I told her I was going to finish that $2.95 guacamole. \n\n Really? \n\nI find it very irritating, I just want to sit at the table and relax after a meal and the waitress is pushing us out the door, and trying to remove the fork from our mouth before the meal is completed!\n\n There were one additional individual sitting in the restaurant so it was not as if she was busy!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-06-03T12:57:05-0400", "location_id": "8261828", "id": "277614840", "user": {"username": "kathleen s", "user_location": {"name": "Des Moines, Iowa", "id": "37835"}}}]}
