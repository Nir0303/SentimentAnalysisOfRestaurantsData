With thoughts of a BBQ sandwich in mind - much like I get when I'm in parts of VA and NC -I took a seat on a swivel stool at the lunch counter and asked the friendly waitress about the BBQ sandwich.  She explained that the pork is sliced and sauce is on the side. Slightly disappointed but hungry, I decided to give it a try. While waiting, I casually scanned the other occupants, interior design and decor. I observed the cook preparing my sandwich in the kitchen, which was open and on the other side of the lunch counter. Sure enough, just like the waitress said, he was slicing away on a pork loin. I saw him take a couple slices of sourdough bread, toasted them, and set several quarter inch cuts of tender loin on the bread. The coleslaw was added to the top layer of meat, not on the side, per my request, and a dill pickle spear garnished the plate.  The waitress set my California-style Poor Boy before me along with a side of baked beans and a side of sauce. I took a spoon and dribbled sauce on the meat before each bite. Wondering if the sauce was made from scratch in the restaurant, I asked the waitress and she said it came from a vendor; it might have been Sweet Baby Ray's. The beans were hot and tangy, but I suspect they, too, are a name brand. It was a delicious lunch, but a little pricey - $13 (before tip).  I think that for a place that boasts of BBQ, it falls flat.

Most of the kitchen and waitstaff have been there as long as I've lived in the area (4 years).\n\nNice bar at the kitchen (at the rail, not a liquor bar), my preferred place to sit.\n\nSome of the cooks there are truly impressive -- the sheer volume of orders they can juggle is staggering and impressive.\n\nFood is generally great with a wide selection on the menu.  Omelettes are particularly good.\n\nParking is easy (good sized lot + easy street parking behind).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-05-19T11:24:09-0400", "location_id": "521663", "id": "273074143", "user": {"username": "jeffvier", "user_location": {"name": "Hayward, California", "id": "32480"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Good for the price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32480-d521663-r272044635-m11068-Emil_Villa_s_Hickory_Pit-Hayward_California.html#review272044635", "text": "Convenient location.  It looks better in the pictures though.  We needed two rooms and the front desk guy upgraded our second room at no extra cost.  The beds were very comfortable but the pillows are much too thick.  \n\nNice pool.  Breakfast was good with a very attentive worker. The hotel could be cleaner,  but was acceptable for the price.  \nSeveral fast food options nearby.  No elevator!!! ??? Fine for young people,  terrible for older travelers.
