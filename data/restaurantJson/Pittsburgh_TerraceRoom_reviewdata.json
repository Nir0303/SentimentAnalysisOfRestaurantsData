The Terrace Room was running a limited menu, four course special for the holiday. Some people may have considered it a bit expensive ($65 a person,) however the menu included various items, such as lobster bisque and a lobster tail entree.  I had the stuffed duck, which was very good but I couldn't finish it all after my salad and appetizer! My husband had the lobster tail, which he picked because he had never had lobster before, and he really enjoyed it. \n\nIt wasn't as crowded as we expected it would be at 7 pm, but the host did say that they had quite a few cancellations. The atmosphere was very nice and the service was very quick. We sat down just before 7 and we were out before 8 because our food came out quickly. I would have liked to go try their speakeasy, but I wasn't feeling well enough to go after dinner (which had absolutely nothing to do with the food!)\n\nI would definitely like to go back on another night to try out their regular menu as well.
