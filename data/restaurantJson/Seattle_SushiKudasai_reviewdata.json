We just missed the cut-off to get seated at the sushi bar and all the tables were already reserved. Since we had a flight to catch later that night, we opted to sit at the bar where the drinks were. The waiter/bartender was fairly easy going and held up a good conversation. We ordered the omakase but it turned out to be a bit disappointing because it just wasn't the same experience. They didn't ask whether we had any food allergies or preference for a certain type of fish over another. Presentation was decent and on all in one plate versus one at a time. Another downside was how loud the bar area was due to the conversation next to us. I get it, it's the bar area and I might've been a tad bit uptight but I was expecting a bit more class. I'd go back a second time to give it another try but definitely at the sushi bar.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-05-15T19:23:41-0400", "location_id": "3603185", "id": "373225327", "user": {"username": "Fieryx21", "user_location": {"name": "New York, NY", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Fast food done right", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d3603185-r308785010-m11068-Sushi_Kudasai-Seattle_Washington.html#review308785010", "text": "Needed a quick lunch between medical appointments, so nothing heavy or spicy.

The staff are very friendly and the vibe is nice - upbeat music playing on the radio, and everyone seems to be in a good mood. The prices are reasonable - you can get a simple roll like California for around $5-6 - or you can order a deluxe option for about double (but they are worth it - quite elaborate).
