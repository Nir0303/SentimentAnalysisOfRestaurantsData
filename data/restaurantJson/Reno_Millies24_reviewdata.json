Decided to place an order to take back to my room (after a long day).  I approached the hostess, at the front counter, and asked if I may place a to-go order.  She handed me a menu and I told her that I already knew what I wanted to order.  I first ordered a half ham sandwich, on rye, and inquired as to what the soup of the day was.  She had to go to the Manager (I'm assuming he was the Manager) and he told her chicken tortilla soup.  I asked if I could have the chicken noodle (which is a regular menu item) and she said yes.  She asked me several times what type of bread I wanted on the half sandwich and I asked if they have rye.  After the third time, she said wait a minute and she walked to the back of the restaurant where the Manager was.  She returned and told me that they do have rye.  I also ordered a green salad and requested vinaigrette dressing.  (Note:  menu states that all salads come with fresh bread).  After a long wait, she called to me that my order was ready.  I picked it up and asked that everything was in the bag such as silverware, chicken noodle soup and half ham sandwich on rye bread.  She said yes everything is there.  I went against my gut instinct to check the order while I was at the restaurant and instead returned to my room.  That was my first mistake.  While checking the order, I saw that the sandwich was on white bread so returned to the restaurant for the correction.  Same individual just stared at me, took the sandwich and walked away.  Prior to this, I told her that I did not see the fresh bread which is to be supplied with the salad.  She said that she had put it in with the salad herself so she knew it was there.  The Manager was at the other podium and said nothing.  Once I received the sandwich (and checked it) I returned to my room.  Then, I realized that I only received a plastic fork and knife with the order, and how was I to eat the soup.   Once again, returned from the 10th floor to the 3rd to Millies24 to obtain a plastic spoon.  Not one employee to be found anywhere.  After several minutes of waiting, the Manager came from the back, but did not ask me if I needed help.  I told him that I need a spoon in order to eat my soup.  He pointed at the display near the coffee line and told me I could get one there.  When I looked, there were only knives and forks.  I told him that there were no spoons there and he told me to ask one of the individuals at the coffee/ice cream counter for one.  Note:  Had to stand in line in order to request the spoon.  Never once did I receive an apology from either of these employees.  When I returned, yet again, to my room and began eating this very difficult to obtain meal I realized more issues:  There was NO bread with the salad (perhaps she thinks the croutons is the same as bread).  I received TWO salad dressings.  The vinaigrette (which I ordered) which was almost empty (probably running low) and received a large amount of Ranch dressing.  The chicken noodle soup was missing ALL noddles.  NOT one noodle in the entire order.  Albeit a large amount, it was basically filled with largely chopped carrots, celery, odd tasting broth and chicken that looked like it was from the bottom of the barrel. It did appear that there may have been a language issue with these employees, but when working directly with the public the restaurant management should place employees for a suitable position.  As I have dined here, in the past, and have ordered to-go meals, I may very well return to Millies24 the next time I stay at the Eldorado.  However, if this had been someone's first experience with Millies24 I would suspect that it would be the last.  Restaurant management should really address a situation, such as this, and remedy the situation before it loses additional diners.
