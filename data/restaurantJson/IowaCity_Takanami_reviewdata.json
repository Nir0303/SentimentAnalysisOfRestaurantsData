We ordered and the original order came out fairly fast, but when she dropped off the sushi we ordered another roll.  After 20 minutes and everyone else at the table basically finished with dinner I asked her about the other roll, \"Oh, let me check on it\".  I watched her as she went to the sushi station and picked it up...it was there she just forgot.  I ordered the Kobe roll ($11) and it was so charred it had a bad taste, made it extremely difficult to eat.  I also ordered the Rangoon\u2019s which $9 for 5...way overpriced.  There \"entree\" menu does not make since, you need to offer better/more options there are some people who don't eat sushi.  They should offer bento boxes at night too, really no reason not to. Then to top it off I had one of their new offers that they advertise $10 off $50 plus I had a gift certificate that was purchased, the waitress came back stating they can't take both, someone needs to tell them that there is a difference between a coupon and a gift certificate.  Overall experience was average or below.  Much better sushi options in town and with more and more springing up they need to step up their game.  In the future I will not be back and will go to Konomi in the future.  I think this place thinks it is in downtown Chicago not downtown Iowa City.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-08-26T07:04:34-0400", "location_id": "1525978", "id": "174130625", "user": {"username": "Keeley C", "user_location": {"name": "Coralville", "id": null}}}]}
