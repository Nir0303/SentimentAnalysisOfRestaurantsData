Our waitress made us feel welcome. But the place smell old and needs remodeling. I bet if they payed attention toward the entrance and remodeled the inside this place would pop!

She literally told me that I could leave and it was all because I requested to have  the sourdough bread to be warm. I would've left but I was there to gather information for an article I'm writing.I personally will never go back. Review of the food: we started with the Lukiuka & Noodles homemade basque sausage over a bed of garlic noodles, The home a sausage was very very good the noodles were cut into bite size ( a no no) and a little overcooked but the flavor was good. We order the soup they told us the soup of the day was the Manhattan clam chowder that's what they called it nothing like Manhattan clam chowder but again good flavor. I ordered the Veal Pot Rost and they were out tge time was 12:15pm the restaurant opens at 11am. I order the Lamb Roast thinthly sliced not much of the natural juice but replace it with a gravy, very homey just like the rest of the entries Talapia and Meatloaf ( very salty). I was trying to order from their daily specials. Dessert, Gateau Basque it was nice but I should've been thought out totally we had some areas they still tasted a little frozen. This is a restaurant I would've loved to have been able to visit over and over to a friends and family big crowd but with such a pompous of a owner I would never set foot in it again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-12-12T13:15:16-0500", "location_id": "545717", "id": "244205322", "user": {"username": "Quban", "user_location": {"name": "Calif.", "id": null}}}]}
