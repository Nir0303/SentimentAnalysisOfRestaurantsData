In Kahului is an authentic Hawaiian food restaurant called Da Kitchen. It's rated #1 out of 99 restaurants on Maui by TripAdvisor, and rightly so. As far as authentic Hawaiian food goes, it was the best I'd ever eaten... until now. Right here in my backyard is Island Grinds, a little \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurant serving the best Hawaiian food ever, even compared to the #1 restaurant in Maui. Even as I'm writing this I'm dying to run over there, knowing I would be personally torn between the Pupu Chicken and the Short Ribs, but happy either way knowing I'll add plenty of the best teriyaki sauce.

This place is 100x better, the macaroni here is flavorful and the rice comes out nice and warm. I recommend putting their teri sauce on it. Mmm. I'm so glad my wife and I happened upon this place.

That means to me that they have a very high opinion (deserved or not) of their food. Tried  the lunch special. For only $5.00 I got a deep fried boneless chicken thigh which had crispy skin and no breading (that is a good feature to me), an ice cream scoop of macaroni salad that was overdressed (not as much so as one usually finds in area) but one of the better ones we have found, an ice cream scoop of rice that was terrible. Usually you can put a fork into rice and it crumbles but this was so sticky and dry that a chunk would break off without breaking into grains. Finally it came with a drink. a good deal for the price but somebody needs to do something about the rice. The place was almost empty when we arrived but filled up while we were there. Many customers looked like Tongan or Samoan natives which speaks well for the food usually. Like the islands where the only change expected for the day is the tide and it takes all day, the pace of service is also laid back. Don't expect fast food. I probably will not drive across town to eat here again but if I find myself in the area, I definitely would.
