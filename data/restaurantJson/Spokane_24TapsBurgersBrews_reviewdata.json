The double fried fries are some of the best homemade fries I've had in a long time and I could eat a plate of those now. Our group had Chicken Strips, Poutine Fries and a Poutine Burger. We'd have given them an excellent but the less beer we ordered, the less they came around. We had to go to the bar to get our tab and pay at once. We'd go back for sure!
