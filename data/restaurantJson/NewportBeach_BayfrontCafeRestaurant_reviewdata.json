What we ordered was well presented, tasty and the sushi was good value but the service was slow (not that we really minded but others who might want a faster in-out might be disappointed).\n\nGreat friendly welcome by the guy dressed as spiderman on the front desk (it was halloween Saturday after all) and the evening ended up with a live band who played well and created a good atmosphere.\n\nThere were 3 of us, 3 meals were ordered but only 2 were delivered ! Rather than make too much of a fuss we split the ample meals between the 2 adults (whose food arrived) and my friends daughter (whose food did not arrive).\n\nWonderful location to watch the sun go down and many people seemed to enjoy the vibe.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-31T09:10:08-0400", "location_id": "854627", "id": "433280177", "user": {"username": "Rhys D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Hidden Newport gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32780-d854627-r314916622-m11068-Bayfront_Cafe_Restaurant-Newport_Beach_California.html#review314916622", "text": "A bit off the beaten path located on Bayside drive near Balboa island.
