No drinks or water for nearly 30 minutes.\n2.   Over an hour to get appetizers.  One of them was a dip and not chips were provided.   Took two times to get wait staff to bring and by that time, the dip was cold.\n3.   One person ordered prime rib and it came out as a 1/2 inch thick grilled rib steak.  The wait staff and the manager both said that prime rib and rib-eyes were the same.   That is totally incorrect.\n4.   It took over 3 hours for us to eat and get out ticket.\n5.    The buns on the hamburgers were old and fell apart.   They apparently rubbed butter or something on the outside and heated them up to freshen them, but they just fall apart in your hands.
