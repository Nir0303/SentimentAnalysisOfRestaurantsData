Not the least of which was down to the superior service.  Our server, Jared, made our night a truly excellent experience; more than dinner, it became a highlight of our trip thanks to the fun event he turned our dinner into! He was extremely knowledgable from the seafood to the wine and he struck the perfect personable balance with us.  Every recommendation he made was fantastic and we really appreciated his surprise of Boston Cream Pie for my first trip to Boston!  Ask to be seated in Jared's section and you're in for a remarkable evening. A true professional with a great sense of humour.  Thanks, from your Canadian couple Monday night!

Beginning with the menus printed with Happy Birthday along the top, we knew it would be a special evening.\n\nFirst, the highlights: fabulous cocktail list, briny fresh oysters on the half shell, extensive wine list, including many by the glass selections, fresh seafood and delicious steaks, and side dishes for sharing that were delicious. \n\nWe started with warm sourdough bread and butter and our cocktails (I recommend the perfect G&T) and moved to a shared plate of a variety of the freshest oysters.  My husband had a bowl of Sherried Lobster Bisque (with several large chunks of lobster meat) and I started with the Burrata Salad (one of the creamiest balls of burrata I've ever experienced.) My daughter had Spicy Tuna Poke, a combination of chopped raw tuna in a spicy sauce served on three layers of crisp, flat wonton.  I got to taste both that and the soup and I would have loved any of them. \n\nMain courses were filets for everyone but me (why go to a seafood restaurant and order beef, I ask?) Everyone seemed to enjoy their steaks, my husband added some shrimp to his, and the meat was cooked to the proper medium and medium rare as ordered.  Sides were incredible: really amazing Lobster mac 'n cheese (easily a meal by itself; it was so rich I could only eat a couple of bites), Shaved Brussels Sprouts with bacon dressing and crisp parmesan crumbs, grilled asparagus, and saut\u00e9ed spinach.  My main course was Sesame Seared Yellowfin Ahi Tuna. I requested it VERY rare (I really don't like cooked tuna) and it came out perfect: basically raw tuna with the very slightest crisp edges, thin-sliced and served Sashimi style.  The sesame seeds gave it a slight crunch that was a lovely counterpoint to the creamy tuna.\n\nI probably had the best Key Lime Pie I've ever eaten for dessert, and they served such a large slice I couldn't finish it all.  Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was enjoyed by my husband.  The restaurant brought the birthday girl a huge Baked Alaska (on the house), flamed it at the table, and served us all a goodly portion of it.  Gratefully, no silly singing accompanied dessert. She and I had a lovely 50-year old port to go with our dessert.\n\nHaving said all that, and it really was a great evening, I still have a few comments that are less than positive:\n\nWe were seated right next to the waiters' station, even though the restaurant was virtually empty when we arrived.  I should have requested another table and didn't.  Having the waitstaff moving around right behind me, seeing platters of food sitting there, having them entering orders on the computer... all very distracting from the dining experience.\n\nThe presentation of the oysters and appetizers was a bit disjointed.  They all came out at once (even though we thought we had made it clear we wanted the oysters first and then the apps) and our table was so crowded the waiter ended up pulling up all the leaves on the table to make it larger. Awkward, at best, since the food was already there and we were seated.\n\nOne of our party is both gluten and dairy sensitive, which was made known at the time of the reservation.  There was very little she could eat and we weren't offered alternatives to anything.  We were able to get the spinach and asparagus without dairy or breadcrumbs and she had the filet, but there were no starch options that were gluten/dairy free, nor were there any desserts she could eat. \n\nWe had ordered a Port from the drinks menu and it wasn't available.  Someone from the bar came over and offered us an alternative, which we accepted.  While it wasn't a real problem, it was 25% more expensive than what we originally ordered and we weren't warned about the cost.  My feeling was if they were going to substitute a higher priced wine for one they didn't have they should either tell me the uncharge or charge the same as the original that we picked.  \n\nAside from those few glitches, it was a fantastic meal for a special occasion.  It's quite an expensive restaurant so I, at least, won't be stopping in regularly, but if you can handle the bill, go for it!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-17T13:11:57-0400", "location_id": "1020869", "id": "428891437", "user": {"username": "wendyoes", "user_location": {"name": "Wallingford, Connecticut", "id": "33959"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Fine dining with splendid seafood", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d1020869-r427588477-m11068-The_Oceanaire_Seafood_Room-Boston_Massachusetts.html#review427588477", "text": "Oceanaire was just a short walk from our hotel.

We made a reservation 3 days ago and requested a booth and that request was not honored. No big deal, we were seated elsewhere.  After 10 minutes of no service, not even a glass a water, we asked a manager if there was a waiter assigned to our table and he looked confused and then sent over one of the bartenders to take our order.  After another 15 minutes, the waitress/bartender informed us that they ran out of 2lb lobsters which we had both ordered.  Their solution was to replace the 2lb lobster with two 1 1/4lb lobsters but wanted to charge us for the extra 1/2lb.  They should have just charged us for the price of the 2lb lobster since it wasn't our fault they ran out.   They finally brought us our lobsters but they they forgot to bring our side order of hash browns.  I also realized at this point that we never received our bread or complimentary olives/radishes/pickles.  When I brought this up to the manager \"Gil\", he said he cleared them from our table when he served us our appetizers essentially calling me a liar.  He insisted he did and ran around away and never saw him again.  Then another manager \"Luca\" came over and asked how our dinner was.  We proceeded to explain to him the comedy of errors and at least he was professional enough to apologize and make good for all of the service issues by adjusting our bill accordingly.  Overall, the food was good as usual but probably the most disappointing aspect of the evening was the first manager Gil's unprofessional attitude and inability to rectify the service issues.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-10T19:04:13-0400", "location_id": "1020869", "id": "426827797", "user": {"username": "LisaNewYork", "user_location": {"name": "New York", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Nothing Spectacular ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d1020869-r426146326-m11068-The_Oceanaire_Seafood_Room-Boston_Massachusetts.html#review426146326", "text": "Even though we have our favorites in Boston, we always like to try somewhere new. This restaurant was simply ok, nothing over the top and nothing too bad. One thing that really angered me and put a bad taste in our mouths before we'd even tasted the food was how we were greeted. We had reservations and arrived about 20 minutes early--when using public transit in Boston, you always leave early just in case--and were made to wait. The hostess suggested we go have a few drinks and wait for our table; we are not drinkers and there were no seats at the bar anyway. We would've waited outside but it was pouring so we waited in the vestibule. The valet guy finally tired of us being in his way and all of a sudden a table was ready. Mind you, there were many open tables in the dining room when we arrived. Now, on to the meal. Our server was all right, we had crab cakes and swordfish which were prepared well and tasted good. Lastly, the dessert we had was not \"traditional\" Boston Cream Pie as the filling was a little off, but it was huge and stilly tasty all the same (see photo). In a place like Boston there are a ton of awesome seafood restaurants, not sure we'd head back to this one.
