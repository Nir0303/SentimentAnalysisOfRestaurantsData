Apologies for the only brief meeting he had with you folks the other day. Gary and Jessika have owned the Briar Rose, in the heart of the city of Boulder for a little over 13 years. For a great length of that time Jessika was the general manager and on site daily. Three years ago when they were blessed with their first and only child, Jessika decided to stay home with the bundle of joy and enjoy those fleeting joyful young child years. For multiple reasons, including the now 3-year-old daughter, they have chosen to live off-site and devote more space to guest rooms. In their stead, the passion that the current general manager has for the Briar Rose is unparalleled and the dedicated young staff take on the daily routine of operations (cooking/serving/cleaning/etc), allowing Gary time to meet with guests at breakfast several days a week and still afford time to go to his full-time job and home to his loving family each night. We do understand that this is not the typical living/owner situation as many B&B's but earnest intention of our outgoing staff is a level of friendly customer service to make up for the time that Gary is not here personally.", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-10-24T15:28:30-0400", "id": "431343964"}, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-19T09:16:09-0400", "location_id": "74337", "id": "429741081", "user": {"username": "Barbara2Two", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Lovely BnB in Boulder", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33324-d74337-r429530120-m11068-Briar_Rose_Bed_and_Breakfast-Boulder_Colorado.html#review429530120", "text": "We spent one night in this lovely BnB in Boulder.

( they had just received a two-night stay cancellation) we booked for two-nights June 15, June 16 2016. Not knowing what to expect seeing as this was our first bed & breakfast stay, I can say it was very wonderful. The bed and breakfast its self was very beautiful, the gardens are amazing, the tea was exceptional its a very relaxing environment, the street noise was a little loud, but we didn't mind it. I probably would not recommend this place for the party couples. It was very peaceful and stress free. Breakfast was nice a little different for us but still nice. Rooms were clean and comfy. We loved our staff they were incredible, some were a little odd at first I guess considering they were young and we come from two totally different parts of the US. Most of the staff were friendly and helped when ever we needed it. For example, the first nights stay my husband and I developed Altitude sickness we were miserable and the young guy in kitchen helped by recommending peppermint tea and brought it up to our room. Something else I must brag about the staff is they knew we had gotten married and they brought us roses champagne and chocolates on our wedding night.

Handy location -- we walked into town for dinner, for example -- and we enjoyed the extensive yet still cosy garden, the tea service in the evening out on the lawn, and the large, clean and comfortable room we had in the carriage house. The staff is young and friendly and there certainly were several of them, although since this is more of an inn it just doesn't have as personal an approach as you get at many B&Bs. Overall, though, there's definitely a laid back vibe in line with the meditation center on the premises. Breakfast was fine, although not as unique as we had thought we'd find -- a vegetarian scramble, a nice fruit bowl and some muffins. Some may be disappointed that there's plenty of street noise in the garden despite the walled enclosure, but we were OK. Comfy, if a little worn, public spaces; we viewed it all as homey and were happy.
