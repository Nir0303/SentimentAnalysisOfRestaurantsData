We were greeted very nicely and the morning breakfast people were great - they have a very nice spread included in the price which is a plus.  After we left and returned to CA , our 7 year old discovered his beloved stuffed animal was left behind.  We immediately called the hotel and they started to look.  Though the night shift turned up nothing as she was alone and couldn't leave the desk she left notes for the next day shift.  I called first thing in the morning, they stated they saw the note and asked if she could call right back.

My stay was for two nights and I was only there to sleep so I didn't see the need for my room to be serviced.  There wasn't a safe in the room so when I left the next morning I had to take my valuables with me since the do not disturb hanger was gone and my room would undoubtedly be serviced again. \n\nOther than that, the towels were old, not soft at all.

The positives were that the room and hotel were very clean. The staff was very friendly. The bed was really comfortable, although could use new pillows. The breakfast was very nice. Had everything you need to get the day started. There was always coffee in the lobby any time of the day. The hotel location was good.  Set off the main roads, but very close to all shopping and restaurants. The draw for this hotel must be the baseball stadium next to it. \n   The cons were minimal.  The room was a little on the small side, ther was no room safe, and my biggest complaint, which spreads across the entire chain is that they charge an extra $10 per person, per day for anyone over ONE person in the room. I've had this also happen in ocean city MD, in a Holiday Inn and suites.  The room we stayed in sleeps 6 but were charged extra after the 3rd person. When booking, on the phone, with a person, I was not told about this charge. I noticed it when I thought the total was a little high after I had already booked the room. For this reason, I probably will not stay here again unless I have club points to use up.
