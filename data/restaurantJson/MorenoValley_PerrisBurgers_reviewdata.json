And the chicken they use for their chicken tacos has this horrible smell! The French fries are good but only when they decide to change their old gross oil they usually fry it in!

Seriously, who did you pay off to get a rating like that? Now normally, I don't bother writing poor reviews for places I don't like (it's kind of a waste of time for me).  BUT think I can make an accept ion for Perris Burger. Now, I've been to Perris burger a total of 4 times -only two of which I used the drive thru instead of going inside- and my past few visits were so-so. But this visit in particular just sealed the deal on my view of this place. \nProblem #1: NONE of the cooks wear gloves or hairnets. That's a big problem for me. Why? I've had experiences where I used a restaurant restroom and seen an employee use the bathroom and head straight back out to the kitchen, without even taking a glance at the sink. Just because you put up a sign saying, \"All employees must wash hands,\" doesn't mean that every employees is going to obey that policy. And as for the hairnets thing..Hello, hair sheds, and can easily fall into your food. \nProblem #2: The place itself is nasty. The napkin dispenser looked like it hadn't been wiped down in weeks, the chairs had all kinds of stains on them, and the windows were so dirty you could barely see out of them. *Tip: You might want to order a cup of hot water to sterilize your silverware in before you use it...just saying..\nProblem #3: Quality of food not worth the price they charge. I had ordered a large plate of carne Asada fries (cost me like $6.50) and it took almost 15 minutes for me to get my food. My whole table got their food in order, then even the people who came in and ordered way after me got their food. Finally, when my table is more than halfway done with their food, I decide to go and check on my order, thinking that they may have forgotten about me. I asked where my fries were and the employees looked around puzzled like they had no clue where my food was at. Then someone says \"Oh yeah go get the fries out of the microwave.\" Why were my fries sitting in the microwave for like 15 minutes??? Really? Sit down to dig in to my food because I'm starving and thoroughly pissed and my food doesn't even look that great. Most of my fries were either burnt or got soggy. I didn't get any guacamole or sour cream either. For the price I paid and the time I had to wait! I probably could've just gone to Alberto's to get better quality food. \n\nOverall, if for whatever reason you decide to stroll through Moreno Valley on a trip, do not waste your gas and money on Perris Burger. There's plenty of better quality/priced fast food joints less than 5 minutes away.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-11-22T11:09:07-0500", "location_id": "4929827", "id": "328437962", "user": {"username": "Emillia901", "user_location": {"name": "Moreno Valley, California", "id": "32743"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "What a dump!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32743-d4929827-r309398600-m11068-Perris_Burgers-Moreno_Valley_California.html#review309398600", "text": "Walked over from our hotel.
