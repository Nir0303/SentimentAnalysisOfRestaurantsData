I was surprised that they did not offer bread on the table. I think this would be a nice touch. My friends had sandwiches which looked very good. All in all I would recommend this place simply for the atmosphere. They also have cute little rooms upstairs with jewelry hats, and children's clothes and books for sale.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-25T15:57:35-0400", "location_id": "441374", "id": "217508599", "user": {"username": "rhonjon1", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Still fabulous even under new ownership", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44876-d441374-r210920051-m11068-Miss_Aimee_B_s_Tea_Room-Saint_Charles_Missouri.html#review210920051", "text": "Miss Aimee B's looks to be a traditional Victorian tea room, but it is so much more. Everything is made in house and tastes wonderful. There are different quiche on the menu every day and several soups as well. A wonderful and unique beverage is milk lemonade which is delicious! Make sure to save room for dessert as these are all made in house as well and are taste and decadent. I am a huge fan of a French dip sandwich and the offering at Miss Aimee B's is just about the best I have ever had. The bread is fresh every day and the meat was roasted to perfection.
