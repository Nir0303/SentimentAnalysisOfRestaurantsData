We started the visit by watching their two 12 1/2-minute films on Steinbeck's life and the Salinas Valley. Both were interesting and packed a lot of information. However, the broken and missing seats in the theater foreshadowed what was to come. The museum itself is organized chronologically by Steinbeck's books and stories with each display including information about the setting of the story and the author's life at the time. You really gain a deeper understanding of writing and how the place drove the writing. The problem is that several of the interactive displays were dated and broken. It just feels like they built a great museum 10-20 years ago and haven't maintained it since. Almost every section had something either missing or inoperative.

We'd both read Steinbeck in school, and I love writer museums quite a lot. We thought this would be a great place to stretch our legs. \n\nThe pricing was bit high for us, but we had a lot of fun. The short films gave a great summary of the city of Salinas and John Steinbeck's life. The displays were very informative and many were interactive (touchable), which makes it family-friendly (and friendly for me, because I love to fiddle with everything). Also, the displays put Steinbeck's novels in the right perspective, which allowed us to understand Steinbeck's influences. We both came away with a new respect for John Steinbeck, being so progressive in the time period he lived in. \n\nWe spent about an hour or so wandering around. The museum is medium-sized, so it's pretty walkable. Unfortunately, it seemed as if many of the interactive things weren't working when we were there. We'd pick up a telephone to hear a conversation, but it would only be static. Or, we'd look through a telescope and see nothing. Also, a lot of the biological specimens there seemed like they'd been there a long time (a few had broken in half, a couple seemed to be missing, and 1 jar in the gift shop had completely dried out). I feel like this museum was a bit outdated, and may need to repair/re-do some of the exhibits. \n\nOtherwise, my husband and I had a great time.
