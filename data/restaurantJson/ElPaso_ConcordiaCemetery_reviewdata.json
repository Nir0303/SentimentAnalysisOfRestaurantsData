The only real green section of the cemetery is the Jewish Sections, which the local Synagogue's have perpetual care groups to help with the care of their Section.  Concordia is a mix of religious and private held graves. Historically the cemetery was never as lush and green throughout, as the Jewish section.  So we let folks know 1) we use reclaimed/purple water to help us nourish our Xeri-Scaping plants that are native to our Climate.  Ans 2) Using water to  artificially green the cemetery is only a waste of our limited water resources, as well as, affecting the character of the original cemetery which is more importantly a Archaeological Site.
