The show is smoothly staged and the attractive group seems to be in a synch that I've only experienced in venues including SF and NYC. We saw the preview and except for a lighting error that was fixed by the director the performances rocked the house. The sexy dancing and sensational singing, plus positive personalities made you live inside this show and forget the present .... it got this audience rolling with laughter and simultaneous applause. Anyone from 14 on up is okay for the gore is theatrical, not really sordid, but the laughs are real. Chicago is a 10.

They perform 3 different operas per season in an intimate theater in Palo Alto. We saw the advertisement in a local newspaper and decided to attend. There were evening and matinee performances of Il Trovatore which made it quite convenient. We had nice seats a bit more than halfway down the theater for $75 per seat. The singers all had excellent resumes- several had even sung at the Vienna opera. Costumes were very nice as was the scenery. There were refreshments for purchase before and during the intermissions. The conductor/ director was quite personable.

I sure won't.\n\nBut it does help that the show I saw here was great. First time here was to see \"In The Heights\". I had no expectations and did not realize what I was in store for.\n\nThe place was fairly easy to find. I did not have a problem finding parking, but I could see it being a problem if the show I went to wasn't a preview for family and friends. I did not drive around the vicinity to see if there were additional parking spots. I could imagine the lot I parked at to easily be packed. \n\nThe entrance to the theater was simple and expected for a community theater. However, step inside and the stage was more grand than the outside would have you believe. They have a pretty legit setup here. The chairs were comfortable and nicely spaced. I wouldn't call them first class roomy, but nothing I could really complain about. The orchestra was out of view as they were in \"the pit\" \n\nNow I have to commend the sound. This could be either the venue's work or the production and the sound tech who was running it, but you could hear every actor clearly. It sounded natural--simply amplified to be louder. I've been to many productions and a lot of times although they are obviously amplified through the sound system, for the most part it always sounds muffled. What point is loud if it is not clear? But here, at least in the production for \"In The Heights\", the sound team or just the sound setup was great. You could make out every word that was spoken. The acoustics of the venue may also help, but what theater isn't built without that in mind? So I had to give my props there.\n\nAs for the show I saw here, \"In the Heights\"--it was awesome! I would have to be my favorite show I've seen and I've seen a good handful. I've seen shows that had a much higher budget and I still enjoyed this the most. The music, singing, rapping, dancing, acting.. it was all there.   If you're new to live theater shows, \"In The Heights\" being played at Palo Alto Players would be a great first show to see.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-09-18T11:22:25-0400", "location_id": "4889297", "id": "177688498", "user": {"username": "Geno N", "user_location": {"name": "Bay Area, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "pt", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-01", "title": "Teatro local", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32849-d4889297-r216492245-m11068-Palo_Alto_Players-Palo_Alto_California.html#review216492245", "text": "Teatro da regi\u00e3o, em Palo Alto, com pe\u00e7as e musicais sempre em cartaz.
