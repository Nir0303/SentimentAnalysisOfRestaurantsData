I should have done some research before I bought the tickets.\nHeather the Musical in itself sounds like it would be something to see.  Well, maybe it might be and obviously was, or, unless the rest of the audience did as I did, didn't check the reviews.   My wife and I were so disappointed because the led actors were really pretty good.  I think most adults can understand how kids might act among themselves and certainly we don't have to be reminded.  We were  hoping for something more positive.  It is imperative that one checks reviews on shows.  I rate the theater as poor because of it's setting and certainly in our view nothing compared to more common venues.  We left at intermission as did others.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-03T16:37:21-0400", "location_id": "10520724", "id": "388868734", "user": {"username": "SINROSSCO", "user_location": {"name": "Fredericksburg, Virginia", "id": "60824"}}}]}
