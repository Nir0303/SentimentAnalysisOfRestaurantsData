We found it all at Intermezzo, which is part of one of our favorite restaurants, The Wine Cask in downtown Santa Barbara   We had an early dinner, around 6 PM , and the weather was perfect ( duh, we are in Santa Barbara!) we sat out side and our pups sat at our feet.  The waiter brought them water and suggested some grilled chicken strips for them ( obviously spoiled pups) our dinner was delicious. We were looking for a light meal, and the menu did not disappoint.  Our sales were garden fresh, with just the right amount of dressing to lightly coat the green leafy butter lettuce, but not drown your taste buds.  We had Share -plates including a delicious flatbread with home made mozzarella and sweet, ripe tomatoes.  We ordered a bottle of one of our favorite Chardonnays, but instead of bringing us the bottle they brought the opened wine in a carafe. There was no,opening of the wine at your table, nor tasting of the wine before it was served. We didn't know that our bottle would be served that way.  We only ordered a bottle because we were on foot, and hoped to cork the bottle and take the remaining wine back to our hotel for a night cap.  For this reason, I took off a star.  Someone should have mentioned that fact because had we known, we would have only ordered the wine by the glass or half carafe. Next time we will keep that in mind, as our dinner was otherwise delightful, the ambience was pleasant, and we and our pups were quite full and satisfied when we left.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Mitchell S, Owner at Intermezzo, responded to this review", "text": "We are delighted you and \u2018your pups\u2019 enjoyed dining on our Mediterranean Courtyard and are sorry there was confusion with your wine order.

Our wonderful local wineries deliver tanks of wine, saving the waste of glass bottles, corks, cardboard boxes and even the paper labels!  Of course sitting outside it\u2019s entirely possible you did not see this coming so next time we\u2019ll be delighted to package any leftover wine for take-away\u2014and thanks again for your warm review.", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2015-04-27T10:26:48-0400", "id": "268340061"}, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-22T11:33:36-0400", "location_id": "4062498", "id": "267389235", "user": {"username": "Lauren R", "user_location": {"name": "Palos Verdes Estates, California", "id": null}}}]}
