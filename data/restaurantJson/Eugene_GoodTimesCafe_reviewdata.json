This may be my third visit.  \n\nArriving around noon I was visiting with a Groupon Coupon.  When I mentioned my coupon the server said \"That is great have a seat and I will be right with you.\"  She arrived immediately, told me the specials, and suggested that I might want to consider the happy hour brew specials. (Some venue's will not let you use the happy hour specials with a groupon)\n\nOrdering my favorite Micro and a Rueben sandwich was a wise choice.  The Rueben is my all time favorite and Good Times does it right!  A little more meat than I usually like but who complains about that?  The fries were cooked perfectly and a large portion.\n\nA friend had the fish and chips.  I would skip the fish and chips and go for a burger or sandwich.\n\nGood food and great service.\n\nBathrooms and booth were spotless.
