But whatever you're in the mood for, this place probably has it.\nGreek souvlaki, gyros, Mexican tortas or tacos, burritos, nachos.\nOr if you want camarones, or club sandwiches, or hot and cold grinders. Everything is here to satisfy every taste.\nOh, they have pretty good pizza with any topping. \nI tried their Mexican pizza. Beans, onions,hot chili sauce and special spiced pork. Awesome!\nNext visit, I'll try the calzone with a house salad.\nThey usually have the 2 pie special with free soda or a large cheese pizza with mozzarella sticks or hot wings.\nEither way, you'll like this place.\nAnd Del Prete Italian bakery is next door so you'll want canoli's to top off the meal.\nMangia!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-14T09:14:36-0400", "location_id": "4160818", "id": "318608046", "user": {"username": "Raymojay", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
