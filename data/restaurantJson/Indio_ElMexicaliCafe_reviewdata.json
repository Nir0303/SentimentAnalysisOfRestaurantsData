And, boy-oh-boy I'm happy I did!  If you want really excellent, fresh, home-cooked Mexican food -- i.e. not Americanized Mexican food -- then, look no further.  I believe El Mexicali has 3 different locations.  This was the first (think it's been around for years) and it's the only one I have tried.  The restaurant is in Indio, which is a very easy drive from the West Valley and sits near some fairly heavily used train tracks off of Indio Boulevard. (Sort of fun to hear the trains go by -- not unpleasant in any way.)  The restaurant is extremely clean and has 20 tables or so.  The staff couldn't be nicer... Helpful too as many of the dishes were new to me.  On my first visit, I ordered the Costillas de Puerco con Nopales (Pork Short Ribs with Cactus) and a small bowl of Menudo (only served on Sat/Sun) and both were AMAZING!  My second visit was 3 weeks later and all the waitresses remembered me.  Food was just as good as the first visit.  They will see me many. many more times in the future.  Can't recommend it highly enough!  Totally worth the drive...

I must say the meat they used in his was absolutely delicious. It was like eating a super tender beef roast. If you never have had a Cadillac Margarita treat yourself to pure deliciousness!
