We had a reservation for 6:45 pm, and arrived at 6:35 pm.  We were told they would seat us \"on time\" and we would have to wait.  Nowhere to wait except out on the curb in front of the restaurant -- and hostess finally came to seat us at 6:42 pm  She explained that they didn't want to overtax the waiters,  but all we had wanted was to sit down, maybe a glass of water.  Waiter seemed to be very inexperienced.  Restaurant Week menu included 3 courses for $50 so we chose to use the regular menu, as dessert wasn't important to us.  We asked if our Passport Dining Cards could be used (buy one entree and get one entree complimentary) and were told we could use two cards per table -- since we were two couples, that was fine.  We had to send back a cocktail that wasn't prepared properly,  the bread was served with laughably insufficient butter,  and organic greens salad for $12 had a few sliced veggies and one tiny cherry tomato.  Courses were served very slowly.   Wine by the bottle was charged at same price as wine by the glass.  We shared a delicious dessert.  When we were presented our bill, we were told that the policy is to charge a whopping 20% service charge to anyone who uses a Passport Card.  With 5 glasses of wine, one cocktail, four appetizers and one dessert,  the 20% service charge wiped out any savings from the Passport Card.  We would have tipped the waiter appropriately,  and fairly,  but the 20% added to our bill made a difficult evening even more unpalatable.  Sad to say that we won't be returning to Bellamy's.  Poor hospitality,  poor service.  IF they are not prepared to participate in Restaurant Week, they should skip it.   AND if they are not interested in the Passport Card program, they should not be part of it.   If they want to make up the rules for their customers to follow, they should be very up front with what those rules will be.   There are so many nice restaurants in north county and on Grand Avenue now, I have no idea why anyone would want to overspend for a trip to Bellamy's.

It was a bit over salted and the seasonings were too noticeable to make it more than an average dish. Expected more from their kitchen. The mushroom ravioli was good. Service was excellent. New decor was dark and kind of pedestrian. New chairs were super comfortable. Service was excellent. A lot of contradictions at this meal. Will try them again after they finish their remodel.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-17T12:43:59-0500", "location_id": "3806728", "id": "348647231", "user": {"username": "Hoofmark", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Nice meal, strange space", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32358-d3806728-r345954151-m11068-Bellamy_s-Escondido_California.html#review345954151", "text": "My Wife and I were invited by friends to join them here.  We arrived before them, so we waited in the lounge.  There was an unusual piano bar like an extra small baby grand shoved up against a pub table.  The lounge had some other quirky decor from the flooring to the the light fixtures to the random artwork.  We went and sat in the dining room when our friends arrived, and the hostess was very professional.  It seemed like a pretty limited menu.  Our friends went with a prix fixe as it was restaurant week, and it seemed that the waiter gave the impression that we should all do prix fixe.  For first course, my Wife had a soup which she liked--I think it was squash.  I had tuna tartare which was good too.  For entree I had fish which was a little overdone and tough.  I should have had the steak which our friends had, and they were satisfied.  Dessert was good--chocolate 3 ways.  Overall, it was an ok meal, but I'm not sure it's worth the $50/person.  I think I'd rather eat somewhere closer to the beach.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-08T13:25:33-0500", "location_id": "3806728", "id": "345954151", "user": {"username": "knightmuves", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Food can be good, but service is \"iffy\"", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32358-d3806728-r345876499-m11068-Bellamy_s-Escondido_California.html#review345876499", "text": "We went in before a local movie and let the waitress know we needed food when it came up. Short story, one of the orders never came out and after 20 mins we had to bring it to the servers attention, and she then obviously made up stories like \"it's on the way\", when clearly the order was never put in. Every single D\u00eener who came in with or after us had been served thier food. Finally after 40 minutes we got our burger, which was good. She didn't apologize and offered a small discount, but it's the blatant lying. Just tell me \"oops\", bring me a sip of wine and we can make it work. The \"flatbread\" that day came on a soft bread, not a toast like we expected. I think they can be a great restaurant, the food is usually good.
