The sirloin steaks are always cooked right, and  are flavorful.  The ribs fall off the bone and are totally worth it!  They give you peanuts to start and you can throw the shells on the floor...which normally you wouldn't do at a restaurant, but there is something empowering about tossing shells on the floor!  OK, back to the review!!\nThe staff are always friendly and helpful...they work really hard...and the manager is friendly as well and really cares that you have a good experience!!\nIf you've never tried the fried pickles, they're worth trying once and they prepare chicken right too!  The only thing I've found to be not so good was the roadkill!  No, really, that's what it's called.  I'm sure some like it, but it wasn't my favorite!  Also, it gets busy, so make sure you use call ahead seating!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-06-18T09:20:49-0400", "location_id": "2487636", "id": "383716508", "user": {"username": "Robert T", "user_location": {"name": "Menifee, California", "id": "32703"}}}]}
