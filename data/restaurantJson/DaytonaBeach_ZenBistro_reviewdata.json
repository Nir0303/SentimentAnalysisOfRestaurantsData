I asked for it hot and it was perfect.  It as the burning but gave me the sniffles.  They used Thai paste which is my preference.  Nice fresh dish, good size portion.  I went for lunch and they had a good crowd.  If you like Thai, this is a must stop.  Traditional menu of Curr, noodles or rice.  Plus a Kile twist, pumpkin curry sounded unique.  Lots of locals, I met couple next to me who go every week.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-05-18T18:34:11-0400", "location_id": "1059875", "id": "374359341", "user": {"username": "M P", "user_location": {"name": "Harrisonburg, Virginia", "id": "57809"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Great Thai Food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d1059875-r367871280-m11068-Zen_Bistro-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html#review367871280", "text": "I visited here with my wife and son.

However to me there seemed to be a sweetener added to the sauce to please the typical american taste buds, which is why I can not give it a 5 star.
