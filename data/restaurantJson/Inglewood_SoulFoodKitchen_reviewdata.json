This one has now ranked the spot of my 2nd favorite location! I came here last Saturday and was IN AND OUT! For those people who know this restaurant chain know that the lines and wait times can most definitely be outrageous but it's worth it! When I arrived I was warmly greeted by all of the employee's and while trying to decide even offered some suggestions! I always think that's an awesome thing to have to provide your customer's! Knowledgeable staff that can make great suggestions on the menu! I went with my normal which is the Smothered Chicken with two sides (Dinner comes with two sides). Mac N Cheese is one of my favorites and I always get a double portion of it! Everything came out fantastic! I have no complaints! You really can't go wrong with the HUGE portions of food that they give you with a reasonable amount of money that they charge!
