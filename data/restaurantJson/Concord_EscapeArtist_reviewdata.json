That was so great of him. This was our first escape experience and we did the Da Vinci Office escape room. It was so fun and challenging.

The owner/manager, Vinnie (sp?) was super helpful and easy going, with a great attitude. He explained things very well and offered only as much help as we wanted for our first attempt. The room we played in was very interesting and the puzzles had a nice range of difficulty, but were not un-figure-out-able. \n\nYou get flashlights (it's pretty dark in the room), a white board for writing notes on, a bin to place personal belongings, and a 2-way radio so the manager can be in contact with you or if you want/need anything. (The door to the outside is not actually locked in this scenario, not sure if others are.) There's a timer in the room to track your progress by. You can ask for hints over the radio if you get really stuck, but it's up to you if you want help or not. \n\nOverall, a super fun way to spend an hour. I would think it would be awesome for a fun team-building exercise, or any size group (they accommodate up to 8 per room, per slot.) Check out their website to schedule your slot and number of people. \n\nAt the end you get a fun pic with your time and the room you accomplished, (if you get through!)
