Apparently he was in Italy that very week in search new wines and ideas for his little joint in Flagstaff.\n\nNow... when you are sitting next to a campfire in the the Tennessee woods, and a lifelong friend from Indiana tells you about a great place for authentic Italian pizza in the sleepy mountain town 2 hours north of Scottsdale AZ, where you live...  If you are me, you get your butt up to Flagstaff and check this supposed gem out.  That's exactly what I did.\n\nI loved the tiny interior which consisted of a long communal table and about 6 bar stools for counter top seating.  The menu is charming in it's simplicity.  We had the cheese plate, house red wine (from Italy of course), and shared a pizza.  It was phenomenal.  Simple food made from simple ingredients that was clearly constructed with attention to detail, tradition, and care.\n\nWhen you hear a rumor about good food in interesting circumstances...

Everything was fresh and delicious. Pizza special last Saturday was amazing.  We even brought our kids, and they adapted a simple pizza for the two of them.  We sat inside on the end of a community-style table setting. Kids could watch the pizza being made, which was a bonus for them.  We loved this place and will definitely go back.  As well as our visit went, whether or not this place is \"kid friendly\" would depend on your family and your expectations. Our children are 5 and 7, and were well behaved. Inside, you'll be in close quarters with other diners, so children staying in seats is a must. (Our family arrived well after dark, so maybe they have outdoor seating available that we didn't see?) While the servers were welcoming, some other guests frowned at us for bringing out children. This is a great place for food and friends, and I don't see any reason we couldn't return as a family for more tasty food.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-08T09:25:44-0400", "location_id": "2621718", "id": "402877776", "user": {"username": "Marion W", "user_location": {"name": "Phoenix, Arizona", "id": "31310"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Party in my mouth!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60971-d2621718-r401900627-m11068-Pizzicletta-Flagstaff_Arizona.html#review401900627", "text": "We loved everything about Pizzicletta!
