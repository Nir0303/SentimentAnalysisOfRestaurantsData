We were brought here by friends on the first visit and totally enjoyed the food. Then we booked the big table for lunch two days later. Service was wonderful with Nina, the assistant manager in charge. Prices reasonable and food delicious! I especially liked their 'pots', one being the salted fish, chicken, and egg plant pot. We also tried a Peking duck on the second visit. Carved table-side, fresh and tasty. I think this will be my new favorite restaurant in SGV from now on. Ample free parking at the parking structure behind the restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-28T20:51:38-0400", "location_id": "10810550", "id": "432555030", "user": {"username": "ROCruiser", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Nice new Chinese Restaurant in Alhambra", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29078-d10810550-r414420922-m11068-Jasmine_House-Alhambra_California.html#review414420922", "text": "The food is very good and the portions are large.
