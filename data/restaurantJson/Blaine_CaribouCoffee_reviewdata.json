If you use the drive-thru I recommend that you not be on a tight schedule or are running late. It is not uncommon to wait 10 to 20 minutes to get your coffee. At the speaker, you often have to repeat your order or correct them. One day I had to repeat my order 3 times. Another time I got to the window and got and paid for the wrong order. I waited while they remade my correct coffee and then they were going to charge me again for this coffee! I already paid for the wrong order and handed the wrong coffee back. There is no consistency in staff which makes a huge difference in customer service. They also never ask for your perks number. It's the little things that customers appreciate. Not sure if they are understaffed or what but the employees always seem rushed and frustrated when they get more than one customer in the drive-thru or walking into the store.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-04T14:23:01-0500", "location_id": "932333", "id": "324521117", "user": {"username": "Janet D", "user_location": {"name": "Cambridge, Minnesota", "id": "42923"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Great place to meet friends", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42878-d932333-r255118410-m11068-Caribou_Coffee-Blaine_Minnesota.html#review255118410", "text": "We love the one located at cty.
