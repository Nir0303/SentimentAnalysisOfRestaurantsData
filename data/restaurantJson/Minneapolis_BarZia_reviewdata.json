Their online menu makes it easy to order, and it was ready right on schedule. I liked the seasoned beef topping (not usually my first choice, but Chicago pizza isn't my husband's favorite--compromise is key!); it was spicier than I expected, which I liked. I was a little disappointed by the crust. I like a thick, hearty crust; this was a thin crust in a deep-dish pan. The flavor was good, just a different texture than I expected. The sauce also had really good flavor. All in all, it was very good, and we'll order it again.
