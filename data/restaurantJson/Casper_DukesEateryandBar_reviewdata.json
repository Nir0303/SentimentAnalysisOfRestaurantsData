I wanted to watch the Sunday afternoon NFL game without the noise of a sports bar. I was seated in the restaurant and found the prices to be more than I wanted to pay for dinner ($15-$25), but was allowed to order off of the bar and grill menu while also enjoying the restaurant salad bar. Nice combination!\n\nThe salad bar is a little higher than basic, but fresh and well stocked. The $10 cheese steak sandwhich had a large portion of meat and cheese with more onion rings than I could eat, served with horseradish, lettuce, tomattoes, pickles, etc. It was a very generous portion for the money. \n\nGenerally I do not go to a motel restaurant and/or bar and grill. Because I stayed at the Ramada, I gave this a try. Glad I did and will return when in Casper.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2013-11-24T16:37:09-0500", "location_id": "4866185", "id": "185744388", "user": {"username": "Hiddenshutter", "user_location": {"name": "Monument, Colorado", "id": "33560"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "Great wings", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60437-d4866185-r179105953-m11068-Duke_s_Eatery_and_Bar-Casper_Wyoming.html#review179105953", "text": "The happy hour featured fifty cent wings, and half priced sides., I ordered 12 wings, and a plate of sweet potato fries.
