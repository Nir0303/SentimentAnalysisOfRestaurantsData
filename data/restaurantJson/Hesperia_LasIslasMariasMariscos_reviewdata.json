It's good. The food is tasty. My absolute biggest problem is that they do not de-vein the shrimp ( since of course they're precooked) I also offered the waitress extra money to have my shrimp cleaned properly her answer was, \"No\".  I do love their salsa and their shrimp empanadas are killer great fish tostadas. This was my regular spot for shrimp cocktails ( I've recently found an excellent spot, another review ) This place is also no alcohol. \n\nA huge setback is the staff . The gals are not polite you almost feel like they're being bothered when you ask them for a straw !! If you want a refill or extra lemons be prepared for the huffing and puffing.\n\n Also a very clean place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-09-02T13:56:45-0400", "location_id": "4613708", "id": "226473593", "user": {"username": "marinatilly", "user_location": {"name": "Victorville, California", "id": "33224"}}}, {"lang": "es", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Mala comida, mala atencion", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32491-d4613708-r391207934-m11068-Las_Islas_Marias_Mariscos-Hesperia_California.html#review391207934", "text": "Definitivamente no merece la pena este restaurante!
