After reading yelp comments, etc. I decided to try Master Donuts and what a wonderful location.  The counter staff was so courteous, helpful and friendly.  I did not actually taste any of their items, but based upon the number of diners in the shop and the number of customers who took coffee, donuts, etc. to go was amazing.  Obviously the menu stock is sold out quickly and, thus, quite fresh.  It is a very bright and clean shop with easy parking.  Will have to try a sample or two of their menu items soon.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-03T08:07:57-0500", "location_id": "8782690", "id": "324177679", "user": {"username": "DianeH7050", "user_location": {"name": "Citrus Heights, California", "id": "32212"}}}]}
