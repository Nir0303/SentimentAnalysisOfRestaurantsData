We had the Sinbad combo, which was plenty for the two of us.  The falafel were really delicious and they aren't something either of us had been especially fond of before.  The chicken and beef were also very tasty, and we loved the sauce that came with the dish.  The meal was served on a bed of seasoned rice with peas and other veggies, and with a couple pieces of puffy bread.  The meal also came with a bowl of soup.  We had the lentil soup, which we both enjoyed.  There were several other soups to choose from, our only regret is that we didn't get to try some of the others.\n\nAfter our meal we chatted with the owner (we assume) for a while, and that was very nice.\n\nThe only reason we didn't it 5 stars is that things were a little slow, but there was a sign on the door they were looking for wait staff.  So for the near term you might want  to be a little little patient, as the short wait will be worth it.
