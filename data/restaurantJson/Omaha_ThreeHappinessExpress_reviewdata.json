Service is prompt and friendly.  Entrees are freshly-prepared, therefore they are hot, veggies remain crisp, and seasonings are great.  Have had great seafood, chicken and meat dishes and have not been disappointed.  Heartily recommend this place.   If you're going to be coming in with a group, it's best to give them a heads-up so a table can be saved.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-15T08:47:45-0400", "location_id": "402571", "id": "222007759", "user": {"username": "DEPOmaha", "user_location": {"name": "Omaha, Nebraska", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Best food,best value", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60885-d402571-r221864571-m11068-Three_Happiness_Express-Omaha_Nebraska.html#review221864571", "text": "We have been eating here since it opened!
