While on the main street through town, Kinnaree is a bit hard to spot. The food was excellent...  Fresh and very flavorful!! The service was amazing. Very kind, accomodating, and welcoming employees!  It's a very small and quiet restaurant and I would absolutely return if I ever get the chance!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2010-09-17T21:35:38-0400", "location_id": "865906", "id": "79985077", "user": {"username": "OceanSass", "user_location": {"name": "Valrico", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great Thai find..", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32679-d865906-r20305998-m11068-Kinnaree_Thai_Cuisine-Manteca_California.html#review20305998", "text": "visiting the area, enjoyed lunch several times at this restaurant.
