From the minute you step into the restaurant you will be greeted with a hearty \"hello!\" and \"what can we get started for you?\". The thing that makes this Qdoba stand above other \"assembly line\" type restaurants is that these guys actually LISTEN to what you are ordering and don't make you feel rushed or seem annoyed when you have special requests. I have also appreciated that there doesn't seem to be a high turn over rate among employees. I see a similar lunch crew month after month and it's obvious they value their work. Additionally, in contrast to, say, a place like Chipotle, Qdoba has free extras. Love guacamole? It's FREE a HUGE whoppin' scoop of it too! Love extra fajita veggies? Free, and the extra scoop goes on with a smile. Need your queso on the side? No problem! and \"would you like to try our new chipotle queso while you're here?\" This crew is simply awesome and my husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed our lunch dates here. For family dinners out it has easily become our default. It helps that they also now have a reward program for things like free entrees and free chips and salsa.
