It was very good, but came with a salad which was rather bizarre for breakfast.  Nice little place, but they could use more staff as apparently there was only one man working who took orders and also prepared them!  I did think it was rather pricey for what we got.  But, I'd like to see what happens after they have some time to work things out.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-03-27T05:43:49-0400", "location_id": "6355800", "id": "198891398", "user": {"username": "Massdane", "user_location": {"name": "Fayetteville, Arkansas", "id": "31589"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-02", "title": "Intimate and delicious", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31589-d6355800-r194667114-m11068-Bouchee_Bistro-Fayetteville_Arkansas.html#review194667114", "text": "Saw a review of this little caf\u00e9 in a magazine in our hotel room.  We planned on eating brunch there on Saturday morning, but we didn't arrive until noon.  The cinnamon rolls were gone.  That was our main reason for going.  But, we stayed anyway and ordered French onion soup, Kale quiche, ham and cheese croissant, and a ham sandwich with a fried egg on top.  I don't remember what it was called.  Everything was delicious.  The bread on the sandwich was toasted and buttery and warm. The cheese on the soup was creamy, stringy and had little burn marks - perfect!  The broth was hot and there were lots of onions in the bowl.  The kale quiche was also very, very good.  Brown on the top, but soft, eggy, creamy inside.  The quiche and the sandwich came with a small salad that was also very good.  The caf\u00e9 is very small and has tiny tables.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-02-19T11:51:41-0500", "location_id": "6355800", "id": "194667114", "user": {"username": "blessings", "user_location": {"name": "Tomball, Texas", "id": null}}}]}
