On Friday, well, maybe last friday, I went to a utopia in Bridgeport. A local Brazilian Steakhouse!\n\nNow, I did not know what to expect, which made it an even bigger surprise when I walked in. Well, first, let me tell you a story. It was in Mid-February, we had just gotten back from a long skiing trip. I saw that the next country was Brazil, and I immediately wanted to go to a Brazilian Steakhouse! At first I wanted to go to one right across from MoMA, but, with a little help from my mom, I learned what the experience would be like;\n\n\"Va! Va! Vere Vrom Brazil! Va! Va!\"\n\n\"That's not a Brazilian accent. I think that's a Romanian-\"\n\n\"Listen, you little kid. Either enjoy the experience or get out! I would appreciate the latter!\"\n\nSo instead, we went to a local Brazilian Steakhouse. Well, first we accidentally to another one. There was practically no one there. When we went in, it went downhill. \"Call Me Maybe\" was blasting as a blurry flatscreen TV showed Brazilian SportsCenter (Yes, that's a thing). And, the closest thing to steak was a chicken stew. So we left.\n\nWe then found the right Brazilian Steakhouse, WHICH WAS A BLOCK AWAY! I mean, really? Anyways, as soon as we got out of the car, we smelled the amazing smell of BBQ. I knew that this was the right place. The place was buzzing, people ordering food, playing pool, and having a good time. We got a plate and moved down the large buffet, getting some rice, to the meat guy.\n\nHe took a mouthwatering slice of meat of a kebab and chopped it into perfect pieces. We got a beverage, paid, and sat down. Here is what was on my plate, I am not exaggerating.\n\nThe steak was great, the rice was a nice add on, and this is proof that you can't mess up sausage. It was as good, if not better, than the cevapi. Yes, this place was great. But that's not all. I got tres leches cake while my dad got a corn pudding. All of us thought the desserts were delicious, including Will, who got a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, but with ice cream in the middle.\n\nOverall, this restaurant was great, I recommend you go there! That's all I have to say!
