Good concept but the guide needs to be more accommodating, laid back and fun.  We had Bradley.  His demeanor from the beginning of the ride was much to be desired.  We understood the rules and adhered to them.  Bradley did not smile the entire time.  When we stopped he stood with his arms crossed like we were bothering him and wasting his time.\n\nI understand that a group that is drinking is probably not the most fun to be around when you are sober, but you ARE the guide.  \n\nFrom the time we got on the bike until it ended, Bradley acted arrogant, like we were wasting his time, not very friendly nor accommodating.  We understood there were rules and so this review has nothing to do with the rules and following them.\n\nYou would think that The Biker Bar could have better guides that will help you enjoy your experience or maybe crack a smile or laugh at any point during the 2 hr ride.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-31T08:31:31-0400", "location_id": "8615918", "id": "433267311", "user": {"username": "jsh2020", "user_location": {"name": "Durham, North Carolina", "id": "49092"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Besties 40th", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49092-d8615918-r337900473-m11068-Biker_Bar_NC-Durham_North_Carolina.html#review337900473", "text": "Although she doesn\u2019t  remember much about the evening  she had a great time and so did my husband and I.
