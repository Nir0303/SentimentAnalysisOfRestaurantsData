Having chosen the \"P.I.'s Office,\" upon arrival we were given brief instructions by the proprietors and then locked in the room with other individuals for the activity.  Without any spoilers, the experience was essentially a one-room scavenger hunt, with clues leading to other clues and eventually the door key that allowed us to exit the room.\n\nOn the positive side, this was our first \"escape room\" type of experience and it was unlike anything else we'd ever done before.  It was thrilling and fun without being scary, and trying to work together with a group of strangers to solve puzzles added an extra layer of complexity.  The couple running the business were extraordinarily friendly and eager to discuss both the puzzles and the overall operation.\n\nThat being said, they also have room for improvement.  The audio equipment that is occasionally used to pipe clues into the room while the game is running is sub-par;\nmost of the time we found these clues to be inaudible.  We also anticipated a game that would include more logical problem solving and/or use of trivia-type questions; the game we experienced was almost solely a search for hidden objects/information, making success a somewhat random proposition.\n\nNevertheless, we had a very good time, and would not hesitate to return to try the other escape room offering at this location.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-24T08:23:51-0400", "location_id": "10376252", "id": "431231788", "user": {"username": "Constructive_Summer", "user_location": {"name": "Trumbull, Connecticut", "id": "33951"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Had a blast!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60969-d10376252-r429709390-m11068-Electric_City_Escape-Scranton_Pennsylvania.html#review429709390", "text": "My husband and I did the PI investigation and even though we were total losers, we had so much fun.
