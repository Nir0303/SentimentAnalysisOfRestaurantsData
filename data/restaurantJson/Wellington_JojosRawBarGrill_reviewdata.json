We were there on a Sunday night which happens to be grill night.  They have a large smoker / grill out front.  You can order a steak by the ounce and they grill it there for you.  Though we didn't get steaks, we ordered the smoked wings as an appetizer. They were great!!! Nice size chicken wings smoked but not too smokey.  \n\nMy cousin ordered the blackened shrimp.  She said they were cooked to perfection.  The other guest ordered the macaroni and cheese.  She said it was the best Mac n cheese she ever ate.  I personally ordered the Maryland style crab cakes.  Originally from Maryland and a self proclaimed pro of crab cakes - this was no where near Maryland crab cakes.  They were specks of jumbo lump crab meat, but the majority was filler.  \n\nOn a more positive note, the waiter was fabulous.  He knew the menu so well and stressed how everything was homemade including the salad dressings. He even told us that Wednesday's are bingo night and they have trivia night too\n\nOverall, this place has very good food ...prices are good and service wS excellent ", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-01T10:22:58-0400", "location_id": "4790077", "id": "369295460", "user": {"username": "BaltimoreMOMof1", "user_location": {"name": "Delray Beach, Florida", "id": "34179"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Good!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34727-d4790077-r365789341-m11068-Jojo_s_Raw_Bar_Grill-Wellington_Florida.html#review365789341", "text": "Very good!
