What a great way to get acquainted with the city, especially all the local eating and shopping establishments.  CJ of Wilcox Travel, walked us down a few of the main streets in town and pointed out some interesting historical facts about the city.  However, the tour mostly focused on the local culinary scene, which is extensive in Asheville!  I went to a few of the places CJ pointed out, and they were all great.  I even got a discount when I mentioned that I had taken the tour.  One nice thing about Asheville is that most of the restaurants and shops in the downtown area are locally owned, so you will get a unique dining and shopping experience.
