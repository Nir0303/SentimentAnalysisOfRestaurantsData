We arrived early to avoid the majority of the Sunday rush.  When we arrived there were a few people waiting. I went to the reception area and she wouldn't look at us. Finally I asked if we could put our name on the list and she reluctantly said that sure, we could. We put our name in and waited. After seeing numerous parties ahead of us get seated we approached the podium and noticed our name had been crossed off.  We asked why and she stated they started a new list, but we weren't added to that list. The hostess mentioned they would clear off a booth for us. After 15 more minutes of waiting and seeing others seated, we asked again if our name was on the list and she asked us who we were, again!  After explaining she threw her hands in the air and said \"fine\" and walked us to our booth. Rude, unfriendly service. We did get a chance to talk to Omar, the general manager, who could not have cared less, and didn't even acknowledge their issues. Other patrons were in this same situation and we talked amongst ourselves while we just had to laugh at the complete lack of care. We will never return, and I doubt many of the other customers will either.

We chose to forgo the breakfast/lunch buffet as that didn't look to appealing at 1 pm. After a long wait for our food( mind you the \"church rush\" was over )  we got our meals. The chili was the soup of the day and was cold,not even luke warm . Tasted like it came straight out of the can. The mashed potatoes on the 3 meals that came with them we also cold, we asked the serve to warm them up and the manager brought out 2 small bowls of mashed potatoes and gravy which was odd because those potatoes were cold too but the gravy was warm. The tird guest did not get any new potatoes as the figured 2 must have been good enough.  Not once did our server come by to ask how everything was nor to refill our drinks. I sat with an empty glass through most of my meal . Only when she offered to bring the check did she ask about refills .. I understand this is a family owned place but with such poor service and cold food when the dining room was half empty , I couldn't recommend this place to anyone. The only time i even saw a manager was when she brought out the \"hot\" mashed potatoes. so I could not tell her how my experience was.
