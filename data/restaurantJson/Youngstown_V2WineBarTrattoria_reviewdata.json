Our waiter was very friendly.  They have a nice beer and wine selection.  Wish they would add Red Bridge which is a gluten-free beer.  We both had burgers (three meats ground together).  They were delicious.  We also had the arancini....excellent!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-02-10T13:35:38-0500", "location_id": "2394864", "id": "253595102", "user": {"username": "3CtheUSA", "user_location": {"name": "Youngstown, Ohio", "id": "51184"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "ok happy hour place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51184-d2394864-r249462654-m11068-V2_Wine_Bar_Trattoria-Youngstown_Ohio.html#review249462654", "text": "I had one of the pizza's which was alright.
