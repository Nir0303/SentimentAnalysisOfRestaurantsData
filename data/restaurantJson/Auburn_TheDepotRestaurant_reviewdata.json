The price is midrange, but the food is top notch (hence I gave the 5/5.)  We went on a Thursday at lunch, had great service.  The inside is fun to look at with the train and nautical themes.  It is nice enough for a date to impress and informal enough to go with your family.  I can't wait to go back and try osso bucco to see if they will still keep my 5/5 rating.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-27T19:48:16-0400", "location_id": "8657597", "id": "423001851", "user": {"username": "ahabaito", "user_location": {"name": "Auburn, California", "id": "29120"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Not the greatest seafood, but good for Auburn", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29006-d8657597-r420665274-m11068-The_Depot_Restaurant-Auburn_Alabama.html#review420665274", "text": "The Depot offers a peaceful Saturday morning brunch away from the crowded restaurants and hour-long waits on game day at Auburn University. The menu is creative and reasonably priced, the service is phenomenal, and the ambiance is incredibly charming.\n\nAuburn's train station built in 1904 was extensively remodeled and reopened as The Depot Restaurant during the summer of 2016. The interior design fuses modern opulence with the preservation of historic aspects of the original train station, including the most marvelous chandelier, original fireplace and towering ceilings.\n\nThe menu is intriguing and concocted by California chef Scott Simpson. Certainly nobody is doing high brow seafood in this part of Alabama like The Depot.\n\nThe crab dip appetizer was perfectly spicy with well-balanced flavors and ample crab meat, although I hoped for a few large pieces of crab. The dip was topped with a delectable Mexican sausage and came with deliciously crafted chips. The amberjack was flaky and tender but the outer edges were a little tough and dry.\n\nThe gumbo was the only disappointment here. I've tasted a vast variety of this dish in so many places, especially in Louisiana where its authenticity is unmatched! While I appreciated the okra and occasional lumps of crawfish, shrimp, and Andouille, it was more of a liquid soup than a solid stew, with far too much broth that comes off as incredibly strong and overpowering. It's simply not gumbo and it has all the wrong flavors with not enough meat.\n\nThis is a pleasant stop on your way to the Auburn campus and worth a visit. The food just needs some tweaking. I'll try the wide variety of oysters next time and post an update.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-20T14:49:32-0400", "location_id": "8657597", "id": "420665274", "user": {"username": "PeteDeborahWade", "user_location": {"name": "Brentwood, Tennessee", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Huge Thanks for a big group of VERY happy diners.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29006-d8657597-r419910645-m11068-The_Depot_Restaurant-Auburn_Alabama.html#review419910645", "text": "Our group has been gathering for dinner every Friday night before a home game for several years.
