The store was clean, bright and cheerful. It had a self serve coffee bar that was AWESOME; a soft-serve frozen yogurt bar; fresh Danish; and full supply of food, drinks and even fresh fruits.

In order to purchase ice, you have to get a clerk to come outside and unlock it...  besides being inconvenient to both the customer and the clerk, it doesn't appear to be smart, particularly here in hot Texas. They do have great ice - better than QuickTrip's ice. I asked the guy to bring it into the store and when I paid for it, I noticed it had been left on the floor by the door. Just not the best vibe - certainly not as nice as the previous staff who worked this store so well.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-02-21T18:51:23-0500", "location_id": "9975913", "id": "349844476", "user": {"username": "Travel4Bizz", "user_location": {"name": "McKinney, Texas", "id": "56260"}}}]}
