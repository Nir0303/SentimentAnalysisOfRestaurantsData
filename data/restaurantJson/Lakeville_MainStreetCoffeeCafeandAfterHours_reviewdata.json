The Cafe is open during the day, and on the other side of the building, the Wine Bar is open at night.  The same owner and same kitchen are involved for both.  We really like small local establishments, and this one is overlooked too often, because there isn't much going on downtown Lakeville at night.  If you are considering the Lakeville area for coffe, a light meal, or cocktail time, don't forget this is easy to get to on main street downtown, with plenty of parking, and the quality is high.  In the summer they have a great patio area.\n\nThe wine bar has a good selection of wine and beer.  There are many snacks, salads, and sandwiches available if you like.  On our last visit we had two beers (a microbrew Porter from Wisconsin and an Amber Ale from Colorado) , Hot Southern Peanuts, Blue Chips (kettle chips with chunky blue cheese dressing for dipping), and Warmed Olives (5 different types of olives).  Be careful with the Blue Chips - they are addictive - hard to stop eating!  The olives are really good too.  The total was right about $20 with tip included.  \n\nThe ambience is nice - it is a cozy little place that is usually quiet.  Good for \"date night\" with your spouse, or a small gathering of friends for Happy Hour, or after dinner.  Or if you just want something light, you can go there for dinner.  I've had the artichoke dip, flatbread, and sandwiches before, and they are all good.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-11-21T09:43:30-0500", "location_id": "2400506", "id": "120873113", "user": {"username": "Kathryn_in_MN", "user_location": {"name": "Minnesota, USA", "id": null}}}]}
