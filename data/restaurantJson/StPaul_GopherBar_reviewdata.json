What place can make me feel like eating Coney's? A tiny little hole-in-the-wall called the Gopher Bar in downtown St. Paul and a place not for the faint of heart. \n\nYou will need some thick skin to enter the Gopher Bar and if you're easily offended, the Gopher Bar should be on your skip list. For instance, their shirt has a saying on the back that I will refrain from posting here and the menu provides you with instructions on how to order your Coney; Sit Down! Shut Up & Wait Your Turn!. Well, that's exactly what my wife and I did as we were laughing at all the funny signs they have hanging up that yes, would offend some people. \n\nIt's definitely a place you would find Billy Idol in and if you can get past their unique (to say the least) marketing, they are serving an outstanding Coney Island hot dog that you should try yourself. Two ways to order them up, with cheese and without - pretty simple and straight forward. I went with cheese while my wife went without and they pile on the chili and onions and pile on they indeed do! I love hot sauce and noticed a bottle of delicious Sriracha just looking at me and telling me to put it on my Coney, so I obliged. I used to eat Coney's growing up doing youth hockey fundraisers and they were never this good!  The chili was awesome, as you bite into the dogs, they had a nice snap to them (as they should) and the buns were grilled nicely as well. \n\nAll-in-all, these things were awesome and I would recommend adding a little Sriracha to it, it makes everything that much better. The Gopher Bar is a simple place, they only accept cash and they don't take crap from anyone and they're not afraid to let you have it if you're acting out of line. They have some other items on the menu, 11 to be exact, but the Coney is what you should be going here for any ways. While you're there, you might as well stay and have a few adult beverages as well. Just be nice to your bartender, even toilets can only handle one _____ at a time! Yes, that's actually a sign behind the bar!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-07-16T06:54:28-0400", "location_id": "474803", "id": "215711017", "user": {"username": "NicholasSG", "user_location": {"name": "Rosemount, Minnesota", "id": "43476"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-11", "title": "Love the flags", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43501-d474803-r196692488-m11068-Gopher_Bar-Saint_Paul_Minnesota.html#review196692488", "text": "The food here is marginal . They will have either PBR or Old Style on tap which I enjoy. The prices are fair but not cheap. As others have posted this place is a dive but that is what makes it a great place to go,unless you are a thin skinned Mn liberal. The Confederate flags add a bit of intimidating charm. The bathrooms disgusting and probably meant to be that way. If you catch George, the owner in a good mood ( tough to do) he will put a bottle on the bar and drink it with you like in the old west. His wife Cheri is a hoot and about as foul mouthed as possible. Many have stated that this place is racist and maybe so but liberals hate George because he cannot be forced to accept their doctrine. I have never seen him treat a person of color badly regardless of his personal beliefs. Liberals love to pass laws to make you agree with them and George could not care less. Bring cash as that is all they accept . Try to rob the place and you will likely regret it. (Enough said) . This is not a place for kids in my opinion.
