Several tables for 2 and 4 are available and I've heard they have seating outside when it's warm enough. \nI went for a  House Burger, 1/3 pound, fresh and hand formed along with cajun fries cut on site. The burger was very well prepared and juicy to bite into. The fries were just the way I like them and accompanied by a great chipotle ranch dipping sauce (though you'll need more than one container). I look forward to trying their other burgers. Being a big hot dog fan, I got a classic to go...yellow mustard, onions and their meat sauce. I've never been a big fan of anyone's meat sauce and the same was true here. Not to say that others won't like it...it just not my thing. Also, the dogs have a casing which is also not my preference.

I've tried almost everything on the menu, and it's all good! Fresh cut fries, juicy burgers and cold beer to go with anything they serve.  Try the 'Salty Balls', salt brined golden potatoes-they melt in your mouth, and are a healthier alternative.  They also serve Avery's Soda, which had made right in New Britain for years! It's a cute place, and very nice owners!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-09T08:18:09-0500", "location_id": "7251329", "id": "331640908", "user": {"username": "jenc1076", "user_location": {"name": "Hartford, Connecticut", "id": "33804"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Great Hot Dogs!!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33847-d7251329-r323869124-m11068-Riley_s_Hot_Dog_Burger_Gourmet-New_Britain_Connecticut.html#review323869124", "text": "Saw an article in the local newspaper.
