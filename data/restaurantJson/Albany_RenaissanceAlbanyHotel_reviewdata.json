The food was quite good, but  the service was a little slow for a business hotel.   Also had drinks one evening and during the week they offer a different free signature cocktail each evening, complete with a brief presentation about what is in it.  Fun idea.\n\nThey also offer a free transfer to the Albany train station, which is about 10 minutes from the hotel.\n\nThe hotel looks out over the state capitol building and couldn't be more conveniently located for business with the state.\n\nI look forward to a return visit.
