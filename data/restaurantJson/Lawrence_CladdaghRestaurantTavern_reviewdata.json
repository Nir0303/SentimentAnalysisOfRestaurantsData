The pizza is always good, hand tossed and not too sweet, but I had a craving for a burger and my friend wanted to try the fish and chips (I always rave about it). \n\nThe staff recommendation was the Jameson Burger and was very surprised at the quality, it was fresh, well cooked and had the perfect blend of flavors.  The Jameson Whiskey BBQ sauce was not overpowering and just enough was used to give it the perfect flavor. I'm a stickler for the right bun on a burger and again they didn't disappoint me, the soft but crispy sourdough bun was a perfect bread for this burger. For a side dish I opted for the onion rings and again it proved the right choice, fresh homemade thin string onion rings made in classic New England style, for a minute I thought I was at a seafood restaurant the rings were so good.\n\nMy Friend was quiet for a change, well until I stole some of her fish and chips, then I understood why, it was also perfect,  the fish and the batter were both fresh and the right amount of batter was on the fish. Also you could see from both the fish and the handout homemade french fries that the oil was also fresh.\n\nI was great to go somewhere, get real french fries and onion rings (not frozen machine manufactured crap), fresh fish hand battered and a handmade burger cooked to perfection.\n\nAs people that read my reviews here and on Facebook know, when I like something it must be good, this was not good, it was perfect. I won't hesitate on going here again when I want good pub food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-13T18:01:00-0500", "location_id": "900489", "id": "339812723", "user": {"username": "Paul M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Great People Great Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41635-d900489-r326332552-m11068-Claddagh_Restaurant_Tavern-Lawrence_Massachusetts.html#review326332552", "text": "I wanted there with a few friends and the wait staff is good and they are very friendly.
