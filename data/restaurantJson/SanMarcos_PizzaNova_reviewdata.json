Try their white sangria laced with Cointreau and Amaretto liquors @$10.00.\nExtensive menu with plenty of choices from overstuffed meatball sandwich to open oven baked pizza. Pizza crust perfect but the sliced red tomatoes were under ripe pale pink and lacked flavor and necessary color for to make it a winner. Better luck next time?\nCreme Brulee full of vanilla bean flavor and \"crust\" cooked to delicious goodness.\nGood for lunch and dinner.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-18T11:06:28-0500", "location_id": "4252207", "id": "249898655", "user": {"username": "JustinaTucson", "user_location": {"name": "Escondido, California", "id": "32358"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "My Favorite Restaurant in North County", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33028-d4252207-r248718886-m11068-Pizza_Nova-San_Marcos_California.html#review248718886", "text": "I enjoy coming to Pizza Nova for lunch. Their service is typically quick and the servers are presentable, professional, and friendly. I almost always the the Spicy Chicken Wrap and although the pasta salad is yummy, I usually end up getting fruit so that I can eat some garlic balls without feeling like a total fatty. I don't really like pizza, but my husband has enjoyed the pizza here quite a few times. I keep coming back again and again, it's basically to the point that I crave this amazing chicken wrap. I definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner, it's always awesome.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-10T20:05:36-0500", "location_id": "4252207", "id": "248718886", "user": {"username": "CatLady36", "user_location": {"name": "Vista, CA", "id": null}}}]}
