It was a quiet place, all decorated with Thai statues, flowers and oriental pictures.  There was a row of booths and then open tables and chairs.  We opt for booth instead.\n\nIt was Tuesday and there was a lunch box special for about $8 with drinks. Anything else would be add on.  For example, fried rice with egg would be two dollars more. We submitted our order.  It came quickly like the Japanese Bento lunch box.\n\nThe fried fish and steak orders were just right.  We were satisfied with the food and good service.  The place open from 11:00 am to 10:00 pm, from Sunday to Thursday.\n\nThai Purple is located on 27 North Garfield Avenue, in downtown Alhambra, California (626) 300-9083.   \n\nIf one is ever in this part of town, drop by Thai Purple.

The noodles were mushy, very sweet, chicken pieces of low quality, and shrimp was not fresh. Only thing fresh was the green onions. Ordered the yellow curry and it tasted like chemicals had been added. Could hardly tasted the curry or  coconut milk and spicy. I had asked for spicy. I added condiments hoping to improve the taste but unsuccessful. There was more soup than contents. Ordered Jasmine tea which is made with loose tea. Noone asked if I needed more water. Had to wait quite awhile for check. Pad Thai not 3.99, is now 4.99, not worth it. Curry was about 8.00.  Could't eat  much of the food so took leftovers home for my dog. I hadn't been to this restaurant for about 5 years when my grown daughter brought me.  Food was better then. I will not go back again. Just was convenient because I was in the area.
