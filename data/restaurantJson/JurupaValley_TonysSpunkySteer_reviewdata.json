It was nasty nacho cheese on my steak, so I asked the waitress to get me a new steak, not an unreasonable request since I want steak sauce on my steak not cheese. Well I got extreme attitude so at that point we decided we were done there and would not be eating. \n\nI go to the front to complain, not only about the cheese but mostly about the nasty attitude Danielle the waitress gave me for not just accepting my cheese steak and asking for a new one. Instead of getting a chance to voice my annoyance I get the cashier charge me $6.47 for my drinks! The same drinks that were spilled all over the table by the busser and waitress. So we pay for our drinks and leave. I call later and ask for the manager. The same cashier said that they were working the floor and couldn't take my call. \n\nSo I'm out $6.47 and have a ruined night because I didn't accept the nasty food that was sent to my table! I've been coming here since I was a kid when we lived in Mira Loma and this was called Steer and Stein but I will never, ever, ever come back.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-12-09T18:33:41-0500", "location_id": "468688", "id": "147097624", "user": {"username": "Emily E", "user_location": {"name": "Redlands, California", "id": "32953"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2012-11", "title": "Don't Bother", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32978-d468688-r146507513-m11068-Tony_s_Spunky_Steer-Riverside_California.html#review146507513", "text": "Looked and smelled great, no flavor, dry meat.
