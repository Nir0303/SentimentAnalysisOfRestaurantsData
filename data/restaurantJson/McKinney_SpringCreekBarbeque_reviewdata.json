Every location we've visited has been well-maintained, staff members have welcomed us, and food has been dependably good.\n\nThis location is not quite on par with others. The staff was very friendly, and facilities were among the cleanest we've seen, but with a few exceptions the food was average.\n\nGetting there -\n\nWe saw the Spring Creek sign while driving southbound on US 75...too late to switch lanes on the congested thoroughfare. However, we really wanted to eat at this restaurant, so we continued several miles south to the next exit, backtracked to US 380, then worked our way through retail parking lots. The time was about 7:00 p.m., well after sunset in January, and the glare of lights made navigating road construction difficult.\n\nLocal residents probably don't have this kind of trouble getting there, but travelers could experience difficulty like we did.\n\nOutside/Inside -\n\nThe facility is exceptionally well-maintained. The parking lot and exterior were well lighted. We saw no trash on the pavement or in landscaping. The interior, from the serving area to the dining room to bathrooms, was also in outstanding condition. Floors, glass and tabletops were smudge-free. The restroom was well-stocked and clean.\n\nSuperior service -\n\nLine workers had great \"counterside\" manner. They made us feel special with their warm greeting and attentive service. In typical Spring Creek fashion, they sang ad lib songs about the type of meat we ordered, and were amused when we contributed a chorus to their tune. We felt our patronage was appreciated.\n\nA server came by our table twice to offer freshly-baked rolls. She was very nice when we accepted the first time, and equally nice when we refused the second. When asked for a take-away box, the staff responded kindly and quickly. \n\nOverall, I'd rate service here in the top 10% of places we've ever eaten.\n\nFood findings -\n\nMy wife and I both ordered smoked turkey, but chose different sides. Portions were generous...I had leftover turkey and rolls for lunch twice the week after our visit.\n\nThe turkey was alright...not the best we've had, but far from the worst. Their fresh rolls were excellent. Other food items varied from good to below average. \n\nMacaroni and cheese scored highly, as did the pinto beans. Conversely, the green beans, despite all the bacon in them, had little flavor. The corn cob also lacked luster. My wife speculated it'd been sitting in water too long. Both beans and corn would benefit from additional seasoning. \n\nThe Bottom Line -\n\nI wanted to rate this restaurant higher because they did many things well. Their service is top-notch, a real plus. The building is clean and comfortable. However, food taste and consistency are lacking...and food is the primary reason people go to a restaurant.\n\nWith a little work, their food quality can match that of other Spring Creek locations. I hope they make the effort to improve.
