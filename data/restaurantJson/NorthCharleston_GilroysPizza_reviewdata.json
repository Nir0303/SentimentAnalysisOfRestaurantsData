It is an establishment that has some seriously questionable practices and ethics. Shortly after I over paid for a horrible pizza pie, a bunch of very young women went into the kitchen to flash the staff and get free pizza. This place is a disgrace and there were girls in and out of the kitchen. If women flash themselves in the kitchen, I wouldn't be surprised if men do the same. It is disgusting and unsanitary. Plus the pizza is horrible, if I were in Charleston longer I would probably report this sad excuse for a food establishment.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2012-02-08T16:26:36-0500", "location_id": "864763", "id": "124322771", "user": {"username": "Almost_lover", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": null, "title": "Avoid!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54370-d864763-r123803453-m11068-Gilroy_s_Pizza-North_Charleston_South_Carolina.html#review123803453", "text": "Ordered late night snack while staying at hotel.
