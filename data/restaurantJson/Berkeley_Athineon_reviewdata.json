Seating limited to perhaps 10 tables. There appeared to be more tables in the back of the room. Some for two and the rest for four. Menu is strictly Greek with quite a few offerings for such a small place. The only American dish offered is a hamburger. We ordered at the register and took seats. Our meals, a Gyro and a veggie Falafel, came quickly. Both had good flavor and were served hot. The restaurant does a lot of take out business, so it obviously popular with the locals. Our server came by at least twice the check on us.

The table outside is most likely not worth considering as it is directly on University Avenue, the most busy Berkeley street with public buses and a lot of delivery trucks.
