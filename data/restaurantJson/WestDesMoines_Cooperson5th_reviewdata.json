The have a nice selection of wines and generous well made cocktails. We visit West Des Moines frequently and have never been disappointed with Cooper's.

There was 4 of us.  Very cute little restaurant.  Had the special egg rolls, they were Monte Cristo and really good.  Small size, a little caf\u00e9 / diner type food, a little upscale from typical though. The hot german potato salad I loved, two of us loved it, one did not. It was very good. Meatloaf sandwich one person got, was very good also.  Drinks, beer available. A cute place to take parents or adult kids to for lunch or dinner, not to expensive, for four of us, with the egg roll appetizer and one bread pudding dessert, and 4 entrees, one beer, was around 75.00.  Josh was our server and it was great how he explained the egg rolls, the hot potato salad, he was an excellent server.  We are from out of town, but if we lived there we would definitely go a couple times a month. The dessert was excellent, could maybe of used a little more sauce, as usually the bread pudding is served with sauce poured over it also right before serving, it was not dry, it was very good, it would of just been excellent with a little more sauce on top.  Anyway, that's my viewpoint!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-09T19:22:56-0500", "location_id": "3625389", "id": "331729015", "user": {"username": "B B", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Hidden Gem!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g38519-d3625389-r330878924-m11068-Cooper_s_on_5th-West_Des_Moines_Iowa.html#review330878924", "text": "While in Des Moines for the weekend we stumbled upon Coopers on 5th.
