San Leandro is noted for having a number of \"old school\" shopping malls, such as Pelton Center (location of Taqueria Los Pericos), Palma Plaza (also on East 14th Street), and the Marina Mart shopping center located at the intersection Marina and Doolittle.   Thus, my first reason for liking Los Pericos, is that it is located in an \"old school\" shopping center, where glitzy franchise businesses are in a distinct minority.  Please note that I went to middle school at John Muir Junior High School and, after that, to Pacific High School, during the 1960s.\n\nDECOR.  Los Pericos is distinguished by its mural with paintings of about 40 parrots, which wraps around the room.  The mural is quite colorful, and the artwork is of professional quality.  Some of the birds seem partially hidden behind the painted foliage, and thus it is amusing to try to count the number of birds, because each time you count, you get a different answer.  There are three models (sculptures) of parrots, and these sit on swings that are mounted on the ceiling.  There is a centrally-located buffet table, which has traditional condiments, that is, marinated carrots, onions, sliced jalapenos, salsa, and so on.  There is also modern flat screen television mounted high on the wall, and tuned to a Spanish-language channel.  Although I only know two or three words of Spanish, I do like the fact that the T.V. is tuned to a Spanish channel.  There are also two electronic video games, Fast and Furious Drift, and Street Fighter II.  \n\nTHE CUISINE.  The menu has four pages, the first page disclosing \"desayunos\" which includes various omelets and meat/egg combinations.  The second page lists types of meat (pastor, chorizo, pollo, lengua, buche, cabeza), burritos, tacos, and soups.  The third pages lists quesadillas and specialty plates, such as enchilada plate and chile relleno plate.  And the fourth page lists shrimp plates, various meals, and desserts, such as flan and cheesecake.  The menu includes three types of beer.  What I liked best, and what is not listed on the paper menu, were the three types of aguas frescas, namely, horchata, tamarind, and Jamaica flower.  Horchata is a traditional beverage made from ground almonds, sesame seeds, rice.  I asked the waitress what it was, and she answered, \"rice water.\"  I had seconds of the horchata.\n\nTHE GUESTS.  The guests include children, middle aged folks, and old folks.  It was obvious to me, that Los Pericos is not marketing itself to the 20-something crowd.  I liked the fact that a Mexican-American gentleman was seated at the next table, and that he was wearing a cowboy hat and sideburns.  Previously, I'd seen many Mexican-American men during my explorations around the farming community in Mecca, California.  I also liked the fact that a girl at another table nearby was dressed in authentic garb.  Perhaps, it was a Quinceanera suit, or something else.  At any rate, her shirt had a red-colored embroidered eagle on the back, with red-colored embroidered ivy with green trimming in the shape of horse shoes on the sleeves, and she had white boots.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-10-17T11:35:05-0400", "location_id": "4250198", "id": "234914352", "user": {"username": "TomBrody", "user_location": {"name": "Berkeley, California", "id": "32066"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "Muy bueno", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33023-d4250198-r231224310-m11068-Taqueria_Los_Pericos-San_Leandro_California.html#review231224310", "text": "For authentic flavor in Mexican cuisine, Los Pericos is the place in San Leandro.
