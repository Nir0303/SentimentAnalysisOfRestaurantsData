Make sure to make reservations or else you may never even get a table. The Bottomless mimosas are a great deal you can either spend $10 for bottomless till 1pm, or $20 for bottomless till 3pm. IT all depends when you get there and how long you plan to stay. The music that they play brings you back to the 9, its fantastic. One of the best brunch spots you can go to in West Palm.

Elijah was a delightful server--fun, knowledgeable and articulate about the questions we had the various wines we ordered. We asked for some recommendations in specific categories and he always delivered. We came back again and had a similar positive and delightful experience with another server...I think Stephanie was her name. The setting is steam-punkishly beautiful--lots of raw brick and interesting light fixtures. Have had a couple of the small plate items and all were quite good.
