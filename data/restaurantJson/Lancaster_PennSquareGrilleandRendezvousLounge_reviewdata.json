It has never been great...but for an early Sunday morning brunch, there are not many choices nearby. Today, however, the experience sunk to a new low.\n\nWe entered and waited behind another party to be seated. No one came for some time. Finally a server came over and told us someone would soon be over. No one came over. The server finally came over and began to seat us when the proper person arrived...and complained to the server about what gave her the right to seat people. \n\nOur drink orders were taken rapidly and the drinks arrived fairly quickly, we did have to request one item several times before it finally came much later (and it was only water with lemon...and the lemon ended up being a bit...er...spoiled).\n\nWe got the buffet, and waited in a short but long line for omelets. The omelet chef is not ever particularly friendly...today was no exception. In fact, as the person went flipped an omelet and missed a bit, they let loose with some foul language. They ended up being down to one burner, which slowed things farther. By the time my burned omelet was done (burned enough that the omelet person actually took off a piece and threw it out), and I returned to our table, others were just about finished with their breakfast. The omelet person also makes Belgian waffles...however, when getting them out of the waffle maker, he did not use tongs...but picked them up with his hands..which were gloved, but still...\n\nMy son, who decided not to wait in the long line had gone to the remainder of the buffet. He had gotten a danish, only to find a hair in it.\n\nI tried the remainder of the buffet...they were out of scrambled eggs. I got the last few potatoes. Others were looking for basics like butter and couldn't find it.\n\nThe staff is never particularly friendly, and this was true again today.\n\nGiven the ridiculously high price for the buffet, we had about enough. We brought this all to the attention of a manager, who personally apologized to us twice, and who was kind enough to adjust our bill as a recompense. We do very much appreciate his actions, and had it not been for this, the rating would have been lower.\n\nStill, we have given this place several chances, and this was the end of the line. Next time when we in town this early, before places like Annie Bailey's are open for Sunday brunch, we will simply drive to some other part of town for brunch rather than come back here.\n\nIf you are visiting the hotel...try the brunch..try someplace like Annie Bailey's or \"On Orange\" or someplace else.

We ate most of our meals at the Penn Square Grille in the hotel and were pleased with the selection and quality.  All of our breakfasts were at the grille, as were three dinners, including Christmas day.  Breakfast was the fine Marriott buffet we've gotten to know and love, as we are regular Marriott customers.  Included was a new twist on breakfast home fries which we quite enjoyed, and the made to order omlets were perfect!  Turkey dinner on Christmas day was extra special with the wait staff seeing to our every need in holiday fashion. \n\nOther dinners we enjoyed at the grille included an excellent burger (the Penn Square Grille Burger), the speck wrapped pork tenderloin, and the short ribs with butternut squash ravioli.  It's worth noting that the roasted garlic and white bean soup is to die for!\n\nFor most of our meals, our servers, Prastut and Abby, and Camille our hostess, provided exceptional service.

The price of the buffet was $14.95 including juice and coffee.  We ate here the second day mainly for the convenience of our baby and my wife's conference, not for the food.   The buffet was not up to par with most other breakfast buffets that I have enjoyed at Marriott hotel restaurants.   For example the muffins were obviously made from a mix with dried or imitation bluberries, the cleanliness was questionable, the sausage looked like swift premium rather than the nice plump links, the fruit looked like it had been around, the home fries had little taste and never did I get a good morning or any sense of caring or professionalism from the omelette maker.  Also, some of his actions should not have been done in front of the guest like tearing open a plastic bag of goat cheese and squeezing it onto your omelette or grabbing the wafflle with his hand rather than using tongs.   I got the feeling there was no mgmt supervision of the buffet.  \nAside from the food the servers were very friendly and accomodating to us and our baby which we appreciated and the atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant and relaxed.  \nIf you are not going to do a buffet right don't do it at all.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-11-07T17:48:14-0500", "location_id": "2445308", "id": "325155222", "user": {"username": "MrAccurateReview", "user_location": {"name": "Philadelphia, PA", "id": null}}}]}
