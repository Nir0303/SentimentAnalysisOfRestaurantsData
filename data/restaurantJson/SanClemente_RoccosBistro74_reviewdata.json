We were eager to try this new casual dining restaurant, since the chef is so awesome. \n\nThey have specials every night, so we had the $1 street tacos which were OK but not special.  But then, they were only $1. Knowing the chef is so great we ordered the pork belly and bean soup and it was awesome-- very richly flavored with both Italian and Latin American vibe, which is Rocco's signature. The server recommended some regular menu that we'll order next time.\n\nThe dining section lacks ambiance, but the server Jessica was very helpful and energetic.  Parking is easy, under the hotel, which is really nice since it's hard to park near a lot of San Clemente restaurants in the summer.\n\nWarning,  I read it was in the Holiday Inn, but didn't recall that there are two Holiday Inns in town.  This is the one on Avenida De la Estrella and Presidio, near downtown.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-14T20:21:44-0400", "location_id": "8297939", "id": "289032054", "user": {"username": "SC_momma", "user_location": {"name": "Orange County", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "New Venue, Needs a bit of fleshing out", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33012-d8297939-r279334014-m11068-Rocco_s_Bistro_74-San_Clemente_California.html#review279334014", "text": "We went to this restaurant located in the Holiday Inn.  We had heard it was opened by the people who operate Rocco's, a truly spectacular restaurant.  It needs a bit of work.  It is obvious it was opened on a shoestring.  Our lovely server, Jessica, was friendly and helpful but needed a bit more experience.  Everything was very slow as the kitchen staff consisted of just the chef.  The food was to die for.  The Salmon was spectacular and the Chicken Parmigiana was mouth watering.  No complaints on the food.
