Pulled pork was alright but once you put some House BBQ sauce on it, it was so much better.  The best part for me were the ribs and chicken fingers.  The ribs were huge and great with an awesome dry rub and a great smokey flavor.  The chicken fingers are infused with buttermilk so they have a very unique flavor profile.\n\nWhen I get a chicken sandwich I put cheese and usually ketchup on them because, well, I'm a manchild, don't judge me.

They've been open coming onto a year.  When I arrived (around 5 PM), it was about 1/4 to 1/3 full.  The service was great and I decided to try the sampler platter. ($29 - serves 2 - 3 people).  Although the menu is pick and choose, I wanted the convenience of just getting a taste of everything without the piecemeal ordering system!  I knew there would be at least two meals for me and that was just fine!  \n\nEverything meaty was terrific, I had chicken fingers, pulled pork, sausage links, pork ribs on-the-bone.  I had sides of baked beans and french fries and got a corn muffin.  The sides were where I had a few comments.  Baked beans with pork pieces were overly spicy hot.  The \"heat\" overpowered the taste, unfortunately. What a shame!\n\nI swapped the included Cole slaw for the fries (pay up the difference), and when they arrived, I knew I made a mistake.  The bowl of fries was wa-a-a-y too big for me, and a bit cool when served.\n\nNext time, I'm going to take the extra time and effort to order precisely what I want...and no more!  It's so good, and you can easily fall into the trap of overdoing it!\n\nThis place is a great addition to downtown and to Fargo! It's worth the drive to get there from the 'burbs if you're staying on the 13th Ave strip area.\n\nMy only suggestion would be for the mgmt to come up with a balanced plate for one rather than a platter to share!  Currently this is BBQ served in a bar, but I hope it becomes a BBQ restaurant that serves alcohol!  They would attract more visitors and Fargo hasn't had a great BBQ  place for years since a family operation in the Westgate Strip Mall shut down too long ago. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-05-26T15:52:31-0400", "location_id": "9751252", "id": "376891384", "user": {"username": "patchshopper", "user_location": {"name": "Midwest", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Expanded menu", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49785-d9751252-r376248423-m11068-No_Bull-Fargo_North_Dakota.html#review376248423", "text": "On my last visit they had expanded the menu.
