Though a little heavy with deep fried ingredients, flavors meld well for a different and pleasant surprise.  The spice tofu bowl arrives with a mildly spicy Korean style hot sauce that is more sweet and tangy than hot.  Mixed with a few splashes of Sriracha and the sauce generates just enough heat to complement the key flavors of the Korean sauce.\n\nReasonably priced, genuine Korean home cooked atmosphere and food.
