It has an outside patio that allows dogs if you have your canine friend with you.  Appitizers were great as was the pizza.  There is a full bar with TVs if you want to catch up on the game.  It is a comfortable place to have a drink and some good food.  I like that it is a little further away from the pier as it is quieter to sit outside.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-21T10:56:42-0400", "location_id": "2703323", "id": "384663957", "user": {"username": "Jackie W", "user_location": {"name": "Huntington Beach, California", "id": "32513"}}}]}
