I was one of five people and while my companions generally liked the food, I wasn't very impressed at all.\n\nOver the four meals, I ordered:\n\nEuro Goulash -- this is very similar to one of Denny's skillets.  There was nothing special about it, actually.  And why the heck is this even called a goulash?!?  Do they even KNOW what goulash is -- this dish has nothing to do with that name (it's not a soup or stew and doesn't have paprika or veggies or much meat!)...it's like calling a cactus a rose goes they're both plants.  I don't particularly like Denny's but at least they offer the same food at half the price without the silly hype.  Not great.  \n\nHashbrown Casserole -- this didn't seem very different than the goulash.  I wasn't impressed and wouldn't order it again.\n\nSmokehouse -- it was a decent burger but not great.  In fact, the middle was rather undercooked and made me feel a little queesy later.  The sauce was yummy but the price tag was WAY too high for this region.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\nGyro -- this was my last attempt to find something I liked.  I think the gyros you can get in a mall are just as tasty for half the price.  Again, not at all impressed.  And not particularly noteworthy either.\n\nSmoked Duck on Ciabatta -- I didn't try this, but two of my dinning companions had this twice each and loved it.  I'm not a fan of duck (I find it too greasy), so I didn't try this myself.\n\nOn the bright side, Christy's offers a variety of options other than fries -- tater tots, spicy sweet potato fries, and sweet sweet potato fries.  And they have a number of vegetarian options.  Otherwise, uh, yeah, not much to talk about here other than high prices and a funky atmosphere.\n\nOne not on the decor.  Maybe it's cuz I'm not from this part of the country, but I found the restroom signs mildly racist -- \"Euro Guys\" and \"Euro Girls\" is a little too close to \"no colored people\" for me.  8-(", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-18T09:19:53-0500", "location_id": "2563167", "id": "348928610", "user": {"username": "BearPupSj", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "A Gem", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49181-d2563167-r346569145-m11068-Christy_s_Euro_Pub-Greenville_North_Carolina.html#review346569145", "text": "I had never been here before but loved it.

Stop in and have a bite to eat or grab a cold drink. The menu is quite eclectic and I've never had a bad meal. I've eaten here for lunch several times with coworkers and each time we've left full and 100% pleased with our meals and service. They have a fantastic looking brunch menu as well and one day I will try one of those dishes.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-13T17:16:42-0500", "location_id": "2563167", "id": "339806036", "user": {"username": "AE2012", "user_location": {"name": "Greenville, North Carolina", "id": "49181"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Great Local, Hidden Treasure", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49181-d2563167-r325513521-m11068-Christy_s_Euro_Pub-Greenville_North_Carolina.html#review325513521", "text": "This was my second time eating at Christy's Euro Pub in 12 years and I am kicking myself as to why it has been so long.

Unfortunately Greenville & ECU just don't have that...not like you would expect from a Michigan or Chapel Hill. So it was nice to see that there is an eclectic, seasoned food establishment in Greenville that caters to the college student or the fast passed business professional.
