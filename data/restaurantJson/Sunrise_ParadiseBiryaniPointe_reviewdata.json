We found our seats in a well-lighted, open spaced environment and looked at the menu. There was a very wide selection. From drinks to appetizers to your main dishes and also desserts. I ordered the Mango Lassi which was a very delicious mango shake. The main dishes we ordered were the Chicken Tikki Masala which was so delicious that I did not want to move on to my other dish, which was the Goat Curry. Well, that was amazing too. One thing I forgot to ask was if there was going to be bones in it because there was. It was still tasty though. Along with your meats, you get Basmati Rice and you can also order different types of Nan. I got the Buttered Nan. They gave you so much food that it was enough for two dinners. You definitely get more for your money. The service was not bad either. It is not fine dining. So do not expect to them to be kissing you butt.
