In the meantime the employee never acknowledged that we \nwere still waiting for the Pumpkin Pie. After flagging her down and inquiring \nabout the Pumpkin Pie, her response was \"I know you're waiting for the Pumpkin \nPie to be ready.\" After a few minutes the Pumpkin Pie was delivered and while I \ndrove off onto the expressway and tried the Pumpkin Pie it was dead cold. The \nwait was extremely for 3 small items and customer service was very poor in that \nshe was very unconcerned and never apologetic. I never plan to return to this \nlocation.\n\nI received an email from McDonald's a few days later saying:\n\"I want to thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience at the McDonald's in Bolingbrook, IL with me. Your feedback is very important to us as it allows us to better understand how we can improve our service to you.\nI am sorry your order did not live up to our high quality standards and for the slow service you received. Please be assured that we want to provide you with an exceptional experience every time you visit us. From your email, it is clear we did not meet your expectations. Again, I am truly sorry we disappointed you.\nI want you to know that I have already taken action on your feedback. After reading your email, I immediately shared the information you brought to our attention with the local franchise owner of the restaurant you visited. Additionally, customer feedback is reviewed with our regional McDonald's consultants as part of our ongoing commitment to improving our restaurants' operations.\"\n\nIt's very sad to see no reimbursement for my money!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-09-23T09:37:23-0400", "location_id": "4195603", "id": "230542418", "user": {"username": "AviatorMat", "user_location": {"name": "Darien, Illinois", "id": "35876"}}}]}
