Really, they advertise being able to take out ingredients which are not vegetarian but any other place has this ability too.

They tried twice to convince me to get a meal that I didn't want even after I told them what I wanted to order. The woman talked with me whilst the food was being prepared which was understandable but she would not allow me to leave even 10 minutes after I received my food. I was hoping for a quick grab and go experience. She was very invasive and talked to you as if you were her long time friend which I found inappropriate.

My two sons, future daughter-in-law and I explored some of the antique shops on Main Street, and were looking to get a warm drink at the end of the day.\n\nWe were warmly greeted when we entered, seated and given a menu.  The cuisine is Indian-Mediterranean, and the menu items were described for us.  I started off with a cup of hot tea, and it was great!  It was fresh brewed (not from a tea bag) and nicely spiced with cardomom and some other nice warming spices.  It was so good I had a second cup, and after tasting mine, one of my kids ordered a cup.  We went ahead and ordered some gyro wraps, and they were great.  For desert, we tried the baklava.  It was great, with a hint of cocoa!  After the meal we were brought a mango pudding to sample.  Again, it was delicious, and unlike anything we have had before.\n\nIt turns out that the couple that we were interacting with were the owners!  They are very friendly, and we will definitely be going back when we are in Lynchburg!  They do a lunch buffet that I really want to try.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-01-15T20:57:44-0500", "location_id": "1400505", "id": "340360623", "user": {"username": "Glenn B", "user_location": {"name": "Preston, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Wonderful rest stop!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57919-d1400505-r338716638-m11068-Hot_and_Cold_Cafe-Lynchburg_Virginia.html#review338716638", "text": "The owner is extremely personable and the baba ganoush is fantastic (very garlicky!).
