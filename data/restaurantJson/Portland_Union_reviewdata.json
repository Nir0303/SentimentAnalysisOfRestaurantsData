Literally four of the five courses, with the fifth being dessert, had mushrooms as their primary ingredient (three of those four mushroom courses had oyster mushrooms).\n\nI love mushrooms. I really do.  But I don't want to eat mushrooms for every meal of my prix fixe meal.  After dish two my wife and I were joking to ourselves and asking each other if the third course would contain mushrooms- and surprise, it did.  By the time the fourth course came, the comedic effect wore off.  \n\nWhen you pay $250+ for two people for a tasting menu, at least try to be creative.  I've never seen a restaurant so brazenly offer literally the same main ingredient in every savory prix fixe dish.  If this restaurant were inexpensive, I suppose I wouldn't care too much, but this place wasn't cheap at all.  \n\nWith that said, the ambience and service were great.  Our waitress was efficient and friendly.  And the wine pairing with our fairly terrible five-course tasting was actually good in that the pours were hearty.  All the more reason why it's a shame the food was such a major letdown.
