We were looking for a good cigar shop or lounge, but it was a Sunday, and they were closed.  It is located on the first floor of the Charlotte Marriott, along with other restaurants, and stores...  When entering the restaurant to inquire about the Cigar Bar/Lounge - they called a manager right away to OPEN the lounge for us!!  Of course it was only to buy the cigars, ( no drinks, etc.) but we were really impressed that they have this service available, even when the lounge is closed!\n\nThe cigars were smooth and smoked well - hubby really enjoyed them.  \n\nWould love to visit when open and hang out, with a good cigar, and a good cordial.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-06-03T09:14:18-0400", "location_id": "2898724", "id": "162863784", "user": {"username": "JR671", "user_location": {"name": "NW Indiana", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2013-03", "title": "Decent Selection of Cigars", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49022-d2898724-r156232022-m11068-Cutter_s_Cigar_Bar-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html#review156232022", "text": "This place had  a decent selection of cigars but little else when compared to other cigar shops.\nDid the buy 5 get one free deal and so far 2 out of 3 cigars were not properly humidified and were difficult to smoke.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-04-01T03:52:35-0400", "location_id": "2898724", "id": "156232022", "user": {"username": "Jeff2327", "user_location": {"name": "Indiana, Pennsylvania", "id": "52878"}}}]}
