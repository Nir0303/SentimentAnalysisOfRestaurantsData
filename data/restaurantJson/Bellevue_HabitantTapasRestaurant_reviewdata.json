The service is prompt and Nordstrom courteous.  Although not extensive, the bar menu is adequate for its intended purpose, small plates to share, which can easily be turned into lunch or light dinner.  The Cilantro Lime Tacos are delicious, as are the Smoked Sea Salt Frites, and The Farmstead Cheese Plate.  Although it looks impressive and there are some unique spirits and liqueurs, they don't stock something common, for example, Chambord for mixing a French Martini.  When I ordered one, rather than inform me they did not stock all the ingredients, they improvised and  conjured one up.  It was a less than successful attempt, which they promptly replaced with another choice.  While I applaud the creativity, a heads up would have spared the surprise and disappointment.  A good venue to land rather squarely between the Cafe and the Grill.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-16T15:40:28-0400", "location_id": "8627285", "id": "311135603", "user": {"username": "Janike1", "user_location": {"name": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "id": "31350"}}}]}
