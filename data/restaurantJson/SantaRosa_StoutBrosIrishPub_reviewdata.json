At least not for educated adults with a non american approach of a \"the sylvester night shouldn't be over at 1\" back ground.\nStout Bros looked like the better alternative of the three there were. We paid the entrance VIP fee - for nothing - for nothing as it later turned out. kids falling flat on their faces, behaving like the generation \"young red neck next\", loud and semi aggressive. But worse the staff, security all \" no, you cannot stay here, we are closing this, dancing is not allowed here, .....go somewhere, why?, because I say so....the precise feeling for representatives of the land of the free. And the bar staff more into themselves than in anything else .\nOut of proportion, greedy for entrance and selling to the naive booze buyer. Keep it closed next New Year's Eve, more people would have fun instead of going through this\nThis evening is certainly special but I am afraid during normal biz the attitude is not different", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-07T13:02:36-0500", "location_id": "6199161", "id": "248153186", "user": {"username": "uhelnik", "user_location": {"name": "London, United Kingdom", "id": "186338"}}}]}
