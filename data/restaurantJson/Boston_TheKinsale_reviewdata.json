I grabbed a pint at the bar and although the service was a bit slow, the beer and atmosphere where good.  I tried a Bog iron stinger which apparently is only available in a few bars. For $7.50, it wasn't a bad deal and if I lived or worked in the area, I could see this being a regular haunt of mine. It was pretty empty while I was there, but perhaps it picks up after 6.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-06T17:32:33-0500", "location_id": "482401", "id": "324966323", "user": {"username": "TryppAdams", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Great Irish bar in Beacon Hill", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d482401-r323175790-m11068-The_Kinsale-Boston_Massachusetts.html#review323175790", "text": "I actually ended up going to Kinsale three times during a first visit to Boston.  The restaurant was close to where I was staying;  had a good selection of Irish entrees and Irish whiskeys; and I liked the atmosphere and the TV's.  Lately I have been in the mood to explore traditional Irish cuisine and Boston had a lot of Irish restaurants and pubs.  So I sampled several Irish whiskeys at The Kinsale and also tried several traditional Irish entrees.  Specifically Shepherd's Pie, Fish and Chips and Chicken Pot Pie.  They were all hearty and good.   And it was fun sampling various Irish Whiskeys.   I lucked out with my servers who were familiar with both the entrees and Irish Whiskeys.\n\nIt is a big restaurant with a large bar area with some restaurant seating and TV's, and another larger restaurant area without the TV's.   Overall I enjoyed my meals and the service and the fun of trying some new drinks and meals.  It's simply a good place for a good hearty meal.\n\nRecommended", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-10-30T06:53:12-0400", "location_id": "482401", "id": "323175790", "user": {"username": "Silicon_Valley_Guy1", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Great food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d482401-r323171445-m11068-The_Kinsale-Boston_Massachusetts.html#review323171445", "text": "Recommend the fish and chips.
