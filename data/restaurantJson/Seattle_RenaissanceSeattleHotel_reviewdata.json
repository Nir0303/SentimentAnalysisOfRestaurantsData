Okay, but you want to know about the hotel.  It's good. It's clean, cheerful, polished. Offers a salon, fitness center, etc. It is what you expect from a good conference hotel.  Well organized. The room was comfortable and had a decent amount of plugs available for us multi-device peeps.  Handy fridge in the room.

A one or two night stay on the west side would not be bad but for five nights, to assign a guest to one of those rooms is unconscionable. One member of the hotel staff behaved as though her only objective was to get hotel guests out of her sight.  She was not at all friendly.  All other employees, however, were very friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant on the second floor offers a very nice breakfast but prices seemed a bit high.
