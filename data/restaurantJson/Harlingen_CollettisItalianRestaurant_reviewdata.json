The restaurant decor is romantic and really beautiful. We parked at the side of this huge building downtown. It's obviously a well-kept building. The entrance, on 1st. Street, could be in any European local with it's beautiful cast-iron railings, flaming streetlamps, heavy linen canopies, and twinkling fairy lights. Gorgeous facade! We were greeted warmly by a young waitress and seated. The service was friendly and top-class. I ordered the minestrone soup and spagghetti bolognese. The soup was delicious. The vegetables were plentiful, fresh, and not soggy (overcooked). I'd ordered a cup, but found it to be very filling. My pasta sauce looked darker than traditional bolognese, but it was done to perfection! I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. It's a wonderful experience. And perfect for a romantic dinner. \n\nA big plus for me was the fact that we could have a conversation without straining to hear each other. \nWe all enjoyed watching the young pizza-chef tossing the pizza dough.
