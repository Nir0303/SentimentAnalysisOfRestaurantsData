The option of being able to have a cash deposit was also very nice as I do not use credit cards (I know, I'm the minority here). The rate was nice and later, when I had a family member book me additional nights via the Internet, the rate was even cheaper! And what did I get for this  attractive rate? Not only a very nice Queen bed but a La Z Boy recliner, mini-fridge, microwave, blow dryer and a very spacious balcony. The room was very clean and the housekeeping very good every morning. The pool outside was not the biggest but still very nice and clean with a few patio tables shaded by umbrellas. The breakfast was nothing to write home about but no complaints. Cereal, fruit, muffins, danish and a selection of juices. My only (minor) complaint was that the Wi-Fi could be a little spotty. The staff, though, moved me to a different room with a better connection right away and that solved the problem.\nIn conclusion, the place was great and the staff was super friendly and courteous and helpful.

The shower door fell off when my husband touched it and the shower floor had black grime. The towels were stained and we didn't have hot water. All night we heard fighting and yelling. Worst thing, we saw cockroaches running across the floor. We are so sad because we loved the old staff and the clean rooms.
