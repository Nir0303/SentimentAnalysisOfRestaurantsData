It is a historical park as well as a local park with picnic tables, barbecue areas; children\u2019s play area.  The historic adobe building was built by Jose Higuera.\n\nJose Higuera was the last Spanish governor of California.  In 1828, Higuera built the adobe house which is seen at the park.  The labor for the house was provided by the Ohlone Indians. A prickly pear cactus was planted to serve as a hedge; the cactus is still in the park today.\n\nThe historic adobe building is used for events.   We have enjoyed picnics and barbecues here.  There is also a children\u2019s playground here. The park is also a convenient stopping place if you are biking the hill route streets.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-07-02T16:30:58-0400", "location_id": "6873730", "id": "213376108", "user": {"username": "mini", "user_location": {"name": "Fremont, California", "id": "32411"}}}]}
