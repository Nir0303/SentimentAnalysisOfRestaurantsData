I got the Turkey, Swiss & Tomatoes crepe with pesto. It was filling, but there wasn't much cheese or tomatoes, and the turkey was a little bit cold.

It's only been open a few weeks. \n\nIt didn't take much to convince me as I love crepes and I can never get my husband to enjoy them with me so I was very excited to try it out. \n\nThe Crepe Club, located next to Williams Sonoma, did not disappoint.  \n\nThe atmosphere is sooo pleasant.  The d\u00e9cor is sort of old French, I guess.  Marble everywhere, very clean and bright.  Kind of like a small French bistro.  You order you items at the front desk but the wait staff delivers your food.  You fill your own beverages.  No alcohol is served. \n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and the crepes are delicious.  I had the turkey and swiss with b\u00e9chamel sauce and it was heavenly.  And our side salad was fresh, light and tasty.  They serve sandwiches and Panini's too and I am sure they are equally delicious.  We had chocolate and coconut pastries and they were fabulous!  For an of you who enjoy this type of restaurant, you will be very pleased.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-23T17:10:50-0400", "location_id": "10782866", "id": "409764004", "user": {"username": "Lamborgini3", "user_location": {"name": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "id": "31350"}}}]}
