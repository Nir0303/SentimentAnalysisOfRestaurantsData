Otherwise, we would have chosen another place. Turns out that we should have:  First off, upon arrival and walking in the door, we were told that it was hot in there because the air conditioning was broken. Wonderful. We decided to have a drink and see how tolerable it was. For us, it was fine, so we stayed and had a meal, though other guests were obviously hot. Why they stayed was beyond us, because if it was too hot for us, we were all set to get up and leave.\nThe meal was disappointing. It was both overpriced and barely anything to eat on the plate. $17.99 for five ribs and three chicken tenders with fries is way too much. It was supposed to be half a rack of baby back ribs, but wasn\u2019t. The specialty Ruby drink was delicious, but hardly made up for this overpriced meal. We paid $62.00. It turned out that our coupon expired the day before. Our error. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go back unless I should get another coupon. It just isn\u2019t worth it. The food is nothing extra ordinary and service is adequate. The wait staff did an adequate job in attendance despite the A/C not working all day and was tipped accordingly. I was concerned about someone getting dehydrated and told them to stay hydrated. In reality, on a ninety degree day in Mississippi, this Ruby Tuesday should have been shut down over the weekend until they received the part on Monday, but of course the restaurant wouldn\u2019t want to lose money. Considering the ac was broken, I couldn\u2019t figure out why it was so busy.  All in all, I can\u2019t recommend this restaurant, unless the AC is working and you have a coupon to save some money.
