We arrived around 11:30 and the seating was starting to fill up.  The line to order, which is single file to  a choke point to place your order.  After you place your order you site down and your number is called.  The pizza options are varied and diverse.  The Boss is noted for personal size pizza for around $8 you can have a quick lunch.  It took about 15 to 17 minutes to receive our pizza.  Since we where a ground of 12 we got our food at different times.  As the noon hour approached the seating area filled up fast and many had to eat outside in the overflow are or take it to go.  \n\nThe flavor of the pizza was good and presented on  a metal pan with paper liner.  The crust is thing and crispy with good flavor.  My wife and I shared a Canadian bacon and pineapple.  It was tasty.  I had  a salad that was fantastic.  It was with fresh greens, nuts, accent vegetables and fruit.  The fruit was not as fresh as I would have hoped but very eatable.  The salad was a hit, the pizza was good to very good.  I would go again.  Do not be disappointed if you have to wait for seating.  They are busy and well patronized.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-19T19:20:54-0400", "location_id": "7096445", "id": "229863602", "user": {"username": "ChrisKauaiBette", "user_location": {"name": "Kapaa, Hawaii", "id": "60616"}}}]}
