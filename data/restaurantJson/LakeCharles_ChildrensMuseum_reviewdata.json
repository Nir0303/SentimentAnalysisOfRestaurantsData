They spent the most time on the first floor where there was a grocery and cafe area. They pretended to make groceries and cook things up at the cafe. There was a water table where the kids played with boats and learned about water power. There was a \"bayou\" area where the kids rowed a boat and saw themselves rowing through the bayou on a larger screen as well as a shrimp boat area where they could pretend to be fishermen, complete with rubber boots and a net. There was a rope swing, a rock wall, and a fireman's area. \n\nWe had to drag the kids to the second floor where things got even more interesting. There was a train set, a bubble room, and KARAOKE! It was so fun--even I had a great time. They spent another hour plus on that floor. The third floor included a book nook and a shadow room. \n\nThe staff was kind, professional, and patient. It is located in an older building but everything was clean and the staff was on top of keeping everything sanitized and in tip top shape.

I wouldn't let my 2-year-old play on half of them for fear of getting hurt.  There are \"exhibits\" where the kids swing on ropes.  She wandered right in and almost got clobbered.  There is another exhibit where you pull yourself up by a rope, but there is a \"pinching hazard\" with a big warning sign.  What happens if the kid can't read?  I ended up pulling her off of that \"exhibit\" for safety reasons.  The rest of the \"exhibits\" were mediocre.  She liked the water feature.  The shopping store was pretty standard for children's museums.\n\n3) The toddler/infant area was a padded room with 2...yes 2...toys.
