In fact, every winery we went to had at least one to try.  Not knowing too much about wine ourselves it was interesting to hear the different processes used to make the pinot noir grape taste so differently.

Neither my husband nor I know a lot about wine, we came with 1,000 questions, and never once did we feel uncomfortable asking them\n3) The price was reasonable, and came with all of the tasting fees covered and a mini-lunch of meats and cheeses (from a local company) to eat at a winery of our choice.
