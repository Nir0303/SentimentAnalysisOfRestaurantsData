I waited a little too long considering there was only one person in front of me. The cheese curds were hot which is probably what the wait was about, but my fries were cold. If your going to make me wait for fresh curds than why not give me fresh fries too? I've been here several other times and I guess it's pretty decent and my food is usually hot so I will be returning. I wish they had shrimp available for people that don't eat meat.
