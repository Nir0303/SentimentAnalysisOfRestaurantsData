I knew I'd bring home bags of goodies! The owner explained the family history of the shop and showed us the old photos on the wall. She described the roasting process and the aroma.  People line up to buy these treats before concerts across the street in Lock 3 or before holidays or call to have the foods shipped. We saw the famous Planters Peanut costume from 1939 that is still worn in town parades! We tasted samples, bought plenty, and felt we had made friends.
