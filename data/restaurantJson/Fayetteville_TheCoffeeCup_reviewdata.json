We chose to sit in what I will refer to as the 'living room' on the sofa while we sipped our drinks.  There was only one barista taking, and then making the orders.  She had a system down so no one had an exceptionally long wait.  She was super pleasant.  This is a laid back kind of place where you might take a book to read while you sip your beverage of choice.  The had an iced blueberry coffee available the day we were there, and my companion truly enjoyed it.  I had an iced chai latte (a questionable order in a coffee shop), and it was the best iced chai latte I've ever had.  I drink a lot of them so this is no small statement.

I have been there around 8 times so far. Everytime I have been there, when I come through the door, I am always greeted from where ever the workers are in the building. The sitting area is to the front, always clean, and well arranged, lighting is good. The menu board is easily found and readable. I am greeted again at the counter, no order rushing no matter how busy. The pastries and snacks I have ordered are always fresh and delicious. My coffees/teas are always prepared without rush and thoroughly. They have always tasted very good, no spilling on the outside of the cup...the cups and lids, sugars, and other things are easily in reach. I like the idea of using the Ipad to do business in taking orders. And as I said before, the workers are always friendly and personable to have a conversation and inquire of your health. I am very satisfied with going there. And the fact it is by other places I may need to go as well as the movie theatre is a plus.
