For those unfamiliar, it is a local take-n-bake, but you can pay a little extra to have them bake the pizza. The crust is out of this world! My favorite is the brat pizza. Not only are the ingredients fresh, but the owner is extremely friendly. I love that you can have fresh 'frozen' pizzas. We will definitely be regular customers!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-04T15:10:24-0400", "location_id": "11305973", "id": "434674118", "user": {"username": "Jen U", "user_location": {"name": "Waukesha, Wisconsin", "id": "60365"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Flaky, Buttery Crust and Fresh Flavors make this Wonderful", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60365-d11305973-r421878913-m11068-Milwaukee_Crust_Pizza_Co-Waukesha_Wisconsin.html#review421878913", "text": "My first trip to the new pizza place downtown Waukesha went very well.  The inside of the restaurant features many chalk boards that my two little people loved to draw on.  The pizza arrived hot and tasted very good.  They talk about their crust being \"Milwaukee Style\" and I agree it is different in a good way.  Some pizza crusts just taste and feel like bread, but this is buttery and flaky.
