The biggest challenge for Morey's place is finding an identity or at least a nitch.  Experimentation has gone on (ranging from a South Seas cuisine to Mediterranean influenced servings).  Comfort hold overs like Nana Jean's pot roast and pot roast sandwiches remain popular.  Unfortunately the lake of theme or identity, makes it difficult to recommend this restaurant as a solid \"4\"; while the quality of the food may well deserve that rating.  The cost of dining at Morey's is definitely higher than Moderate, so that too influences where you might dine.  At the same price point, their are so many options within a mile radius of Morey's Place.  We keep coming back in periodically hoping that the restaurant has found it's way, as we want to see a successful restaurant in this Old Town Tustin location.
