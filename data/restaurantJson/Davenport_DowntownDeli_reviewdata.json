Their closing time is 3:00, but the two staff workers were very friendly and allowed us to go ahead and order and eat in. In fact, as we were eating, we counted at least 10-12 people come in and order after us-- I am thinking maybe they should just extend their hours through dinner. Ordered a sandwich (can't recall what it is called) served on a pretzel bun. The sandwich was simply awesome! Not sure why anyone would go to a chain after eating here. I got chicken tortilla soup for a side that was also very good. This is a great downtown spot with excellent food and excellent service. I wish I lived closer to this deli to be a regular, but I will definitely hit it when I am in town. Side note: they have a nice collection of vintage lunch boxes displayed on the wall.
