I cleaned these stains with a hotel towel and took them to the front desk to complain and they offered to clean the room to which I replied \" I just cleaned it for you and my wife is going to be in bed all day with a migraine.\" The next morning at checkout I found the stain by the bathroom door which I cleaned and took to the front desk. I was upset that I had to do this in a room I was paying for and asked for a refund of at least one night to which the young lady replied she could do nothing for me because there was no manager. I called later that day to speak to a manger and was told that he was going to be out until Wednesday in meetings but that they would mention it to him and see what he says. Well a couple of hours later I get a call from the girl at the front desk saying the manager said no to my request and that if I wanted to I could call Wednesday and take it up with him.  My thought is that if this GM cared about his hotel, job, customer satisfaction, etc. He would have been the one to reach out to me instead of sending the girl to do his job. That being said, next time I will spend the extra money and go to a real hotel where they care about the customer and if I ever have this problem again I will take pictures and lt them clean their mess for themselves.

I ask to have the copy back in the morning when I check out and she refuses.  She cannot tell my why this hotel needs to have a copy of the license other than it is the \"policy\".  The copy is stored in a non-secured location right on counter.  There is no documentation or notice that a copy of my drivers license is required to rent the room.  Call Wyndham customer service in the morning and they say they cannot contact the front desk to ask her to return copy.  I called police non-emergency number and a very nice deputy from the Centennial Police department helped me get the copy returned.  Of course, the front desk clerk was on the phone with the supervisor of the customer service agent I spoke to earlier.  So, apparently they CAN contact the front desk but only when it is to their benefit.  The lobby was run down and dingy.  There was a guest in the lobby on the phone with a bail bondsman in the computer/business center area.  The room smelled of smoke even though it was marked as non-smoking.
