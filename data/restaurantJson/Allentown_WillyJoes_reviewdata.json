I was on my way to the Wawa on 15th St. when the open sign at Willie Joe's caught the corner of my eye. I circled the block, parked in front and went down into Willie Joe's. \n\nI wasn't looking for a full meal, so I ordered one dog with everything. If you're from around here, you know that that means mustard, chopped onions and chili sauce. The total cost with tax was $1.51. The dog was perfect. \n\nThis is the original location of Willie Joe's. It's below street level, so you have to walk down five or six steps to get in. It isn't handicapped accessible. There is no where to sit. This is just a counter where you order food to go. I just ate in the customer area because there wasn't anyone else there. \n\nIf you're not in the mood for the hotdog, and you can't decide between a hamburger or a steak sandwich, consider the \"Steak On Burger\". It's a hamburger with steak sandwich meat on top.
