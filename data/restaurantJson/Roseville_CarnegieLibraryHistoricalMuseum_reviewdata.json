It is partially Carnegie-endowed, thus the name reference. It is replete with old things, railroad models to depict the large presence of the Southern Pacific main maintenance yard with two swivel tracks to efficiently maintain the large number of locomotives and railroad cars that called Roseville their home. \n\nBesides the normal pictures of different eras, it also has an excellent photography and introductory references to some of the mining and agricultural pursuits of locals in the area. \n\nIt's very informative and is part of The Heritage Trail program the region has to make it easierfor people to learn about many of the museums, land grants and commercial activity that has occurred in the area.
