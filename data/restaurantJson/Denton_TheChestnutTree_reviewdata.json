The place is right on the square and while crowded at lunch was warm and inviting. I loved the diverse menu which included lunch and breakfast options. The tomato basil soup was delicious and hit the spot on a cold day. I also had the spinach quiche which was tasty. I would definitely come here again!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-01-23T06:28:49-0500", "location_id": "510214", "id": "342127381", "user": {"username": "Drtamaragrosz", "user_location": {"name": "Aubrey, Texas", "id": "30195"}}}]}
