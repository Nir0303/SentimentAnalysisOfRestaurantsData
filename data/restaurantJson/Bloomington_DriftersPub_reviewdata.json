It features a large open space with exposed-HVAC industrial d\u00e9cor befitting the showpiece of the establishment, the long concrete bar.\n\nWhile the size and starkness of the place might lend a feeling of sterility or lack of intimacy, it resists being too college-y or too yuppie or too stuffy, and serves as a modern and comfortable place to meet friends for drinks with occasional trivia offerings and the like - a reliable bar experience stemming from thoughtful investment of resources, with well-trained friendly staff and convenient location. Not a bad place to meet up and start your night, perhaps with an order from next-door Garcia's pizza being passed through the adjacent dumbwaiter.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-01T11:48:33-0500", "location_id": "4988587", "id": "344353198", "user": {"username": "Jake F", "user_location": {"name": "Bloomington-Normal, Illinois", "id": "3511564"}}}]}
