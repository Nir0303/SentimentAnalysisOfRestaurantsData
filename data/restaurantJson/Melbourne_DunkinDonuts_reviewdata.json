I printed the coupon off of my computer. \n\nI submitted the coupon to the female employee at the drive-thru. She couldn't scan it through the register. She told me that I had to re-print it larger so the code showed up better...... Really?  The actual coupon I gave her was already half the size of a normal piece of paper: 5 1/2 by 11.....okay.........she had already handed me the large prepared drink with lots of whipped cream on the top. It cost $3.79 plus tax.\n\nThe female handed over my coupon to another employee. This time a male. He also tried to scan it into the register - NO luck.\n\nI stupidly offered to pay for the FREE large Birthday drink?  Why in the world did I do that? NO answer.  Three guesses what happened?  They accepted my money.\nYes, I actually paid for the drink.......why didn't I give it back to them & leave?\n         \nWhile driving home from Dunkin Donuts I began getting angry - saying to myself:\nWhat just happened?  Why did I foolishly pay for the FREE DRINK? It wasn't my fault they couldn't perform their job properly.  I gave them a legitimate coupon. My driver's license was available if they wanted to see it - although they shouldn't ask for that either.\n\nI pulled my SUV over & called the same Donkin Donuts restaurant on the phone.\nThe phone # was on the receipt. The same female drive-thru employee answered. \nI politely told her that she should NOT have made me pay for the FREE Birthday drink. That it wasn't the right thing to do.....oh, yeah, she said she'd take off 10% so the damage wouldn't seem to bad......guess what?  I am already a senior citizen.\nI should have gotten that 10% anyway.  OMG!!!  This means Dunkin Donuts gave me NOTHING but aggravation.  (well, I'll be fair & state that the large Collette drink with whipped cream is delicious!)\n \nI asked the female store employee for the Donkin Donut's Headquarters phone #.\nShe said she didn't have it....yeah, right!.  She then said, \"YOU CAN GOOGLE IT\".   \n(Why don't YOU google it yourself, young lady?)   Soooo, I get ripped off, am forced to investigate where to file a complaint & demand money back....nice birthday.\n\n pulled my car over, searched the web for Dunkin Donuts Headquarters. Thank God someone answered. I filed a complaint. The female employee apologized, looked up my e-mail & sent me another FREE coupon for any size drink on my computer.\nPhew!!!   Thank you. It was the right thing to do.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-07-25T15:38:38-0400", "location_id": "5047214", "id": "396987868", "user": {"username": "Lynn M", "user_location": {"name": "Barefoot Bay, Florida", "id": "34071"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "What can one say...great donuts", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34433-d5047214-r366115729-m11068-Dunkin_Donuts-Melbourne_Brevard_County_Florida.html#review366115729", "text": "Visited with four friends for coffee and donuts.
