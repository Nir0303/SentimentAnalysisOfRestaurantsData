We were the only ones dining in, but there was a steady stream of take-out orders being picked up. The staff was very courteous and our order of a 14 inch pizza was made within 20 minutes. The restaurant itself seems like it is still under a bit of construction as there is a bar on the other side of the dining area which looked undone. There is a beautiful mural on the wall with contemporary light fixtures; quite eclectic. Our pizza was DELICIOUS and reminiscent of what pizza used to taste like when I was a child. You can tell that everything was homemade. You could taste the yeast in the dough, which was light and crispy. The sauce tasted like it had been simmering on the stove. The cheese was very authentic; aged to perfection, buttery, and chewy. The best pizza I have tasted by far in Youngstown and I have lived here my entire life! There are other things on the menu such as soups, salads, and desserts. Prices are comparable to other local establishments. Another best kept secret of Downtown Youngstown. I would definitely dine here again.
