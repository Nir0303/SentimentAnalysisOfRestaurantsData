We ordered the mixed grill, plantains, and the paella.  Of the three, the mixed grill was probably the best. The fried plantains lacked any flavor even with the salsa and the paella wasn't very authentic.

Nice simple decor, lots of room between tables.  the menu was good, service was friendly.  we ate a lot of good food.
