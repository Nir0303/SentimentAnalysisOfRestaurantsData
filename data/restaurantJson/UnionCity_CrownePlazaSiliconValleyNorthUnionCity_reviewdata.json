Luckily, I only had to stay one night, but the one night I did spend there was not what I would call a relaxing, quiet hotel.\n\nFrom what I've been told, the hotel is undergoing renovation and if you get a room in their new tower, those are nice and new. But I wasn't so lucky. I stayed in a room by their pool on the second floor. \n\nThe hotel grounds were well maintained and the hotel itself is a nice looking place. The staff was very courteous and efficient. I arrived just before a large tour bus pulled up and had to check in about 40 people. The staff did a good job of having one associate helping the tour bus and the other associate working on checking in the other guests and kept the line moving. \n\nMy room was musty smelling. It just smelled old, probably why they are doing renovations. They had a nice looking bar/restaurant area but I didn't use that. The room features and lights all worked properly and there were no stains or major defects in fixtures. \n\nI did have to wake up early in the morning for work and unfortunately, there were very noisy guests not only on my floor, but in the room above me. Kids that were running around the halls yelling until well past 11pm. The building was not designed to dampen the sound of footsteps well and I found getting a good night sleep was not going to happen. The pillows were so big my head was kicked at a 45 degree angle and was not very comfortable. \n\nMy options for hotel accommodations were not up to me, and were made by my company. For one night, I could handle the noise, but if I had to stay there for an extended period of time I would have requested a room in the new tower. \n\nI don't know what other hotels there are in the surrounding area, but I would imagine this isn't the best or the worst.
