Next I had the ham, potato, peppers, onion and fantastic seasonings combined as a hash. My better half had the goat cheese, mushroom and bacon omelette with fresh fruit, both meals were exceptional. Our server Jon Michael was attentive, and there when you needed with just a glance in his direction. \n\nWell done Flipside, I only give a 5 if exceptional in every facet, this is certainly well deserved in my opinion and well worth your time to visit and enjoy.
