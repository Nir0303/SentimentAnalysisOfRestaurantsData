It came with the most delicious Minestrone Soup and homemade bread.\n\nThe second time we had Veal Marsala and Ravioli with Bolognese Sauce (the sauce was soooo good the first time, we had to have it again!). The raviolis once again melted in your mouth. And that veal was the best we've ever had. They get their meats specially made and you can tell. This day their soup was Manhattan Clam Chowder that was super. \n\nI don't have the words to say how great the meals were, but we truly felt we were in Italy. And their prices are so reasonable.

We split an arancini (crisp light crust, creamy cheesy center with just the right amount of bolognese) and calamari frite (very nicely prepared). Two of us had house salads (ordinary but the dressing was good) and two lentil soup (rich and delicious).  The manicotti was excellent, penne alla vodka had just the right amount of sauce, and the veal Marsala was tender and delicious.  But the star of our meal was the homemade tagliatelle.  That night it had been made with sundried tomatoes.  One could have it with your choice of sauce. I asked what the chef recommended - the answer, Alfredo.  It was the best pasta dish I've ever had outside of Italy.  The pasta was incredible and cooked to perfection and the Alfredo sauce was creamy and light.  We finished with a cannoli - crisp shell with a sweet creamy filling.  It's family owned and operated - met several of them and they couldn't have been nicer or more appreciative of our enjoyment of their restaurant.  Only criticism was the wine was warm.

I said lets check Trip Advisor and see where the pizza is in your town. Thats how we found Little Sicily Trattoria. Pizza was flavorful, crisp traditional thin crust that you can fold without!!!! breaking.. A true pizza.. Cooked to perfection!! We had a veggie and a sausage and veggie. Both excellent!!! We will be back. Because I want Arancini!!!! And rigatoni bolognese!! Can't wait to have pizza again too.. Cute small place that has wine and beer if you like. Nice small menu.. With a lot of care taken.
