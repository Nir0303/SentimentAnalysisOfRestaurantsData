The restaurant is clean, including the restroom, I have also entered the business from the rear, which I walked through the kitchen, I observed the kitchen to be clean and orderly, and the cooks appeared clean looking. All the meals I have ordered where tasty, I just had to add flavor for my tasting, which was supplied by the restaurant, as far as meats and seafood the restaurant should add more, the veggies over power the meals. I ordered by phone. The meals are ready on time as promised. I will recommend.\nJohnnie Belinda Jackson", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-19T10:42:02-0400", "location_id": "5422512", "id": "420249713", "user": {"username": "Belinda J", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Save your patience for something worth more than dinner- dealing with these people is an absolute nightmare.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g36854-d5422512-r255343739-m11068-Lucky_Food-Waukegan_Lake_County_Illinois.html#review255343739", "text": "Food is good- but service is terrible....my order did not make its way through their \"online ordering\" ordering website correctly, and when I called, they doubted my description and even hung up on me.
