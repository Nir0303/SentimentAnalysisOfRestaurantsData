Although not QUITE a restaurant, (no dinner or menus), it is a perfect happy hour place after work to sip wine, craft beers, nibble cheeses and listen to local musicians. To me, that's a meal. BUT one must know HOW to do this....we had no clue our first time there, as we are fairly new to the area and looked silly at first, standing around. Writing this so YOU will know better! \n1. Go inside and select your bottle of red wine from the racks. Prices are on the back at the bottom, and are arranged low-high, left to right, by style. Domestic is on the back wall, imports near the door. Whites and bottled beers are in the chiller. Pick up the one(s) you want while you shop.\n2. Review the blackboard behind the register for the day's specials and prices. The best choice for 2 is the 3-cheese platter with crackers and dried fruit for $16. They serve A LOT of cheese on this, and we took some home.\n3. Select your 3-5 cheeses from the display case. There also is smoked fish dip, hummus and a few other selections in the tall case by the door, as well as gourmet grocery items throughout the store that pair with wine.\n4. Pay for your things and go outside, select a table. First come, first serve. A server will bring your food and wine with glasses (not plastic) to you and pour. \n5. There is a seafood vendor on site, but I believe it is raw and for take-home purchase. Not sure how that fit into the mix...\nAlthough open all day, I recommend going after 5 as it is cooler and better ambiance. The night we went, ALL TABLES were full! Solo musicians perform on stage, and I noticed no smoking at the tables. The place closes at 8, but the new manager (owner?) stuck around until most of the patrons were finishing up. It was still hopping at 9 the night we were there. It is a bit pricey (our bill for 2 was $55), but if you buy a cheap bottle or beer, you can do this place for much less. Our cheeses, fish dip and Pinot Noir were all VERY good.
