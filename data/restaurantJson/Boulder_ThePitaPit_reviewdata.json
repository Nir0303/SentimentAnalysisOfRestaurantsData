The keys to a great gyro are well seasoned meat, fresh veggies, flavorful Tzatziki sauce and fresh Pita.\n\nPita Pit has very good pita bread and veggies are generally good. They also offer items like jalapeno, hummos, olives, mushrooms and more. \n\nThe disappointment is that the gyro meat is pre-cooked, and reheated on a flattop. The meat is bland, with little seasoning.  I asked for extra tzatziki sauce and it was very disappointing..it lacked the bite of the cucumber and the sourness and acid needed for good sauce.\n\nI can only imagine this restaurant  survives because it is across the street from Boulder HS.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2013-04-12T19:59:08-0400", "location_id": "381453", "id": "157564330", "user": {"username": "LorenzoLorenzo", "user_location": {"name": "Boulder, Colorado", "id": "33324"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "LOOOVE this place.
