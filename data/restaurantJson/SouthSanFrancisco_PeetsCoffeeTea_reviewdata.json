Not very effective if you're in technology working with proprietary information.  There should be at least the option for privacy as it was in the past.  Also, the music wasn't classical it was something else that was distracting.  Peets SSF, get it together.  This could be a wonderful love affair if you play the right soft classical music and fix your dining area back to the way it was.  I also suggest adding some dimension of light into the store as it is way too dark and feels dungeon-ish.  Aside from that, the coffee is great and the snacks are fine.
