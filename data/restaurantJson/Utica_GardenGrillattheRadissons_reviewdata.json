The meat stations were overdone and dried out, the breakfast choices were cold and tasted terrible, and the prices were raised to more than we ever paid making it extremely expensive for a poor quality meal.  The wait staff was excellent, but to top it all off, management could not deliver an accurate bill after 4 tries, repeatedly handing us a bill that was incorrectly overpriced, even over their already expensive prices.  Of course if we hadn't checked it we would have paid an even more outrageous price for an already expensive meal.  After the fourth erroneous bill was received and given back to management, the frustrated manager screamed at us, the customer, with no regard to trying to fix an outrageous situation.  The fifth attempt at a bill was still overpriced by 5 dollars (the original more than 30 dollars so an improvement), but we paid it anyway just to be able to leave......we had been waiting for a bill for more than 25 minutes at that point.  So much for the customer being right, at this restaurant in Utica NY, you're not only wrong but you are the subject of ridicule and badmouthing from their management.
