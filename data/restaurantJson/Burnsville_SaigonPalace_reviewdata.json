She ordered pho and I ordered a rice platter and thought it would be like the pho from Minneapolis or Saint Paul.  Unfortunately it was a weird flavor and my wife did not like it.  We go to a lot of pho places and this one had very little noodles to soup ratio also very little meat.  In the end she didnt finish her pho.  I had the rice platter, and while it tasted good it came with this salty seafood flavor broth.  It was so salty I couldn't have more than a spoonful.  The meat was okay not seasoned enough and rice cooked well but the salad was not very tasty.\n\nService was subpar as we had a young girl that looked like in junior high school and didn't know about customer service.  I asked if I could get another broth that was less salty and she brought me another but it was still very salty and unbearable.  \n\nI will not go back and would rather go to St Paul for pho which is a shame because I live so close.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-22T17:35:28-0400", "location_id": "3974716", "id": "409014671", "user": {"username": "Scott K", "user_location": {"name": "Burnsville, Minnesota", "id": "42915"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "awesome", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42915-d3974716-r262252395-m11068-Saigon_Palace-Burnsville_Minnesota.html#review262252395", "text": "This is the best place in Burnsville.
