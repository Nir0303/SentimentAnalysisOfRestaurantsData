We started off with a bottle of a Greek Red with some appetizers of Grilled Calamari, Zucchini Chips and a Beet salad.  Salad was interesting, as it seemed that I was the only one enjoying it:  Marinated vinaigrette beets, with figs, walnuts and manouri cheese! It was quite good. \n\nTo cut on wait time, as you enter, you order your food and drinks off a wall menu or a menu is  given to you. You pay at the cash register and off you go to find an available table. Not bad, and it works for me, if its not crowded. However, parking is a bit of a problem, on a busy night, it would be rare to find available parking in front of KGK, since there are only about 4-5 parking spaces. Hopefully, the KGK staff are not parking in those spots. But, if you don't mind, a small 1 block walk, you might find some available in the parking area next to several other restaurants who customers are looking to jump in your spot.  \n\nAll in all, we had a good time in this small but comfortable open bar kitchen atmosphere.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-14T11:25:11-0400", "location_id": "2199025", "id": "427961136", "user": {"username": "arturofranz", "user_location": {"name": "La Habra, California", "id": "32576"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Excellent food in a sleek, modern setting", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32416-d2199025-r421288018-m11068-Kentro_Greek_Kitchen-Fullerton_California.html#review421288018", "text": "Kentro Greek Kitchen is located in downtown Fullerton; it shares a parking lot with the Fullerton Transportation Center as well as numerous restaurants and night clubs.  The area can get very busy so allow yourself a few minutes to hunt for a parking space.  You order at the counter and your food is delivered to you at your table.  You usually associate this service style with eateries more focused on speed of service than food quality, but that is not the case here.  The cuisine is excellent.\n\nWe started with the calamari saganaki appetizer; the tender calamari (not the common deep fried variety) is served in a sauce of tomato, garlic and feta, and is accompanied by slices of their delicious rustic bread.  For our entrees, my son and I ordered a couple of classic Greek dishes, souvlaki and moussaka (both of which were excellent), while my wife went with the more unusual (and outstanding) Manouri flat bread that featured Manouri cheese, figs, arugula, oregano, honey and olive oil.  We finished off our meal by sharing a delightful order of Loukoumades (a Greek beignet topped with honey and vanilla ice cream).\n\nThe service is friendly and helpful, and the contemporary d\u00e9cor definitely does not scream \u201cfast food.\u201d  Be forewarned that you will be paying prices that are comparable to those of a full service restaurant.

Flavor just oozes out of every bite of food they make. My wife and I had the lamb chops and they were succulent, tender, and spiced perfectly. I had the Greek salad with my order and it was the best I have ever had!! My wife had fries and they were just fantastic! Crisp and with just a hint of spices. The baklava was also top notch. So, you ask, why only four stars? Well, they have this system of ordering at a counter, paying for your food and then it is delivered to your table. I just find that system not conducive to a fine dining experience. As a first-timer, I did not feel free to ask questions about several menu items with a line of patrons waiting behind me to get their order in. With a personal wait staff, you feel as if you can explore the menu, ask for recommendations and explanations without inconveniencing anyone else in the restaurant. The system also breaks down if you want anything else with your meal (like baklava). Finding someone who will claim you as a patron they will wait on for an after-sale was very difficult. Most of the wait staff just ignored us and we had to get aggressive just to get their attention. But, I'll say it again, the food was worth it!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-09T12:13:31-0500", "location_id": "2199025", "id": "331688461", "user": {"username": "Jim C", "user_location": {"name": "Anaheim, California", "id": "29092"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Distracted and Inattentive service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32416-d2199025-r330616946-m11068-Kentro_Greek_Kitchen-Fullerton_California.html#review330616946", "text": "The servers were distracted.
