We were able to park in the lot which is saying something because typically it is packed. Good bar. Has the usual bar food. I had the nachos which as you can see from the picture was huge. Good service. Waitress staff was friendly although we got passed around to several different servers while we were there. Lots of locals and the place gets pretty loud. Really smokey. Typically smokers are not a concern but for some reason it was really intense this night. Food was good. Prices were reasonable.

We went on a rainy weekday and it was fairly quiet in there.  There were several guys at the bar and only one other booth occupied.  We both had burgers - which were good - but nothing \"real special\".  (I've had better and worse)  My husband got the onion peels and said he wouldn't get them again.  He likes things crunchy - and they didn't look crunchy to me.  We don't smoke, and smoking is allowed there, but it didn't seem to be too bad.  I didn't have to wash my clothes immediately.  I used the bathroom, and the ceiling was leaking and the floor was a little wet from the rain - so definitely a \"bar\" type atmosphere.  I'm sure on the weekends it's packed because of being close to the college and they offer a HUGE pizza that I'm sure 3-4 guys could eat, they had pool tables, etc.  ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-11-19T17:29:53-0500", "location_id": "5455839", "id": "327923870", "user": {"username": "VicB423", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Charles, Missouri", "id": "44876"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Horrible Pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g44876-d5455839-r290758633-m11068-AAA_Burgers_and_More-Saint_Charles_Missouri.html#review290758633", "text": "The burger was good, but the pizza was horrible.
