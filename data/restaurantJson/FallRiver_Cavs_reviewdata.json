She kept checking on us to make sure all was well with our orders. The bartender also came over a couple of times to ask if we were enjoying ourselves, and to see if we had everything we needed.  \nTwo of us ordered the shrimp scampi, one with linguini, the other with pene. The shrimp were a nice size and there were 6 to 8 shrimp, with the sauce tasting light with a wine and lemon flavor. I was happy i ordered the salmon, which had a delicous, light, but not over powering amount of a cream sauce around it. The salmon came with a choice of 2 sides, I chose mashed potatoes, and the vegetable medley.  Our last friend chose the marinated steak tips, cooked medium rare, to his liking, with his 2 sides. We also ordered side salads with our meals, which were a nice size, and fresh.  We chose cheesecake for dessert with a fruit compote design over it which was very tasty.\nThe atmosphere was quiet, relaxing, with a beautiful window view of city hall. We arrived after 7:00pm on an early fall evening, but had it been a summer night, we could have enjoyed a dring and an appetizer on their front patio,which I am sure would have been lovely.\nThe dining room had about 12 tables, covered with white table cloths which gave it a somewhat elegant flair.
