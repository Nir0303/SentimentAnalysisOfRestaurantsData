Decided to stop in and try, this small storefront is a nice spot to drop in for some Greek food. \nOur Server was Edison \"Eddie\" who was charming and honest when I asked him questions.  I highly recommend him.  He made sure our table was always clean and glasses filled. On top of everything, makes a wonderful impression. He passed all my tests with flying colors. They are still working on the menu and I am sure more to come.  \nThe falafel appetizer was very tasty. Our Entrees - The Mediterranean Sea Bass, cooked to perfection with lots of flavor. Highly recommend for fish lovers. The Greek Grill Mix had lamb, chicken and kefte kabob I liked having a variety. The French fries were bursting with flavor and when you dip it into tzatziki, Yummy! \nThe end was a delicious Cheesecake Baklava. A must!!!!\nI will not lie, this is not a traditional full style restaurant, it is storefront, casual, quick eat in or take out. But, more cafe style. \nDefinitely worth a try. \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-17T16:56:08-0400", "location_id": "10274752", "id": "428961630", "user": {"username": "Sara M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Excellent Mediterranean Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34296-d10274752-r427743264-m11068-Greek_Grill-Hollywood_Broward_County_Florida.html#review427743264", "text": "Visited this restaurant today for dinner and I found that the food was excellent, the service was on spot. My husband and I both ordered the lamb gyro and for an appetizer we had the spinach pie. The spinach pie was not your usual pie, it was actually 3 small pieces, so if you are accustomed to what you get in other greek restaurants don't look for it here. The lamb Gyro was excellent, it did not have a heavy taste that remains with you after eating. It was served over rice with a side salad, which was also excellent.

I had the chicken souvlaki skewer with a side of vegetables and salad.  Again, the food was delicious.  Along with two beers, the total bill was $41.00, so a very good price.
