Very nice inside with a warm greeting and friendly staff. \n \nThere are a variety of items on the menu to satisfy varied palettes depending on your appetite.   We went with the hanger steak and the lasagne.  Both were very good and we would get them both again.  The lasagne is a large portion so some will be going home with you.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-09T09:52:11-0400", "location_id": "2551662", "id": "297236900", "user": {"username": "akittynamedtabitha", "user_location": {"name": "Woodinville, Washington", "id": "58835"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-05", "title": "Great time and awesome staff", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58702-d2551662-r292993292-m11068-Redmond_s_Bar_Grill-Redmond_Washington.html#review292993292", "text": "Really like to have team events here and bring friends.

But we were very suprised with the quality and variety of the food and friendliness of the wait staff.  Out of the four of us 3 had the beef dip sandwich and I had the chicken gyro.  The beef was very tender and my chicken was done just right and juicy in the middle. They serve local beers and our friend said the dark beer he had was delicious. The fries are very good crucnhy outside and tender inside.  The price is very modest.  Great place for lunch or dinner.
