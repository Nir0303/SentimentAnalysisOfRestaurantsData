We stayed 2 nights here (The Inn at the Square).  This beautiful, old home has several functions.  As a B&B and as an event venue.  We stayed in the King Suite which was an addition to the main house.  We understand the main house contained three additional rooms upstairs that are also available for reservations.  Our room was nice.  It was a large room with a sitting area.  Tucked in one corner was a mini fridge and a table with a coffee pot.  Coffee, sweetners & creamer were supplied.  There were several bottles of water in the fridge.  Also supplied were wine glasses and a corkscrew.  The owner supplied us with vouchers for breakfast, good at several establishments downtown within walking distance.  The breakfasts were awesome. Loved being able to order what we wanted. The location of the Inn couldn't have been much better.  We love walking downtown enjoying the scenery and shopping. My only complaint was lack of an area in the room to hang clothing.  Hope to visit again in the near future.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-11T13:07:06-0500", "location_id": "3653382", "id": "326081205", "user": {"username": "Darlene W", "user_location": {"name": "Jackson, Mississippi", "id": "43833"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Wedding reception turned nightmare ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55055-d3653382-r321487779-m11068-Lillie_Belle_s-Franklin_Tennessee.html#review321487779", "text": "Absolute wonderful food.

A day trip or quick visit always calls for a special dining experience. Lillie Belle's lovely old Victorian house invites you inside for a cup of tea or lunch! They are open Tuesday through Saturday from 11:00 until 2:00 and unless you have six or more in your party you do not need reservations.  I recently visited with friends from out of town. We had a special day! Lillie Belle's was the perfect way to enjoy our time together.\nThis used to be a tea room, closed and became a venue for weddings and receptions only.  Now it is open as a restaurant. It has all the charm of a tea room-lovely tablecloths and napkins, delicate china and your own personal pot of tea if you like, but business men and tourists will be seen eating there as well. Prices are reasonable. The food is delicious and the servers, friendly and attentive. Just wait until you see the dessert tray! You will definitely want to save room for that. I had the Georgia Pecan cake and it was, as the young folks say, \"awesome\"! Everyone else at our table said the same about theirs.\nLillie Belle's is easy to find. The blue house is hard to miss, just off the town square. Hwy.96 becomes 3rd Ave. and it is on the left just before round-about.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-12-01T23:08:35-0500", "location_id": "3653382", "id": "146598781", "user": {"username": "sullyfamly", "user_location": {"name": "Mount Juliet, Tennessee", "id": "55222"}}}]}
