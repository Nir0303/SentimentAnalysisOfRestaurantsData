While we have enjoyed some good meals in our town I believe we found the Creme de la Creme of food and service here in Fayetteville on our first trip here for a Hogs game.  First off I thank Trip Advisor for allowing individuals to freely post reviews.  I have been posting and gaining knowledge from your resource for many years. It has helped my husband and I enjoy the best when traveling.  This trip is the same.  The reviews of this restaurant were spot on. This fine dining Italian restaurant is casual,  funky and extremely divine in its flair for tasty food. 4 of us had the pleasure of having Tammy serve us.  She was clear about how busy the restaurant was and some changes had been made since some items had been depleted due to the crowds from the game.  The chef had clearly made some wonderful changes and additions even with the crowds!  I started with a Banana Foster martini that Tammy recommended.  No doubt, hands down the best specialty martini I have ever had.  The antipasta plate we shared was wonderful. I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops  and my husband the veal chops, Everything was truly yummy and divine.  Fresh from local or fresh flown in.  This chef has exquisite taste in food selection and combining.  Our friend enjoyed their scallops and filets as well and stated their food was just wonderful.\n\nService here is fast and incredible!   All to Tammy's expertise of the menu and willingness to accommodate the customer, no question was out of her reach.  She knows this menu, restaurant, it's chef and manager well enough to make your time here a true food experience.\n\nThe manager shared some information with me when I told him I write a lot of reviews for Trip Advisor.  He explained they had had a call from someone with Trip Advisor a while back stating they believed someone was writing false reviews to pump up their ratings.  They stated they were going to drop their ratings status because of this.  I can only say that if this happened I am truly sad.  No doubt people taking the time to write a review is time consuming.  To write a truthful review and a valid review to help others is what this is all about.  Let the numbers of visitors be your quite and what the reviews state about the place.  This is surely a restaurant you want to take in while in the area.  It really is #1 in my book in Arkansas!", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-06T02:52:37-0500", "location_id": "2436132", "id": "435019981", "user": {"username": "candi A", "user_location": {"name": "Little Rock, Arkansas", "id": "60766"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "So so", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31589-d2436132-r434923250-m11068-Vetro_1925-Fayetteville_Arkansas.html#review434923250", "text": "The bread was divine.

In the five courses we had lamb, shrimp, pasta, fish, steak and dessert as well and wine with each. It was a lot of food and I was definitely full at the end but felt good.
