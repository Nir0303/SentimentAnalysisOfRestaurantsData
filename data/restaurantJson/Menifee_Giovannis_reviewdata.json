They do not skimp, and it shows. Their home made sausage seems to be a cut above than the competition, and generally we like what they put in their pizzas. We usually go for the thin crust, but as I mentioned before, together with the amount of cheese they use, these pizzas are heavier and will fill most appetites with fewer slices.
