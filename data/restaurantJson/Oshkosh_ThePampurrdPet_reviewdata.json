We have a 2-year-old Shi Tzu named Bunny and a 12 year-old Bloodhound named Tanner. We're both retired gov't employees. \n\nA few weeks ago we took a trip down to the Oshkosh Farmer's Market and noticed this cute little store on the way there. Needless to say that Bunny and Tanner loved the store. They got a treat and my wife bought a bunch of nuance items for our dogs (she's obsessed with their appearance us being \"empty nesters\" and all). \n\nThe young man with the goattee was a excellent sales clerk and a down-to-earth guy. We are definitely going to make another trip down to the store once Bunny and Tan are done with their toys. I told this young man that they need to start a chain of these stores and expand once they get some time in. He's got that business acumen and what it takes.\n\n-Al", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-31T14:42:21-0400", "location_id": "10384235", "id": "413313408", "user": {"username": "alorlovsky27", "user_location": {"name": "Appleton, Wisconsin", "id": "30330"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great place to get everything you need to pamper your pet", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60168-d10384235-r413108142-m11068-The_Pampurr_d_Pet-Oshkosh_Wisconsin.html#review413108142", "text": "I have never met someone who loves and cares about her pets more than Kristi. she is very knowledgeable in all things pets.
