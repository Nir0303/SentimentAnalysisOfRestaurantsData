I ordered the Pad Thai and we shared an appetizer platter. All the food on the platter was excellent. I poured the leftover sauce on the Pad Thai as it was a bit bland for my taste. With the spicy sauce, it was delicious. Everyone seems to thoroughly enjoy their meals. \n\nSome outdoor seating....inside is quite tiny, maybe 8 to 10 tables. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-09-26T11:28:51-0400", "location_id": "2255370", "id": "313832175", "user": {"username": "GrannyJules218", "user_location": {"name": "Brainerd, Minnesota", "id": "42891"}}}]}
