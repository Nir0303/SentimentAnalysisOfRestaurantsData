They really work hard to present the work of local artists in a way to showcase and promote the regions art. I am really impressed with the wide variety of work and the affordable price range. All workers are volunteers, most have work in the Gallery, and are enthusiastic about their art. They also have events to feature artists where the public can meet artists and socialize. I have taken classes here. Very affordable, lots of fun. Great information. Come here first if you are looking for artwork for your office, home, or a gift for a friend.
