All the regular sandwich shops and non-fast food restaurants were packed so we kept looking.  We came upon the Hungry Bear Restaurant and walked in.  There was not a sole there and we were concerned about the option, but since we were hungry, we sat down.  It is an Alaska rustic atmosphere and has seating for about 25.  We were waited in by the owner, her husband did the cooking, and were received with a great deal of energy and enthusiasm.  She made sure our experience was great!  She did not disappoint us with the meal suggestions.  The food was GREAT and the prices reasonable.
