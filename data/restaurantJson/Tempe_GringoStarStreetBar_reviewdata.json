WE get there and the 2 game systems are in use and never released for anyone else to play Mario kart!  \n\nThen i get ready to order some TOTROS (tater tot nachos) from the menu and they no longer exist.... but there are regular nachos (not on the menu)  I ask if its possible to do the nachos and add tater tots to them .... and apparently that is an impossible task!
