The bathroom was modern, crisp, clean and larger than I expected.  Every detail was so thought out, from the make up remover towelets,  tons of fluffy towels, hand lotion, toothpaste, Tylenol, bottles of water, candy dishes everywhere for the midnight snack run. There is also a snack buffet in the dining room with home made cookies, fresh fruit, coffee and tea. There was nothing left to wish for!\nThere is outdoor seating on the porch for a nice cup of coffee.\nMargit and Bob were such gracious hosts.
