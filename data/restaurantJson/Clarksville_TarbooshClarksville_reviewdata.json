I got the gyro plate, with rice, and pita bread. When I got my food, everything was cooked well. Although I was surprised that the gyro meat was a slab and sliced like a steak and not like at other greek cafe's/restaurants, where it is cut up. The meat didn't seem to be seasoned as well either. Overall I was disappointed and was expecting more. Service was nice that they delivered, and they were nice on the phone, but the food was not what I was expecting.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-04-06T09:21:23-0400", "location_id": "4887401", "id": "362066714", "user": {"username": "VintagePhotoGirl", "user_location": {"name": "Clarksville, Tennessee", "id": "54955"}}}]}
