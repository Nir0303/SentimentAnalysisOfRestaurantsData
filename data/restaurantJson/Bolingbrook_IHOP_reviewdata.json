We went there in the afternoon on the Monday following X-Mas, and the waiting area was packed with folks in line to be seated. Many of the tables and booths in the restaurant were available, so it must have been a staffing issue, either not enough servers or not enough cooks to meet demand. From a customer standpoint, (with \"stand\" being the operative word) I'd rather be seated comfortably at an empty table and be able to view the menu, chat with my companions, and have a glass of water or quick cup of coffee while I wait for a server, than to have to stand around at the front of the restaurant with a crowd of people all also waiting to be seated, jockeying for position, having to get out of the way for others to pass. (Presuming the host/hostess notifies us that it could take a while to place our orders or get our food.) It took about 10-15 minutes for the two of us to be seated, again, with about half of the tables empty, so they must not have expected the crowd on a Monday afternoon, long after breakfast/lunchtime. Our server was very friendly and talkative, if a bit ditsy. Definitely gets points for sweetness. (A quick note----We've had her on a previous visit, at which time she'd brought our beverages and taken our order, then forgotten about us until our meal was over. Another employee brought out our food, but we were missing some items, and couldn't catch anyone's attention to tell them. We ran out of a half-full carafe of coffee after less than 3 cups, needed more Equal, napkins, and no one ever stopped by to see how our meal was or if we needed drink refills. There were at least 2 management-types and 2 hostesses walking around, but we couldn't catch their attention, either. The busiest-looking, most attentive employee to walk past our table was the busboy, who didn't speak English. Our server came by after about 30 mins. and said, \"I noticed it looked like you didn't get your bacon or gravy, I'll have my mgr. take it off the bill.\" Well, if you'd noticed that, why didn't you stop and ASK us while we were still eating?! I'd rather have had all my food items to improve the meal than the cost credit on an incomplete plate. It bears mention that this friendly, talkative server had 2 new arrivals seated into the booth right behind us, and she must have known them, as she proceeded to get into a lengthy conversation with them about college or some such, after taking their order. When she was done chatting, she turned and walked away so weren't able to catch her eye then, either. We chalked up that visit to inexperience. Now, back to our return visit.) She was polite as before, got our drinks right away, and took our order. She actually came back a few minutes later to check on us. (Our drinks) After about 10-15 more minutes, the food hadn't yet arrived, but we'd kind of expected that. My husband was just messing with his phone, and I was digging around in my purse, taking my wallet out to look for something, and the server came over and asked us if everything had been fine today. I said, \"How do you mean?\" and she replied, \"With your food, how was your meal?\" We explained that we were still waiting for our food. She seemed surprised, and said we looked like we were preparing to leave. We repeated that we hadn't yet eaten. She seemed confused, and we asked her to check on our food. She came out 2 mins. later with our food, which made us tend to think it had been sitting back there prepared and just waiting for someone to bring it to us before it got cold. At least, this time everything was there. The remainder of the meal was uneventful. Food was good, service Ehhhhhh. Interestingly, this time a management-type stopped by the table to ask how things were, but began to walk away before we even finished answering, as if she wasn't really interested in the response, she was just fulfilling a requirement. And no smile from her. Wild!! We'll keep going back because it's convenient, and hope that they get better at everything, but we noticed Sophie's in the old IHOP building so we'll be giving her a try.
