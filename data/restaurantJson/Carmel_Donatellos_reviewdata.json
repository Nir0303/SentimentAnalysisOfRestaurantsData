The Lasagna rolls were visibly overcooked and difficult to eat.  The flavor inside was good.  Maybe overcooked is the way it is served, but if the cook didn't catch it, you would have thought the server would.  \nThe Alfredo sauce was also overcooked and the parmesan was grainy within the sauce.  It was all settled on the bottom of the bowl.  I almost said something, but we decided to let it go.  \nThe pasta was really the best part of the meal.  It was cooked well and the presentation was good.  The server asked us if we wanted parmesan on the pasta.  I thought that she would grate it on like you normally see, however it was just dropped off in a dish.\nFor just two of us splitting an appetizer, salad and a meal, the bill came up to $50.

We had to keep asking for drink refills.  We requested our meals from the waiter but nothing.  The meals finally came out 1 1/2 hours later. Food was good but not worth the wait.

IT is located on the Main St. of downtown Carmel, IN.  The decor is done in an industrial theme in red and black.  It does have white tablecloths, but it is fine to wear jeans.  \nThe menu has a good variety of different items, and there is plenty to order if you don't want pasta.  My husband had the special which was a poached Salmon with a lemon caper sauce, side vegetables, which he did like, however was average.  \nA BORING iceberg diner salad came first.  The salad ($4.00) consisted of chopped iceberg lettuce, two wedges of tomato, a cucumber slice and two thick large pieces of red onion.  The plate was cold which indicated these salads had been sitting in the refrigerator.  I would not pay again for the dinner salad, nor would I even bother having it served to me again for free....nothing different than what you would get in a cheap diner. The salad dressing tasted like it was out of a bottle.  The bread was awful, white bread that comes out of the tube in the cold section of the grocery, presliced and then baked....no flavor, it was disappointing....it seems that with salad and bread they are really cutting corners trying to save a few dollars.  Neither one are worth even tasting.\nI had the tortellini with pink sauce.  It had bacon in the sauce, it was good, but the onion was not chopped well and was in large hunks, which seemed unusual.   None of the pastas are homemade,  but it was cooked well.  Dessert was excellent.  I had what they called an \"Italian\" white cake with a coconut cream cheese frosting.  It was excellent, but made me wonder why the bread was so bad, since they bake the cake there at the restaurant.  \nThe service was average to good.  They were overly anxious to clear dishes, even though we weren't done eating.  I am not sure about the week days, but on a Friday evening we needed reservations and we were there early (6pm)  Even though we had made reservations early in the day they lead us to a table (many other empty tables) that was facing directly into the kitchen.  It was as though we were eating right there in the kitchen and extremely noisy  We asked to be moved which they did do.  \nTo summarize the main dishes and dessert were good but the salad and bread was very disappointing.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-06T13:06:02-0400", "location_id": "2318008", "id": "227353595", "user": {"username": "bahlrichs", "user_location": {"name": "Carmel, Indiana", "id": "36990"}}}]}
