Long ago I recommended they try LaVazza which in my opinion if fresh and made right beats Starbucks by a mile. Definitely it makes the best espresso! \nThey took my advice but for some reason they do not feature it as their premier coffee which is a shame. It just costs a quarter more, just fifteen minutes on the meter outside. I do so wish the new part owners would carry it in decaf now that I have to drink decaf. I get around it by requesting an expresso Americano Decaf as frankly their house decaf is no better than Mickey D's in my opinion.\nA little background music like Starbucks has would be nice as well. Overall for an independently owned place it has come a long way. Unlike any other caf\u00e9s it has a frequent visiting  portrait artist who used to draw at the old Caribou. You can see  portraits of Bean and Leaf Customers displayed at the rear. Great for students and chit chat with friends I highly recommend trying it now that it has improved. The choices for breakfast could improve but I was told they do not want to be a restaurant which does not make sense to me if one would like something to go with coffee other than a continental croissant, or instant oatmeal (yuch),  However,they do offer pre wrapped sandwiches for lunch that are a good value compared to some coney islands.\nThey also offer vegan sunrise cakes that are so tasty and for the young at heart the ever popular bubble tea.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-03-24T21:22:23-0400", "location_id": "1198850", "id": "358335235", "user": {"username": "Wolfman48067", "user_location": {"name": "Royal Oak, Michigan", "id": "42660"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Nice Vibe, Spacious, Good Tea Selection", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42660-d1198850-r349622332-m11068-Bean_Leaf_Cafe-Royal_Oak_Michigan.html#review349622332", "text": "I tend to prefer independent coffeehouses to the big chains.
