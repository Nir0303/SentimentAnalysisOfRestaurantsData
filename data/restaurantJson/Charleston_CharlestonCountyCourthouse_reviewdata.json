The 'Historic Court House' sits upon the location of the original, which partially burned.  The Colonial SC Commons House of Assembly met here (on the 2nd floor) to run the business of the colony and eventually discuss how to handle situations like Stamp Act (amongst others, which eventually influenced the SC transition from Colony to Statehood.)  A kiosk display on the first floor details  the history of the site.  The physical walls of the building are lined with copies of portraits of people who had a positive impact in South Carolina, all collected into one place. Honestly, a better presentation could easily be managed here by framing and labeling each portrait  (not just tacked paper to the wall) with a  short biography attached beneath, highlighting each person's significance.  For example, when I visited, a replica  of Alan Ramsay's  portrait of 'Peter Manigault', Speaker of the Commons House of Assembly 1765- 1772 (Joseph Manigault's father -  see Joseph Manigault House and the Charleston Museum)  was hanging in the stairwell, adjacent to the Palladian window, but it was not labeled.  If you know nothing about Mr. Manigault, you'd pass it by thinking nothing of it, or 'Who was that?\")    \n\nVisitors are permitted to the second floor to have a look around.  Here you will find  more historic portraits, 2 still- in-use court rooms which can be walked through, and a gorgeous library (for display).  \n\nThe architecture of the building is lovely, the Palladian windows highlighting the back wall.\n\nI highly, highly recommended for a stop inside the Historic Courthouse, especially if you are doing a historic tour of Charleston. The history and architecture of the building are wonderful! it is definitely worth your while!\n\nPlan for 20 min- half hour.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-01-31T10:28:42-0500", "location_id": "293592", "id": "192692758", "user": {"username": "chezcalais", "user_location": {"name": "South Hills, Pennsylvania", "id": "53719"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-12", "title": "Cool", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g54171-d293592-r147397526-m11068-Charleston_County_Courthouse-Charleston_South_Carolina.html#review147397526", "text": "I didn't go inside, but enjoyed the architecture of the outside.
