When we entered, the place looked nice enough - comfortable, clean. The staff behind the counter were prompt to greet us, and encouraged us to take counter seats while we looked the menu over. Everyone who left the kitchen greeted us in a friendly manner. We made our orders, brought them home, and dug in. I believe I got the Orange Chicken, I'm not sure what my husband chose. Unfortunately, neither of us was impressed with our meals. My chicken was sliced thin and a bit dry or tough, and his food was rather bland. The only memorable thing about our meals turns out to be how disappointing they were. I was really hoping to enjoy their food, they're in the perfect location for us, but even for a Phoenician it's impossible for me to recommend them to anyone. Their staff was terrific, but their kitchen needs new recipes or better prep practices. When we're in the mood for Chinese, we've chosen to head further East on Peoria road, instead.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-20T13:12:18-0400", "location_id": "4658448", "id": "365796096", "user": {"username": "AmeWil", "user_location": {"name": "Chandler, Arizona", "id": "31190"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "I Can No Longer Recommend", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31308-d4658448-r353205993-m11068-Wong_s_JR-Peoria_Arizona.html#review353205993", "text": "I left a previous review that I wanted to update,  but wasn't able to so here's a new one. \n\nAfter eating here frequently for years,  I was greeted at the door and told I could not eat there with my service dog, who has been with me every other time.
