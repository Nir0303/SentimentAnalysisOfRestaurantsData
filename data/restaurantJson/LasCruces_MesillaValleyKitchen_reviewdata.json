The potatoes were cooked well, with a crispy outer texture, but still soft and fluffy in the middle. The potatoes also had bacon, which can never be a bad thing. 2 of my friends ordered the daily breakfast special, which was biscuits and gravy on the day we visited. They both reported that their meals were excellent. The third friend ordered a basic egg plate with a side of bacon. The egg plate was well made, and pretty much what you'd expect. The \"side\" of bacon, however, was massive, and he ended up eating his fill and having enough slices leftover to share with the rest of us. Definitely a good value/large portion.

Breakfast burritos for the big appetite as well as daily specials listed on the outside chalkboard. Offerings for vegetarians like the Ultimate Grilled Cheese ( on whole wheat form me) with two cheeses, apple slices, avocado, lettuce and tomatoe-yum! My other favorite is the Crunchy Bird--grilled chicken breast with cream cheese, sesame seeds and sprouts. Hearty burgers, green chile on many selections, even salads. If you are really hungry you can get one their giant cookies. The wait staff is quick to fill up your glass when you drink it down.  Friendly and efficient.
