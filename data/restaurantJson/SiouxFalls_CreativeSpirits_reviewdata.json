The picture design is chosen for you, but you can make alterations to it. It was fun to see the variations of other painters. It was nearly sold out (Friday night) so it was pretty cramped - more space would've been appreciated. Also, we were given an area at the back for us to put wine and snacks we brought for our birthday group, but others assumed they were provided by the venue and started eating/drinking, so we ended up having to place them on our already cramped tables.
