And not just a house, but a home filled with anything that your mind and heart could wish to be designed for yourself or someone special. These beautifully designed pieces when worn make a statement and are eye catching to everyone. The artist and designer Linda is such a beautiful graceful lady and just has this way of knowing what your looking for and if she hasn't already designed it she will design it for you. The sweet ladies who work here are so helpful and take time to show you everything . I have bought several gorgeous pieces,\nMy favorite is the beautiful coin pendants, and the freshwater pearl leather collection and numerous other gifts for my family and friends.
