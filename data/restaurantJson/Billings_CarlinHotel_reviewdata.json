If you closed the bedroom door or bathroom there was frost that built up on the inside of the window. The microwave made a sound that sounded like it would exsplode at anytime and when we told \"management\" they said oh yah its broken we'll be ordering one. Also several floor boards coming up and I actually cut my foot. The sheets had a whole in them the coverlet was covered with stains and the window curtains where all broken and couldn't be closed. Towel rod coming off the wall oh yes and my favorite. No NO extra toilet paper rolls and there was maybe a fourth of a roll left when we came. No garbage sacks, no hand soap, listed this and more, and when we where able to get ahold of the manager, she said oh I will have to talk to the owners about compensation.(OK how about you just fixing the problems and some good old fashion customer service) Oh goodie ! And they did a whopping 30.00!!!!!!! We are from Billings and wont be suggesting or care to grace the doors of the Carlin Hotel. To bad it could have been such a wonderful hotel had it been what was described and shown in the pictures.

Stephanie, the manager, made us feel welcome immediately.  A spectacular alternative to the Crowne Plaza. The rooms are spacious, clean, with full kitchen, newly appointed bathrooms, comfortable beds.  There was plenty of space in 304 in which to set up a warroom of business activity, complete with our laptops, two printers, and boxes of court trial materials.  With no hotel reservation receptionist, we did hire a messenger to assist us in transporting our boxes of materials from the Fed Express office on 27th avenue to our hotel.  Cody, our messenger, was superb-- 406-652-1182 if you wish to hire him.  I cannot praise enough the Fed Ex employees, who created blowups, boxes, copies and shipped things for us.  Unbelievably great service -- 406-252-6265. See the addtl reviewer's comments re Saturday night noise from the nightclub, and on one Saturday nite the reverberations were intense, but we found the entire experience to be excellent.  Trains passing did not bother any of us. Visit LILAC for delicious food, and McCormicks for tasty breakfasts, so very close by.

After 10pm they charge a cover fee of $3 (I guess to pay the DJ??). On our last visit (and it will be our last visit ever) the lady at the door that takes the cover and issues wrist bands put a band on one of our friends wrists whom immediately announced it was a little tight for his comfort. She put her finger under it and said if her finger fits it is fine. (Who is she to determine what another persons comfort level is?) \n\nAnyway, she stated if your band comes off, you will be charged the cover again. I can see them saying that to minimize hassles of re-issuing a band. \n\nThe band was bothering our friend and, as he fidgeted with it, it popped apart. We thought, no big deal. Just go up and get it replaced (especially since he initially stated it was uncomfortable so she should remember him). \n\nWell, she charged him $3 again knowing good we he had already paid. \n\nConsidering their drinks are certainly not a bargain and we typically spend $70+ each visit on drinks alone, we felt they were being petty to charge for a replacement wrist band in this case. \n\nAnyway, it seemed petty to us and not an example of good customer service so we are not patronizing them anymore. \n\nSo if you are on the lookout for businesses that put their customers first, join us in taking your business elsewhere.", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2009-05-02T12:59:45-0400", "location_id": "283503", "id": "29197617", "user": {"username": "MTConsumer", "user_location": {"name": "Billings, MT", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2007-03", "title": "GREAT place with one detail that you might not like", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45086-d283503-r7187388-m11068-Carlin_Hotel-Billings_Montana.html#review7187388", "text": "The \"hotel\" is actually the 3rd floor of a renovated building on Montana Avenue - a trendy street renovated and now occupied by shops, eating establishment, and nighclubs.

Q Cuisine is a stylish restaurant offering a variety of items but I remember some of the focus was on pasta.  The St. Louis ribs are very unique.  The meat was cooked perfectly but the heavy orange flavored BBQ sauce was a bit overpowering.  Also on the 1st floor, next to the Q, is the Carlin nightclub.

If you are a light sleeper and are staying here, you HAVE to stay in one of the front 2 rooms. The only down side is the train that goes through town (see Crown Plaza reviews regarding train noise in Billings).  On a plus side, if you stay there, you never pay a cover.
