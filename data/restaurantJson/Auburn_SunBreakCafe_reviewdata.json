They want you to know this.  \n\nThis little restaurant is very popular and very expensive, neither of which is justified, in my opinion.  It's a lot of food of course but sometimes I'd like to just pay for the one meal I ordered, rather than the 2-3 meals they bring you.  Their food is what you'd expect from a breakfast place but of the three meals I've tried, none were over the top incredible.  If their prices were $3-$4 less I'd come here more often, but then the lines would be even longer, so maybe not.  I've never been there where there wasn't a line out the door, so they're clearly doing something right.  The service was quite friendly and the little store in the front is very cute and a nice diversion if you're lucky enough to have someone in your party hold your place in line while you browse.  Last time I was there, I browsed for about 10 minutes and when I came back the line hadn't moved at all, so we left.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-13T07:54:10-0400", "location_id": "464087", "id": "392102753", "user": {"username": "lololives", "user_location": {"name": "Tacoma", "id": null}}}]}
