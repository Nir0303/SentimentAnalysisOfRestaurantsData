Several months ago, I made several attempts over several days to call in an order for pick-up. No one ever answered the phone! There was no voicemail or anything.

Their website at the time indicated they did take out orders and I had placed at least a half dozen orders previously.   Turns out, they stopped doing take out orders (the website has been updated since). For some reason, they felt a good way to stop doing take-out orders is to simply not answer the phone when I called. When I finally was frustrated enough to leave a review on Yelp, somebody who worked there posted that they stopped doing take out orders, due to a small kitchen.   I get it, if they're so busy they can't do take out orders, it's great that they're so successful. The way they handled it was poor, and I definitely felt as if they \"didn't need\" my business.
