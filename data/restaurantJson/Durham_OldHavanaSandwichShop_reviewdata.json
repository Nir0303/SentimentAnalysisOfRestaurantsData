Since I moved out of Florida, I had been disappointed in the Cuban cuisine in other cities, including Durham.  Now Durham has a fabulous place for authentic Cuban cuisine and atmosphere!  Old Havana Sandwich Shop is the real deal.  I felt like I was back in Ybor City!  I went for lunch and had their Havana Cuban sandwich and a refreshing homemade pineapple/mint homemade soda.  The bread was fresh and pressed to crunchy perfection.  Inside was the utter essence of Cuban sandwiches -- lots of melt-in-your-mouth moist and chopped roasted pork (local!), subtle melted cheese, the perfect pickles and mojo sauce, a nice slice of a special ham, and lastly, the mustard.  Heaven!  And the soda was just the right light mild sweetness -- almost a mojito, and a great balance to the sandwich.  The atmosphere feels like the streets of old Ybor City -- friendly, down-to-earth, slow and easy.  There's a small group of easy chairs in one section for hanging out and drinking Cuban espresso.  The owner was cooking and greeting when I went in today, and the service was quick and efficient.  They have taken best advantage of the latest Square technology to make order placement at the counter quick and painless.  And their website is fabulous.  You can set up an account and order takeout in great detail, which I plan to do when I don't have time to go enjoy the wonderful atmosphere inside.  This just became my go-to place in Durham!

I am not a pork eater so I had the vegetarian plate. The total for my food was $9.14.  When my plate arrived it had a tiny little salad on it, maybe 1/2 cup of rice, a few beans in a bowl, and maybe 10 plantains (the best part in my opinion). The food was fresh and tasty but I felt like there could've been a little bit more food on the plate for the price. My companions all got some type of pork sandwiches and their sandwiches looked good but plain.  I believe they paid about the same for a sandwich only.  If you are really hungry and on the budget then this probably isn't the place for you. If you want to be hip and try something new and don't care about the prices then you will feel right at home here. \n\nOne last thing, if you are vegetarian, make sure you pay attention to what is and what isn't cooked in lard. I believe the hushpuppies and plantain chips are fried in lard.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-04-01T18:17:50-0400", "location_id": "2630625", "id": "360780631", "user": {"username": "Alison U", "user_location": {"name": "North, South Carolina", "id": "54368"}}}]}
