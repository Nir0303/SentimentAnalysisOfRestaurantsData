There's something about the way the staff is standing there (a whole family?). It just feels like they one day thought, \"Hey we can do the same as Teavana and get rich fast!\" They only sell their tea in tins, since I am an avid tea consumer, I already have a vast collection of tins, besides the fact that an old-fashioned paper bag is much more environmentally friendly; they said that the tin was free, so who's paying for that tin? That tin would end up in the recycle or trash, I just want some tea in a bag please, is that too much to ask for? They refused my request, and all stared at me like I was a nasty customer, so I left. There's another cute tea shop in Frederick, with knowledgeable, sweet people. I'd like my tea without an attitude.
