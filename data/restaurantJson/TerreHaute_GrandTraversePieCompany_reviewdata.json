I truly enjoyed the Mediterranean Quiche and would surely go back for that again if we were closer though. We also tried the Apple Pecan Caramel pie and the Peach Pie. If I had the chance to choose again id just get Peach Pie all the way and maybe even buy an extra to bring home too \u263a\ufe0f it was delicious! This place is worth a stop and affordable, just don't expect it to make you swoon. \ud83d\ude09", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-13T17:12:45-0400", "location_id": "3330559", "id": "392329440", "user": {"username": "AmyJ714", "user_location": {"name": "Wichita, Kansas", "id": "39143"}}}]}
