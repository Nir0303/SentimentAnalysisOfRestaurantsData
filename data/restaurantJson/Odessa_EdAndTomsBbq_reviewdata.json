Chopped Brisket Sandwiches were AMAZING, and we also had brisket smothered baked potatoes which were extremely filling and the portions were very generous.  Looks like it started as a food truck, then moved into a brick building.  Parking lot is a little small, prepare to park on side of road, but they will take care of you.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-20T11:55:56-0400", "location_id": "11621138", "id": "430111107", "user": {"username": "BigRobUTSA", "user_location": {"name": "Odessa, Texas", "id": "56385"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Good BBQ and Good People", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56385-d11621138-r424534483-m11068-Ed_And_Toms_Bbq-Odessa_Texas.html#review424534483", "text": "I met the owners at the Permian Basin Fair and I am glad I did.
