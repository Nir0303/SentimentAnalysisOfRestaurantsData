It is a perfect location to walk to the bus and then back from the after race party. Even tough the hotel is fine - nothing special,  every year we would make our reservations for the following July to stay again - this year we were told we couldn't but the reason was unclear and we should call in January.  I called today, thinking maybe whatever the issue was would be straightened out and I could make my reservation.  Turns out, the General Manager decided to make a change the policy for the Boilermaker weekend. I spoke with him today.  He blocked off some rooms for sponsors (?) and they are all full.I asked when I should have called for one of those rooms and why I couldn't book the day we were there and he had no answer for either of those.    For the rest of the rooms, he has decided to make it a two night minimum.  I'm sure that anyone who has run the race knows, as well as he does, that most runners come in on Saturday and check out after the race Sunday.  This is nothing but a blatant attempt to get an extra $200 or so dollars out of people he knows will only be there one night.  When I asked him to explain the policy - he refused.  I have stayed at this hotel for years an am disgusted at the treatment I received today and this decision to try to rip me off.  Thankfully, I was able to reserve a room down the street. I am very disappointed in this manager's treatment of a long time customer and his absolute refusal to even try to explain.
