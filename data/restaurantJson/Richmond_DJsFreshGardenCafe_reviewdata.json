Its a deli that looks kinda run down, and unfortunately not in a cute/hip-sorta way. You enter through the building entrance so after you get past the concierge, you enter some asian/deli/fried chicken spot. I got a turkey sandwich and my girl got a BLT. Both were not bad, but with iceberg lettuce its nothing you can't put together at home. Toasted bread and decent chip selections, but atmosphere is like a laboratory. Maybe try something else (deep fried?) and get it to-go.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-07-11T09:47:38-0400", "location_id": "395375", "id": "134116719", "user": {"username": "customcustomer", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
