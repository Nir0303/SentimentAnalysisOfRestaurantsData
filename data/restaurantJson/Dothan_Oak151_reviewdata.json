All four dishes on our table were delicious and enjoyed by all: Shrimp & Grits, the Oak Burger, the Breakfast sandwich, Chicken & Waffles, and cinnamon rolls. I'm not from the area, but I know this is a different kind of dining and atmosphere from most restaurants in town. It's a little more upscale, yet casual dining with a hip vibe. The foods are all very freshly prepared, the dishes well executed, and good service. Our only complaint was the wait time between ordering and receiving or meal. We felt the kitchen could have been more efficient for the crowd, which is why I went with 4 stars instead of 5. I would definitely eat here again, especially to try lunch/dinner items.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-07-12T10:47:43-0400", "location_id": "7722872", "id": "288242168", "user": {"username": "Emma B", "user_location": {"name": "Birmingham, Alabama", "id": "30375"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "A Gem in Downtown Dothan, AL", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30488-d7722872-r255072300-m11068-Oak_151-Dothan_Alabama.html#review255072300", "text": "We pass through Dothan, AL every spring, and Oak 151 is our #1 restaurant destination for lunch.  Oak 151  is housed in a charming old cream city brick building with fantastic courtyard outdoor seating. The wait staff is so welcoming and friendly, and the food is scrumptious!  Our favorite starter is their homemade hummus and pita bread. Another favorite is their mouth-watering, homemade red pepper with Gouda soup. Their lunch sandwiches and salads are always a special treat, too.  Many sides are offered with their entrees, including their hot, flavorful homemade potato chips and jalape\u00f1o slaw. Oak 151 offers daily specials that are creative and delicious, created and prepared by chef and owner. We never visit Dothan without a visit to Oak 151 and can guarantee you a fabulous lunch if you stop, too!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-02-18T12:28:13-0500", "location_id": "7722872", "id": "255072300", "user": {"username": "Sue455", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
