However, I do NOT recommend eating outdoors.  After a recent trip to the restaurant, my friend and I both got eaten alive by mosquitoes.  I am not kidding you when I say that we EACH have 10-12 mosquito bites on our feet/ankles/legs.\n\nYes, I know that it's the summer and it's mosquito season, but if you're an established restaurant who attracts many customers due to the ability to enjoy dining outdoors, you need to invest in spraying your property for bugs/mosquitoes!!  This is ridiculous!!  Take some responsibility or atleast warn your guests that the mosquitoes have been bad and may want to consider eating in doors.  Had I known this, we would have enjoyed our meal inside the restaurant.\n\nI have been miserable and uncomfortable for days now since our visit to El Meson.  All that said, it was definitely not worth the food or money.  My advice to anyone considering dining at this restaurant, DO NOT eat on their patio unless they can confirm and assure you that they have professionally sprayed and are managing their bug issue.
