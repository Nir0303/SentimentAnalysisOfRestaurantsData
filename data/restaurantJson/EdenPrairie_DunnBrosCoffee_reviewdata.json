The egg sandwich is too expensive and the size is comparable to any of the other egg sandwiches at fast food places. While it's a cool building and we've been there many times for tea, it's difficult to have a combersation because the rooms echo if there are lots of people there.  Sometimes it's difficult to find seating because there are lots of singles there occupying a table alone with their laptops and a cup of coffee.
