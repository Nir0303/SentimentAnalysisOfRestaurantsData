So, when we found out Kimpton was putting in a hotel on the first six or seven floors, we had high hopes.\n\nAnd the company did not disappoint.\n\nThe Cardinal is a stylish, stunning addition to the Winston-Salem hotel scene, with a beautiful restaurant/bar/raw bar, lovely lobby, incredible game level, well-appointed rooms (who would think that magnolia blossoms actually look good with deer antlers?) and, of course, Kimpton hospitality -- coffee in the morning, wine in the afternoons and all-day dog treats for your canine friends.\n\nWe have a canine friend -- an old, big dog -- so we also love that Kimpton welcomes pets regardless of size (some people may not like this, so if encountering a large dog in the lobby is not your thing, be aware it could happen). Although they accept animals, the room we stayed in was fresh and fabulous, no trace of animal smells.\n\nIf anything, even though the entire hotel is non-smoking, I did smell a faint trace of tobacco in the room. It could have been a noncompliant guest, or maybe, just a whiff of the ghosts of tobacco past; this is the R.J. Reynolds building, after all.\n\nDid not use the fantastic amenities on the basement floor but did have appetizers and brunch in the restaurant, and both are recommended. \n\nKimpton did a fantastic job on the renovations, modernizing without destroying the beauty of this architectural masterpiece.\n\nBravo. Can't wait to return.\n\np.s. I have to say I stupidly left a piece of electronics in my room and when I noticed it was missing weeks later, I called and they had it.

Disappointing, irritating--I'll never come back here unless there's new management.\n\n1.  Advised them I was arriving after midnight when I booked online. When I arrive exhausted, they say they downgraded me because I had requested a room away from elevator. When I say I want the bigger room that I booked, they admit they no longer have the room available. When I ask for what the new room rate is, they do not give the information except to say the bill will be adjusted\n2. Took 4 trips to desk to get working door cards. The last time, clerk fails to see I had paid for late check-out so that card became non-functional after 12 noon on check out day.\n3.  On the day of check-out at 11am, a staff person knocks on the door and wants to know when I will be leaving.  I tell her that I paid for late check out (per the website this is good until 3pm). She still insists on knowing when we would be leaving.\n   At check-out clerk implies I was upgraded. I correct her that I was downgraded and I wanted to know what the room rate charge was. She says $30 was removed from the bill and because I did not use the honor bar, removed an additional $10.\n   I was charged for the queen queen premier AAA rate,  $230/night.  On review of their website for the last night I stayed, it was $195 for the same room\n4. The room while beautiful and large cannot accommodate 2 people on business. It had 1 sink, 1 towel rack, 1 towel hook, 1 chair (for desk), a closet that had 4 ft wide usable space, 2 drawers the size of a small file cabinet in the closet. The walk in shower had 2 shower heads and could easily fit 6 people inside- go figure. Website said the room would have 2 HDTV and a comfortable chair but the chair was missing and there was only 1 TV.\n5. Honor bar was missing several items on arrival\n6. Door to room is very heavy but still inadequate in blocking corridor noise out. In fact, you can hear doors slamming because they're difficult to control due to the weight.\n7. Lighting in the room is inadequate to do work. There is a large 4 ft desk but you're given a single bulb desk lamp. There is a torchier and a 2 bulb soft light between the beds.  The bathroom has bright lights so you can see what you look like before you leave the room.\n8. Using the room thermostat is not easy.  There are no written instructions. Had to have someone from engineering explain the system. Advice for warmth- set the temp and make certain fan is off and thermostat is on \"warm mode\"\n9. The beautiful lounge is not set up to do business work, when you can't stand being in your room. Chair/sofa height to tables are ergonomically poor.  Not to mention the location of the electrical plugs are limiting where you might work.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "KCHFO, Front Office Manager at The Kimpton Cardinal Hotel, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for your review Uzengirl,\n\nI am so sorry that your stay was not up to par.
