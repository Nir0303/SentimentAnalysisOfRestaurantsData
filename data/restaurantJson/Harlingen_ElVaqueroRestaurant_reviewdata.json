My wife, 99 year old father-in-law, and I entered the restaurant and sat at the only available table which happened to be next to the front door at 12:32 p.m. Sunday afternoon. On one hand we were encouraged at how busy the restaurant were therefore expecting great food. But, on the other hand, we were disappointed to experience a very noisy atmosphere. We were coping with the noise while waiting 5 to 10 minutes before any wait staff came to our table. Finally we were greeted by the manager and or owner who presented us with menus while welcoming and thanking us for choosing this restaurant. He said, \"your waiter will be here soon, although I don't know who it is\". Hmm... Someone brought complementary chips and salsa and we then waited close to 15 minutes for the unknown server. We ordered water to drink and placed our meal order. The water arrived after another 5-10 minutes. THEN the REAL wait began. As time went by, our server NEVER returned to our table to check on us, offer water refills, or explain the delay in getting our food. 58 minutes had passed since we sat down and another 40 minutes since placing our order plus no further visits from our server. In frustration we rose and slowly walked out. This was our first and most likely our last visit.
