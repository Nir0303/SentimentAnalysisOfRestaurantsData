(There are two in the area. The other one is better.) I had to pull into the parking lot to turn around and the guards there refused to let me leave without paying them for an hour first. I was there only long enough to make a u-turn and they basically extorted $3 from me for parking. The parking machines were broken, so I couldn't use a credit card and I didn't have any cash on me because the DoubleTree I was supposed to be going to said it had free parking. I was already late, so I didn't have time to make a fuss or run around looking for an ATM, so I had to search my vehicle until I could find enough spare change to get them to let me out of the parking lot. \n\nIt's not about the money. I can afford $3. It's about the rudeness, the selfishness, the humiliation, the inconvenience, and the total lack of customer service. I was basically lost in Delaware and rather than showing an ounce of concern for me as a customer, the hotel parking staff took advantage of that just to make a $3 profit. \n\nThe staff at the other DoubleTree seemed much nicer and they had free parking, but because of this experience, it's unlikely that I'll ever be staying at one of their hotels in the future.

Now living in Cocoa, I took the train (avoiding planes for now) and researched the hotel closest to the Wilmington Amtrak station - which is Double Tree.  Upon arriving, I called the hotel to ask if they had shuttle service.  They most certainly do - and the amazing Mark arrived to pick me up.  Promptly.  He's a charming, fascinating man who knows the city's history very well.  I had four more journeys with Mark while staying with the hotel - and each one was a delight.  He's a credit to the company!  Also - I need to mention Megan at the front desk.  When I perused my room for the first time, I was impressed with the elegant simplicity of the layout.  Since I am now a \"rewards\" member, I was on the floor that caters to them.  I had a small problem which was instantly rectified by Megan - and she proceeded to show me kindness and thoughtfulness consistently throughout my visit.  On top of WONDERFUL servers in their dining room - one, a Mom of five who couldn't have been sweeter - I received a letter from an Executive at Double Tree.  She thanked me for staying at her hotel and asked how they could do better.  Guess what?  They can't.  They're already THERE!  I had a terrible time getting business done while I'm Wilmington (lesson learned: drop Wells Fargo immediately) - but at least I've discovered where I am going to stay from this time forward.

So very pleasant and such great personalities! Lovely to check-in at the hotel with having their smiling faces and willingness to do anything to make my stay enjoyable. I told them that I was only there for a few hours and had to wake up early for a meeting. As a Diamond member, they were on a mission to make sure those few hours were great. Well when I woke up this morning, that all changed unfortunately because of one bad apple - I'm not a believer that one person should ruin my rating, but her unprofessional attitude and the way she just made me feel so uncomfortable needs to be addressed. I received a voucher for a free breakfast and asked her if I could get a to-go box because I was a little rushed for time and needed to eat on the go. It was 6:30am and no one was in the restaurant. She then scolded me and asked why I needed it to go and rolled her eyes at me and denied my request. I continued to be nice and EVEN apologized that my simple request got her so mad but she remained so very mean and belittled me. Never in my life, especially never at a Hilton resort - have I ever been so badly treated. She then said \"fine but what do you want\" - I told her I just wanted eggs to go and she went back to get me silverware. I was so upset that when she turned away, I literally walked right out very upset because I didn't want to hear what she was going to say next. I completely lost my appetite and didn't want to be around this negativity. Very, very disappointing and NOT a good representation of Hilton customer service.
