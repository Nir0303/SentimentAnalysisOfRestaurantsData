Our room was on the executive level (and I would recommend calling and requesting that because I understand they are in the middle of renovations and these rooms are finished.)

In our case, it is for incidentals-- i.e., damage is caused to the room and the cost of which is greater than what your card was initially authorized for. Additionally, it proves that the card was physically here in our possession. This prevents identity theft and protects both our and your rights.\nI understand your fear that your credit card information may be stolen because we have it, however, I assure you that we take all steps possible to keep it secure. The employees which work behind the front counter are all deemed trustworthy by management and are subject to background checks prior to hiring, and the imprinted registration cards are kept secure.

Upon check-in, front desk was delightful & very helpful. Nice to see a smiling face after driving for awhile. Hot Breakfast included with a wide selection, scrambled eggs, waffles, oatmeal, grits, bagels, fruits, juices, coffee, etc. Rooms are quiet, cool, comfortable, a little small, clean, and out dated. I would give it an excellent if it was not for two things. Check-out lady was not friendly, she was not rude, \" just doing my job\" attitude. My other complaint was that hotel guest were hanging out by the entrance & smoking. We had to walk through a cloud of smoke to enter. The hotel needs to address this issue and enforce a designated smoking area away from the entrance. We would definitely stay here again. If you go for a college visit there is a special rate.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "lcapps, Manager at Riverview Inn, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for the kind words and honest review!!
