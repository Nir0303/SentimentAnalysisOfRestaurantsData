I feel fortunate the have the Powerhouse in Folsom. Many of my friends from other areas come out to Folsom for the shows. Drinks are fairly priced, not cheap but not ripping you off either. There is usually a decent crowd depending on the band playing. Nice location too with lots of places to eat and other bars right on Sutter Street.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-16T14:37:40-0400", "location_id": "10457314", "id": "406350968", "user": {"username": "danielarusk", "user_location": {"name": "Folsom, California", "id": "32389"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Great Entertainment and Cheap Drinks", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32389-d10457314-r380420307-m11068-Powerhouse_Pub-Folsom_California.html#review380420307", "text": "I went to the Powerhouse Pub to see Tom Rigney and his band - one of the best entertainers I've ever seen.  They were charging a $10 cover and a glass of wine was $6.50 on a Sunday afternoon.  Customers could order food from the pizza place next door by calling them on a wall phone in the lobby and it would be delivered.  The dance floor was large and there was not a bad seat in the house to be able to see the stage.  Parking down the hill behind the building is free and in the shade.  It's hard to see the front door from Sutter Street, but easy to see the sign on the back of the building from the parking lot on the corner of Greenback and Scott.  They have self-serve ice water for free.  This is a great venue!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-06-06T17:24:36-0400", "location_id": "10457314", "id": "380420307", "user": {"username": "mikaelsen", "user_location": {"name": "california", "id": null}}}]}
