The most impressive room is the atrium with the massive sculpture of Father of the Waters (Minnesota's Mississippi River). Stained glass is not a part of contemporary or suburban public buildings so seeing so much of it here in this building does indicate how proud early citizens were of their new city government. We were proud too after finishing our tour..a good civics lesson.\nSUGGESTIONS:\nParking is easy here most times of day, just drive around the block (avoiding all the police cars that seem to be ringing the block}, and enter the underground public garage. Its a bargain price, dry and safe.\nFood  or snacks....Anything edible is hard to come by here. This building really needs to develop something...like developing its great brick/stone basement into a Ratskeller-like eating place like that at the Minnesota state capital ...imagine having coffee, a bowl of chili or a sandwich in the subterranean restaurant there. That might even be a money earner for the city ! How fun for visitors too.\nBe sure to see the restored historic City Council Chambers.\nSUMMARY: A must do for visitors and citizens alike....great place to bring out-of-town relatives.
