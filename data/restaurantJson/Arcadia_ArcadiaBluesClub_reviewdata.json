Although you can dance at the club, it has become more about listening to music, which is ok, but I'm a dancer and must admit I enjoyed the club far more in it's earlier dive bar, dance incarnation.

Many of the bands who frequented Cozy's (BB Chung King and the Buddaheads, Coco Montoya, etc.) have set up shop at ABC. The have also attracted larger name players like Johnny Winter and Charlie Musselwhite to the club. Despite this, the cover price is usually around 20 or less, even less online. The drinks are about average price for a bar/club. On my last visit, the house band played two 40 minute sets and the headliner played two hour long sets. While the headliner took a break, the house band played. This was not a bad setup because the house band, Bobby Bluehouse, played fantastic cover versions of classic songs. Of course the place is not the prettiest venue or has the best sound system but that's part of the beauty of it. The little imperfections gives it a nice atmosphere.
