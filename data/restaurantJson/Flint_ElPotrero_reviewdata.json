I don't ususally search out Mexican when we travel, so used to  what I get at home that it just isn't worth it to me.  My husband on the other hand, wants to try it every where we go! I haven't lived in the north for 40 years, but told him not to expect much. Wow...was I surprised! El Potrero easily matched some of our local Houston Tex Mex restaurants in taste and menu offerings. A far cry from what I remember available in Mi! We ordered Margaritas...a true test.  They were nicely frozen, with just the right proportions of lime and tequila. Actually liked them better than the ones at our local watering hole! The chips were good and plentiful. Many places actually charge for the chips ( never in Texas) but El Potrero did not, and kept the basket full.  The picante sauce tasted authentic, not mass produced, but it may have been. A nice blend of tomato and spices, but not overly spicey. I tried the sampler appetizer for my main course. This consisted of a Cheese Quesadia, flauta, chimichanga, guacamole, cheese dip (queso) and green salsa.This gave me an opportunity to sample the Mexican mainstay. Everything was very good, and more than enough food for two people. I could only eat one of each ( there were 2) item. The chimichanga was exceptional and the quesadia cheese was very creamy and cheesey not tough. My husband tried the Pollo Accupulco and a taco on the side. Everything was gone when he finished so I guess he enjoyed it.  We both thought the service was good, attentive to our empty glasses, and chip basket! The prices were very reasonable right at $30 for two  with Margaritas, about what we spend at home.  I have to eat my words, about Michigan and Mexican food, El Potrero has changed my mind, at least for this one resaturant.\nI'll go back and try something else, if I'm in town.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-12T07:45:48-0400", "location_id": "3529136", "id": "221351049", "user": {"username": "Sandra P", "user_location": {"name": "Houston, Texas", "id": "56003"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Great food at a great price!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42207-d3529136-r214656018-m11068-El_Potrero-Flint_Michigan.html#review214656018", "text": "My wife and I love this place!
