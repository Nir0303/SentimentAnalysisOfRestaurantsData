Instead of opening at 8am, they now open at 10am. This could lead off into an interesting discussion about raising the minimum wage for service jobs, but I won't go there. Nonetheless, us two old friends were allowed to come in and visit while they were cleaning up, and when the cook came in they put together a great omelet. A bit heavy on the oil, but fluffy eggs and a tasty home fried potatoes. Server was friendly. With largely hard walls, the music resonated throughout the interior and made quiet conversation nearly impossible. Lot's of flashy kid video machines, so I imagine this place gets crazy at times.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-23T16:06:30-0500", "location_id": "4375109", "id": "342225888", "user": {"username": "Wuerme", "user_location": {"name": "Vancouver, Washington", "id": "60820"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2014-06", "title": "Not impressed!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51893-d4375109-r218586637-m11068-Wildwood_Cafe_On_Main-Gresham_Oregon.html#review218586637", "text": "My family was very disappointed with this restaurant.
