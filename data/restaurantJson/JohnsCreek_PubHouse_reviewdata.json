It smelled like a hookah lounge as soon as we walked in, or like incense was burning. I didn't like that at all. We ordered fried oysters to start and they had lots of breading but, we're super good with the remalaude sauce! Entrees we're ok. The salmon was tastey but, the brocolli was cold. They promptly replaced it with mac n cheese witch was good. German chocolate cake togo for dessert was super good! Plus side about this place is that its open late night. I hear they also have live music sometimes. I also want to mention that during our visit, they started out playing great, classic rock! All the sudden, music volume went way, way loud. So much so to hurt your ears. This went on for almost a minute. Then silence. Then, 5 minutes later, reggae lounge time. Really weird. I will prob come back but, stick to apps and burgers.

Some places open as restaurants or bars and attract local regulars who over 50 years turn the place into a legendary hang out like Manuel's Tavern, despite its average to generally bad food. Here it seems they tried to start that way. This is a basic tavern oddly retrofitted into  a higher rent restaurant building. Not that the food is bad, its just not notable or extensive and it cant rely on legend to draw patrons. Suggestion: despite the pride our bartender showed in the food, its not as good as he and the owners and their reviewer \"friends\" think.
