On a couple of occasions, there has been a crying toddler back behind the counter, which is definietly out of place.  However, the most frustrating thing is that my phone app is loaded with Subway cards and the girl (s) at the register do not know how to use them.  They say \"well, their manager will be back tomorrow.\"  Tomorrow is too late - I need to use my app now.  Teach all employees how to use the app.  This is the day of the app - people want and expect to be able to use them.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-20T02:56:05-0400", "location_id": "4245888", "id": "365585309", "user": {"username": "texaswinesnob", "user_location": {"name": "Houston, Texas", "id": "56003"}}}]}
