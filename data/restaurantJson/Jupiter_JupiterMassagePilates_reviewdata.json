I had Monique and he had Megan.  Both were wonderful and relaxing.  A few things that set them apart from other spas: the hot stone option was included - not an extra charge (I hate feeling nickled and dimed for every option so this was a nice surprise) and they use cream from a jar not lotion - so there was no tapping of the bottle to get more lotion every few minutes which interrupts the 'zen' of it all. \nWe would definitely visit again for the same high-quality experience!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Johnny-Pilates, Owner at Jupiter Massage &amp; Pilates, responded to this review", "text": "We feel honored that we could be a part of your vacation plans!
