Timing being everything I arrived just as they were closing early due to rain around 6PM. In any other place this could have lead to disappointment. Where those on duty simply said they were closed. Not here. The employee at the door leading to the roof top (forgot your name and you were great) invited us to come in anyways and ask the servers all the same. If they had not broken everything down I may get that coveted French Dip. Thankfully they were still breaking things down and were happy to get me a beer and that French Dip. Which, by the way, is awesome. Great beef, bread, seasoning and that beer au jus! The priority was the guest and I felt it the entire time.
