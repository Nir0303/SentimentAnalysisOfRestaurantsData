I ordered the steak fajitas and they came hot and sizzling as expected. Dinner is served with rice and a choice of black or pinto beans (I prefer black) which were very tasty. The fajitas were seasoned well and there was plenty - I could have split it with my husband had he been with me. My only disappointment was the chewy steak - could hardly bite through it and took more effort to chew than expected. The server was great and handled the busy dining room attentively with a big smile. I'll definitely go back to try something else on their menu.

Their fish tacos are absolutely the best and I've found myself at home making the chipotle dipping sauce when we cook Mexican.  My husband and I have eaten many, many fish tacos here in the USA as well as in Baja and Hawaii.  Habanero's by far makes the best fish tacos bar none.  To compliment this meal, a fruit margarita is perfect.  The service is great, the staff are wonderful and they have made a point of remembering us personally even though we only get up to Medford periodically.  We always feel at home eating at this restaurant and highly recommend it to those of you out there that are Mexican food lovers like us.
