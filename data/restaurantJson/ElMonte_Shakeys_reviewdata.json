The brunch buffet is super small but well worth it for pizza lovers. Its around 12$ ,theres pizza , chicken , mojos, spaghetti, rice, salad bar and cinnamon rolls i think. What i usally do is stack a plate full of pizza and another with chicken and mojos , get some marinara from the spaghetti and ranch and use that as dipping sauce ( its really bomb) . Pitchers of beer are expensive and the micheladas are premade cans that budlight/budweiser makes. Not bad just feel cheated. Overall great for kids to play games and grown ups to watch sports.

What makes their Pizza stand out compared to other pizza places and chains is their pizza sauce.. I usually order a medium or even large thin crust with pepperoni or mushrooms with extra sauce.. That combination is by far my favorite Pizza anywhere and I've had Pizza in many countries and cities, including Italy, New York, Florida and many other places and if I have to pick on what my favorite Pizza is, it's the thin crust, extra sauce mushroom and Pepperoni Pizza at Shakey's.. Too bad that their only Florida location in Homestead has closed their doors..
