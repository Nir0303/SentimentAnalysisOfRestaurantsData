The ambiance and food are amazing. Dana, the owner, and her staff are always so welcoming. My kids love her and the place. Our favorite pizzas are the Vegetarian and Tanguito. They are delicious and boasting with flavor. We recently tried the Spinach and Gorgonzola white pizza and it was delicious as well. My husband and I also love the Tomato & Basil soup and the homemade Tiramisu. Our kids love the complimentary order of bread with olive spread. On Wednesdays, you can enjoy a bottle of wine for half-off. The house wine is excellent!
