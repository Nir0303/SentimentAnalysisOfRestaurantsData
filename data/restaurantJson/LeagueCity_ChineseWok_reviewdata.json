Picture of Al Pacino smoking a cigar over the top of a Buddha statue is odd and silly looking at the same time.  I have eaten lunch there several times and enjoy it when their family sits down for their lunch break as it lends a coziness to the atmosphere.  Lunch special prices are unbeatable for the amount of food you get.  I have tried several of their dishes and like all of them.  They have a drive thru and offer take out as well.  They go out of their way to prepare a special dish for folks with gluten allergies.
