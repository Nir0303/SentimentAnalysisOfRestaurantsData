Most dinner items - tacos, pupusas - are less than $10 and hard to consume all they give you.  And it taste good too.  I had the mixed pupusas - a bit greasy, but tasted good. We had a serving of the seafood soup [only made on weekends].  Two full crabs and ~8 good-sized shrimp and a chunk of white fish in a nice fish/tomato broth for $10.  Good eating if you dont mind the mess required to dig into it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-03T07:10:42-0400", "location_id": "2666180", "id": "388713689", "user": {"username": "Morgan2010", "user_location": {"name": "Lebanon, New Jersey", "id": "46562"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Love this place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46874-d2666180-r250184137-m11068-Restaurante_El_Mariachi-Trenton_New_Jersey.html#review250184137", "text": "We come here often and it is helpful to know a little Spanish.  Only the youngest son speaks any English and, even the customers tend to be Spanish only speakers.  The food speaks LOUDLY and CLEARLY and it is delicious.  Salsa's are fresh and outstanding with the salsa verde being the best I have ever had.  Exceptionally \"creamy\" and tends to be thick, almost like they add a little avocado.  It's hot and it's delicious.  They also have a hot and mild salsa that are very good but, the salsa verde is good enough that I buy some to take home.\n\nGuacamole is simple, fresh and delicious.  Not a lot of extraneous extra ingredients; avocado, salt, lime, some garlic....\n\nIf you want some sort of Chi-Chi's style \"combo platter\" this ain't the place and one drawback is that they really do not have appetizers.  We create our own by ordering one course at a time - otherwise, all food will arrive at once - and using a taco platter or papusa's as an appetizer.  The platters are just that, three tacos, beans, rice, salad for like $7.  So, again, we make an appetizer out of them.\n\nFavorite dishes are tacos a la lengua (tongue), al pastor (pork), carne adobada (pork in orange and spices), carne asada.  \n\nIt's BYO and if you spend more than $20 per person, you will explode....we get out far cheaper.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-20T06:30:35-0500", "location_id": "2666180", "id": "250184137", "user": {"username": "AndyRinPA", "user_location": {"name": "Yardley, Pennsylvania", "id": "54042"}}}]}
