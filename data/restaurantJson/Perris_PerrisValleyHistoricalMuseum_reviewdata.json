D St that serves as the museum historical archives. The museum is inside the old train depot, which is a unique and interesting place to house a history of the area since it existed most of that historical period. There is a history of the native Americans in the valley and about the agriculture and founders. The old pictures are interesting. There is no charge and the docent on duty was helpful. Closest parking is on D Street or you can park in the train/bus lot and walk across the tracks on 4th Street.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-10-07T20:26:57-0400", "location_id": "11651566", "id": "425997786", "user": {"username": "Kauai-Biz-Traveler", "user_location": {"name": "Riverside, California", "id": "32978"}}}]}
