The turkey was absolutely delicious with the smoked flavor being spot-on.  They top this with cheese, bacon bits, and their own white sauce - which absolutely brings the whole thing together into one perfect meal.

They had no green vegetables to serve, the wings were more \"white\" than \"smoked\" looking and the chef took it upon himself to now serve every batch of wings drizzled in \"ughhh\" Hot Sauce!!  I couldn't even eat them as they were not anything close to the original Product introduced to this area a few years ago. Sure the space is Primo!!

We continue to address certain issues and menu pricing is definately one on our \"to-do list.\" We can assure you that our cornbread never comes close to a freezer. Yes, we only grill one side of the cornbread. That is how it is supposed to be. It's a texture thing. Soft from the bottom with a little more bite on top from being browned on the griddle. Our wings, are smoked then fried and always lightly tossed in our house made wing sauce unless specially ordered. All of our meats and sides are prepared fresh daily.
