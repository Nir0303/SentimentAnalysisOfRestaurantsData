I bought a groupon for Star awhile back, and with expiration approaching, today was the day. The inside is much nicer than the outside, with comfortable counters and booths, brightened. With showpiece art by locals. The menu gave a good choice of sandwiches, on your choice of bread. Mine was the meat and provolone on white baguette, with veggies and a light vinegar dressing. My wife chose the Cuban on wheat. Both were very tasty, and several levels ahead of the sandwiches most chains put out. All the ingredients were superior, especially the breads and veggies. Soups, a cream of asparagus and an onion, were both tasty as well ( although my asparagus soup could have been warmer). Speaking of warmer, it was cold inside, as both doors were propped open on a spring day in the 50s. We still don't know why. Service was friendly, but with only one person working, things moved a little lazily. A good place for excellent fare at reasonable prices--but give yourself time.
