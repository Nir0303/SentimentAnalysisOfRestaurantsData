We were very pleased with the food & customer service! Jeremiah was our waiter & he was great! He was very attentive & friendly and made our experience enjoyable. I had the Minorcan Gumbo to start. Wasn't quite sure what to expect, but since I love Minorcan chowder, I decided to try it. It is very different from chowder. It is loaded with veggies & clams but I did not care for it. Next I had the shrimp & grits that was very tasty! My husband had the fried shrimp & said it was good. We both had the peanut butter pie for dessert! Oh my! Jeremiah told us it was homemade & boy was it good! Had a nice peanut butter taste & was very rich. Yum!
