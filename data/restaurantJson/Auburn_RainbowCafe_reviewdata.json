Their menu is utterly unsurprising but if you're looking for some old standards, they make them pretty good here.  The service is charming, the servers are just very real people who will chat with you and the conversations you hear are usually pretty amusing.  The old pictures of Auburn on the wall are awesome, I love looking at them. \n\nEvery time I've gone to the bar there has been very loud karaoke or some other live music.  The bar is small so the volume makes conversation totally impossible. There are usually extremely drunk patrons there, but they've been well behaved.
