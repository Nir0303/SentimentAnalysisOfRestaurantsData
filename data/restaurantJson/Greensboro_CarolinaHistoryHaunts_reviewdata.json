Tropical Storm Hermine had decided that she was going to add a little ambiance to our tour. \n\nOur tour guide for the evening was none other than Dan Riedel, co-owner of the touring company and Emerywood resident. He and his wife, Bridgette own the touring company and have recently dedicated their time to making this company very successful! There are other tour guides, of course, in the two cities they currently tour: Greensboro and Charlotte. We had the pleasure of walking through downtown with Dan. We began our tour through the shadowy streets of Greensboro at the Municipal Building on Washington Street. Dressed in period attire, he asked the tour who believed in ghosts. Almost every hand went up. He said his goal for the evening was to not only share with us the ghost stories that were part of Greensboro but also the history behind them and the area of downtown. Dan said his tours differed from some ghost tours as they don't hire actors to jump out and scare you, although he did say it was downtown Greensboro and you never know what will happen. I won't share all of the stories here as I wouldn't be able to tell them with the excitement and passion that he does. As someone who moved to North Carolina some years ago, I never truly knew the history of the area. It was nice to hear about various areas of Greensboro and how that history affects what we see and hear today. We walked through darkened alleys to hear stories of bones within walls. That story was only interrupted a few moments by a female operatic singer from a local bar. Yes, it was one of those nights in downtown. You stand near the train tracks in downtown as you are told about Hamburger Square in Greensboro. The history of the city during the Civil War. The tornado that hit downtown, yes a tornado hit downtown Greensboro. You walk past brothels and hear tales of the patrons. Greensboro once had a red light district that would have probably rivaled those in Amsterdam. You walk through and over former graveyards which are now sidewalks and parking lots. All under the watchful eyes of the keepers. (Alley cats making sure you behave). Strolling past the Carolina Theatre you can only imagine what the ghosts there must think of all the attention to them. Our tour ended at the Biltmore Hotel, well, the alley behind the Biltmore. We were told of Lydia and Phillip. Two ghosts, which inhabit the Biltmore and if I might guess, probably the two most had heard of from the area. Respect those that have passed. \n\nThe tour offers so much more than just scary stories, entertainment or a way to pass the time. It offers up history of the city of Greensboro.
