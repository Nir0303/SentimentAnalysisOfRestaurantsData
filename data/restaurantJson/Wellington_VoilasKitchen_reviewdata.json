Which I love! \n\nSides and paninis are also varied, sides being typical Venezuelan empanadas, teque\u00f1os (fried pastries to die for), baked brie and cheese platters. So one can come every day and have different options! \n\nThey also have a soup of the day, freshly prepared and today was a thai spicy soup \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about this amazing jewel, it's just fresh and homey. Plus a zillion options for teas and snoothies! And the staff is sooooooo super nice!\n\nEnough said, can't wait to come back soon!\n\nFYI salad size is BIG so share!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-09-14T09:16:02-0400", "location_id": "10745333", "id": "418506233", "user": {"username": "Trioletos", "user_location": {"name": "Wellington, Florida", "id": "34727"}}}]}
