Not sure how long this Main St location has been in operation. The pizza is still a rectangle. The crust is almost too thick and the sauce was skimpy and not flavorful.

The veggies, cucumber, carrots and tomato were quite watery. Not very appetizing.  There also wasn't enough dressing. The small cup of ranch was only enough for about half the salad. I didn't eat much of it as I had to pick my way through the brown lettuce and limp veggies.  I did get a knife and fork and eat about half of the Gutbuster.

He arrived from out of state on Monday 12/21/2015, and on Tuesday, he ordered a stuffed gut-buster pie with no onions, went to pick it up and they had made it a thin crust, he told them no that was not what he had ordered, and they told him it would be another 45 minutes to make the stuffed gut-buster with no onions. So he ran a couple errands  and picked up the pie and came back home, the pie was  as he remembered it, full to the top of the pan, no cardboard under the pie, golden crust, we cut it after the more than hour an and a half of waiting in anticipation, and  IT WAS FILLED WITH ONIONS ! I had to pick through the piece I had because of the onions. \nThe taste was reminiscent of what our son remembered from when he last had Garcia's gut-buster, and one piece filled each of us up. So when our daughter arrived, also from out of state, our son told her that after he finally got his stuffed gut-buster, it was pretty much as he remembered, she and him decided that it would be great get 2 of them for lunch on Saturday 12/26/2015 to feed all of us before they both returned to the states they now live in. \nSo our son called it in, and when they got there to pick the pies up, there was a sign stating \"NO CASH CREDIT CARDS ONLY\" (good thing our daughter was with our son, because he doesn't have a credit card and was going to pay cash for the pies) They got home with the pies, and when we opened the boxes, we were amazed, the pies didn't even fill half the depth of the pans, and this was with a round of cardboard under each pie (but they were unlike the filled to the brim pie we had gotten on Tuesday of the same week), The dough didn't look or taste fully cooked, and each of us had 2 pieces unlike Tuesdsay (where one piece filled us, and we had leftovers). He called and talked to the manager and he had to call back, because the manager didn't return his call, and the manager said he would credit the card for one pizza, so our daughter had to go back as she was heading out of town and back to her home state.  \nI can't believe the inconsistency of the pies in the same week, and the errors that were made, also can't believe they weren't able to accept cash on Saturday, but I also must say that our son experienced a clear problem with someone not able to make change on Tuesday. The bill was $26.07 he gave her $27.00 (a $20., a $5. and 2 $1.'s then said \"wait, I have the $.07\", well what he had in change was $.12 so he gave her that and told her to give him back one of the $1. bills and his change, she couldn't understand that she needed to return a dollar bill and give him a nickel in change. She told him that she had never seen anyone make change like that, and she was sure that she should be keeping both dollar bills he had originally given her.  \nIf Garcia's Pizza hopes to prosper in this town (where there is an abundance of pizza joints), they better address the problems of the poor service, not having cash on hand, not being able to count change, and inconsistency of pies.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-12-26T10:25:27-0500", "location_id": "9607451", "id": "335082374", "user": {"username": "Ruth D", "user_location": {"name": "Bloomington", "id": null}}}]}
