We took your concerns to heart and have placed more staff later in the evening to make sure that the level of service during the day is the same as late night. No one should have a sub par experience just because it is later in the evening. If you could contact me at jesse@matadorrestaurants.com, I would love to take care of your next meal to show you how things here should be.\n\nThank you,\nJesse Duncan", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2016-07-21T17:56:40-0400", "id": "395290082"}, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-26T11:21:42-0400", "location_id": "911225", "id": "386172769", "user": {"username": "p p", "user_location": {"name": "London, United Kingdom", "id": "186338"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Delicious luncheon spot!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58702-d911225-r384647155-m11068-The_Matador-Redmond_Washington.html#review384647155", "text": "We grabbed lunch here, it was crowded, but we could sit at the bar.
