Stopped by and had a very knowledgable gentleman show us around. Learned all kind of things about the city and county I didnt know. He was a wealth of information and the displays were interesting. The building was formally the Tyler Library. He even let us go upstairs to the performance hall. It was designed by the architect that designed Carnegie Hall and Library. The acoustics were like no other little theater I've ever entered. Glad I went.

They have an interesting collection of historical items, photos, etc. spanning mainly the history of Smith County and Tyler from the Civil War to the 1970's.  The room with the displays from the 20th century features a mural on the wall which was a WPA art project in the 1930's.  Upstairs is a large room with a stage for meetings.  The staff is friendly and helpful and can answer many questions one may have about the history of the area.  They also have back issures of the society's magazine for sale.  They are normally $15 a copy but they told me many were on sale for just $5 each.  I bought two issues from the 1980's which featured interesting articles about Camp Ford, the Confederate Civil War Prison on the northeast side of Tyler, and the Cotton Belt RR, which had its origins in Tyler.  The staff was very helpful to go through their index to find the articles of interest to me.  I was favorably impressed by the items on display, the information provided, and the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-22T09:40:10-0500", "location_id": "8430770", "id": "328418688", "user": {"username": "TallTexWally", "user_location": {"name": "Texarkana, Texas", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Wonderful Museum about Smith County, Texas!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56797-d8430770-r328081364-m11068-Smith_County_Historical_Society_Museum-Tyler_Texas.html#review328081364", "text": "I loved visiting The Smith County Historical Society Museum because it celebrates the contributions of all of their citizens from the days of the Cherokee native Americans led by Chief Bowles, to the early Settlers, up to the present day.\n\nWe were fortunate to be given a tour by John Anderson who is the Smith County's Historical Society Museum Interim Director.
