You might want to check Google Maps' street view beforehand to get a handle on what to look for if its your first time. \n\nI had an early lunch featuring a delicious roast turkey, melted provolone and cranberry sauce sandwich on grilled pannini with a side of mustard potato salad, washed down with iced tea, all in trendy \"boutique\" style, opposite of the usual fast food fare.  If you are still hungry, you won't be able to resist their ice cream selection to top off your meal.  Be sure to tip the hard-working ladies; they deserve it.  If the weather is suitable, sit outside and enjoy the ambience of Old Orange's typically Californian town square, which in this \"square peg-round hole\" case is probably the oldest traffic circle in the State.
