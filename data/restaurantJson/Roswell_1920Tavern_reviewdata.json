Hamburger: dry, with waaayyyyy more bun than meat. French fries were the ONLY thing salted all night. Server said it was a slow night, so attention to detail should have been on point.

My son had the prosciutto wrapped Chilian seabass, that although was delicious, was not worth $32 (very small piece) and the manager knew because he had 2 orher complaints about portion size. In the end, we got a free dessert.

Because we decided to go out last minute we decided to try 1920 Tavern as you could make reservations.  The hostesses were fantastic and the bar was hopping when we arrived.  I tried their cucumber melon cocktail which was very refreshing on that hot night.  My husband loved the house margarita.  Our server was wonderful and made great suggestions on what to try.  I never went to Inc. so the menu was all new to us.  We shared calamari, oysters and Kobe meatballs- all very tasty.  They have a great variety of small plates although the one item our friends ordered was not available.  Try the tacos!!!!! We had the tuna, steak and shrimp and they were very tasty.  You could easily eat those as an entree.  They are known for their shrimp and grits which we had no room for this visit.  The only issue that night was the air went out temporarily but was was quickly fixed.  Great cocktail choices and choices of beer on tap.  The bar was crowded on our way out and we heard other groups having as much fun as we were.  Thank you for the delicious drinks and dinner.
