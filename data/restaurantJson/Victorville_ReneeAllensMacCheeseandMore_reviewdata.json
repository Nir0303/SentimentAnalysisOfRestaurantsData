All my doctors and the laboratory are in Apple Valley and I'd stop in Renee Allen's Mac & Cheese to buy a meal for my lunch.   Sometimes, I'd even specifically drive to Apple Valley to buy my lunch at Renee Allen's.  However, eventually the delicious collard greens were no longer delicious.  They were under-cooked and not properly seasoned.  The mac & cheese also lost its quality.  It was no longer creamy and rich and a little on the watery side.  I stopped going there for a while.  When I finally went back just before the business moved to Victorville, I felt that, overall, the food was no longer the quality it was when the take-out opened its business.  One of my friends stopped at the new location and she said the food was terrible.  I'm searching for another great soul food restaurant.  I don't recommend this place.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-09-16T08:21:57-0400", "location_id": "8028131", "id": "419181802", "user": {"username": "Arlene R", "user_location": {"name": "Victorville, California", "id": "33224"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Terrible", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33224-d8028131-r373865665-m11068-Renee_Allen_s_Mac_Cheese_and_More-Victorville_California.html#review373865665", "text": "So I tried this place this week because I had heard nothing but good things from people about it. Unfortunately, it was terrible.  Soul food is my favorite type of food, so I could not have been more disappointed.  I ordered the Fried Red Snapper. The meat was dry and it tasted like they forgot to add seasoning. My side was Mac n' Cheese, which was horrible. Tasted like someone dumped nothing but black pepper into it. I also had greens. The greens were actually pretty amazing and the best part of the meal. I also had cornbread, which also lacked flavor. My husband had Fried Chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly, however it also tasted like they had forgot to season it.  He ordered pinto beans, which had been overcooked and looked more like refried beans. The meal for 2 of us was $30. This was a big waste of money due to the poor quality of the food.  I would not ever go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-17T14:47:46-0400", "location_id": "8028131", "id": "373865665", "user": {"username": "Ami T", "user_location": {"name": "Victorville, California", "id": "33224"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "dining", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33224-d8028131-r337639413-m11068-Renee_Allen_s_Mac_Cheese_and_More-Victorville_California.html#review337639413", "text": "I wanted to try this place, i had heard such good things about it.
