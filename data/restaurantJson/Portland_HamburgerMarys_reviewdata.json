Very casual atmosphere. Diverse crowd of gay, straight people. Everyone was having a good time! The Mac and Cheese Balls are very good, American style comfort food. You can build your own yummy burger with a variety of meat or veggie patties to choose from and with all the fixins, or order one of their specialty burgers. It was alot of fun and very different.
