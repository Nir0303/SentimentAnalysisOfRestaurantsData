Le Boulanger bakes their own bread, and that is the reason to go there as the bread makes the simple sandwich wonderful.  Meats, cheeses and fillings are all fresh.  They make some great soups that rotate daily, and offer a bread bowl which is especially good with clam chowder or Le Bou's Cream of Chicken. Every product is high quality; sandwiches are made to order exactly to your specification. Who knew a sandwich could be so exciting. \n\nBack to that great bread: you can choose which type of bread that you want on your sandwich. You can buy loaves of bread: Sweet French, Dutch  Crunch (a fan favorite in loaf or sliced bread), Sourdough and some Wheat/Healthy types. There is a nice kids menu, with small sandwiches and a cookie.  For breakfast, there are all sorts of great Danish's, cinnamon rolls, bagels ,and coffee cakes.   A perfect dinner roll is made in white or wheat flour that is wonderful at Thanksgiving but just great to eat with dinner everyday.\n\nThe only downside in coming to the bakery is that it is hard to park when going  to Le Boulanger Cupertino.  Since the bakery is on the ground floor of an office/condo plaza, you have to turn into the parking garage which is directly behind the bakery, off Stevens Creek Blvd.  Once you park there for the first time, you will have no problem parking there the next time.  Once you eat the sandwiches, you will be a fan of Le Boulanger and will not care about the parking!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-06-17T18:56:09-0400", "location_id": "916256", "id": "210857343", "user": {"username": "Antoinella", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-07", "title": "Good bakery and sandwitch place...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32273-d916256-r201355495-m11068-LeBoulanger-Cupertino_California.html#review201355495", "text": "If you really like bakery items, you need to visit this place.
