One can choose from either beef or Polish. Condiments are added to the customer's specifications. However, my advice is to try the special sauce as it is absolutely fantastic! The hotdog, chips, and drink combo cost only seven dollars\u2026 A real bargain!! In addition, the service is incredibly fast. From the time that I queued up until I received my food was approximately two minutes, and this was even at noon time.
