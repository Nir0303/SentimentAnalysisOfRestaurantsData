Our waiter was awesome and was very nice and attending as well as gave us advice and suggestions when ordering food and drinks. The food was ABSOLUTELY amazing and takes the visitor to the Mediterranean area in no time.\nDefinitely my new favorite place in the valley. We will be back!

The group as a whole thought the food was very good. I thought it was so-so. Fi9rst, about me. Lived in Long Island 47 years, then in Utah, so I've had great food and very average food.  I'm a serious home cook and I like bold flavors.  I ordered an appetizer of ham cappicola and provolone wrapped in eggplant, battered and deep fried.  I thought it was bland, a the marinara sauce served with it did nothing to elevate it.  For dinner I had the gyro to judge against gyros I've had in other places.  The portion size was very nice and the sauce flavor was pretty good.  But the meat was more in taste and texture like a beef patty from Burger King than nicely spiced slices of gyro meat.  I've had better in Ogden, Utah, hardly the Greek food capital of the world. My other complaint was the wine list- I thought a place with a mid-priced food menu should have some house wines in the $5-6 dollar a glass range- the wines by the glass were mostly $8-10. Maybe I just didn't make the best menu choices, because everyone else was pretty happy, so I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 3.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-27T20:50:22-0400", "location_id": "450050", "id": "368331291", "user": {"username": "Lijemtu", "user_location": {"name": "San Tan Valley, Arizona", "id": "2481823"}}}]}
