Because that is where the fire department used to be, so they have these extra large garage doors that are always raised and that is what gives the link from the inside to the outside of this place such a uniqueness. The tables are on the massive firetruck driveway with extra bench seating around the perimeter. The ladies room is the original location of the restroom for the firefighters and they have added the men's room. The bar area is the old apparatus room. \nIt's next to the river, near the High Street Bridge that leads to Main Street on the west Side and just across the street from the Hotel. \nGreat place to have a beer. I do wonder what they are going to do this winter, when so much of their seating is outside. (dog gone).
