You grab you plate and start opening the glass cases to get your pick of great pastries.  About 50% are Mexican pastries... Which I love.  They tend to be denser and drier.   Hard to describe... But they taste great.  I also love their flan. Muy delicious!!!\n\nWe always set outside when we eat there.  Nicely landscaped porch area that is very quiet and relaxing.  Table are bare bones.  \n\nThe ladies who work there are always nice and helpful.\n\nThis is not a fancy place.  It is just a nice, clean little hole in the wall place that has great Mexican pastry.   Give it a try!\n\n", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-07-21T19:22:33-0400", "location_id": "4810187", "id": "291296830", "user": {"username": "texasfla", "user_location": {"name": "lakeland, fl", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-02", "title": "Love Ana's Mexican Bakery", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60737-d4810187-r260415062-m11068-Ana_s_Mexican_Bakery-Beaumont_Texas.html#review260415062", "text": "The selection is is awesome,so many things to choose from and ALL delicious!

This is not a donut shop with goopy sugar glazed items. These are the traditional, freshly baked sweets that have sprinkled large grain sugars, fresh cinnamon, crisp cookies, great bread selections, again the word traditional. The coffee is fresh and seating available. Parking is fine and the back entrance takes you though an outside dining area and past the bakery. You are surrounded by bins of assorted breads and cookies with sets of tongs and bags to select goodies. The coffee is dark and strong. Usually there is only one person available to help you with your selections and she also serves the coffee and tallies the bill. The baker brings in trays of fresh items and she assists in their placement. It is family run and not your usual coffee shop in and out. A great place to shop, buy items and enjoy them over coffee before taking the rest home for later. Good spot to buy for the office for these are neat items not usually found even in traditional supermarket bakeries. If you have visited Mexico and shopped at a bakery, you will be right at home. If you want to visit Mexico and shop at a bakery, you can do it right here, right now.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-18T08:24:24-0400", "location_id": "4810187", "id": "260342689", "user": {"username": "Celestialtraveler24", "user_location": {"name": "Beaumont, Texas", "id": "60737"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-03", "title": "food okay, service not so good.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60737-d4810187-r259840362-m11068-Ana_s_Mexican_Bakery-Beaumont_Texas.html#review259840362", "text": "The aroma from this bakery hit me as soon as I opened my car door and it was wonderful. When I went into the bakery, I was pleased to see it is mostly a serve yourself type bakery.  You get a large tray and tongs then open glass doors and help yourself to the items you'd like to purchase. I am not completely familiar with Mexican cookies/pastries so I got what looked good and went to check out.  The young lady at the register was on the phone.  She was speaking Spanish so I could only recognize a few words but combined with the few words I knew and the laughter, I could tell it was a personal conversation. I attempted to ask the name of a couple of the pastries that I was buying..Many pastries were plainly marked on the shelves, others were not. She really was not interested in helping me. She stuffed all the items I'd purchased in to one small bag and handed it to me. I paid(almost $10.00 worth) and left. The cookies were a little dry, the churros were good, along with the other items that I purchased. It's a small bakery but there were 2 couples in the restaurant drinking coffee and eating. I hope they got better service than I.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-03-16T13:51:27-0400", "location_id": "4810187", "id": "259840362", "user": {"username": "LionPSC", "user_location": {"name": "Orange, Texas", "id": null}}}]}
