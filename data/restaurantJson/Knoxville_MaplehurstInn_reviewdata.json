We stayed in the penthouse which is a gorgeous room with a spa tub. We didn't use the tub because it was filthy and I didn't want to clean while on vacation. The tiny shower in the room was full of what looked like bottles of shampoo purchased at the dollar store or left behind by other guests. To top it off the sink was missing a nozzle for the hot water and the shower nozzle was labelled incorrectly and I almost scalded myself. \n\nOur breakfast involved a trip down a rickety spiral staircase into a poorly lit and musty smelling dungeon. I asked Sonny if there was another means of getting to the kitchen as my boyfriend has a disability. He condescendingly told me old ladies could manage them but if we really wanted to we could walk down the driveway and enter through the back door of the kitchen. Breakfast included badly cooked eggs, generic yogurt, toast and an assortment of jelly jars that all looked as though they'd seen better, fresher days. The worse part of breakfast was the long, unwanted conversation with Sonny regarding the benefits of colloidal silver. (not making this up, he makes it and drinks it which he proved to us by spraying some in his mouth out of a filthy spray bottle...wth?) The snacks left out were off brand pre-packaged cookies and a bowl of rotting fruit. Maybe it was too dark down in the kitchen for him to see what he was putting out for his guests. We went out for breakfast our second day. Sonny did tell us he had friends at a local brewery so there were complimentary growlers in the kitchen and we could help ourselves. I went to the kitchen our second night to get some of the beer and was so disgusted by the mess in the refrigerator that I passed on the beer. \n\nWhen it was time to settle up Sonny asked for a higher payment amount than what had been quoted to us. Sadly we would not go back or recommend to other travelers which is a shame because this location has lots of potential.

My husband and I stayed here on one of his work trips and Sonny really took care of us. I am sorry it took me a while to comment,  but I have. Never forgotten the amazing treatment and stay. You could stay somewhere newer, but no place as pretty and being treated like family.

We arrived somewhere between 2:00-2:30, but apparently we were not supposed to arrive until 3:00 or later.  My husband called a # noted on the door.  He was told we were to have notified the host ahead of time if we were coming early.  We apologized, but since we were driving in from another state, we hadn't known what time we'd arrive.  Our host, Sonny, arrived within a half-hour and showed us to our room which was a lovely large room with our requested king bed.  We later called and requested some drinking glasses and asked if the non-working floor lamp could be replaced.  We had also noticed an electric cord running from beside the bed and across the room to the TV.  We noted that the cord was dangerous, but Sonny said if we wanted TV, that was the cord.  We did request a towel over the cord, so we wouldn't trip.  When we left for dinner, I asked where we should park if his parking area was full.  He said, \"Well, you took up 2 parking spaces when you parked.\"  (There were no marked spaces.)  To compound our stay, the bathroom had been patched and spot painted in several different colors, the towel bar fell off the wall, and the hardware from the missing toilet paper holder was still attached to the wall.  Breakfast, which was very nice, was spent with our host asking us about a mineral silver and why it was wonderful and then asking us if we invested in stocks and promoting some of his own investments.  The bed was never made up nor towels picked up.  However, Sonny mentioned that he hoped we would write a review for Trip Advisor and so we have.", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-09-02T18:03:24-0400", "location_id": "2374054", "id": "226520680", "user": {"username": "barbara89", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Southern hospitality at its finest!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55138-d2374054-r225705554-m11068-Maplehurst_Inn-Knoxville_Tennessee.html#review225705554", "text": "We have stayed at many places in Knoxville and we lived in Knoxville for 6 years.

There are a lot of chain low end hotels in Knoxville and I was hoping to find something with a little character. The Maplehurst Inn was great. If you are a person who can appreciate old one of a kind furniture and things from another era, the decor is perfect for you. Way more interesting than some Holiday Inn. There was a parlor to sit in downstairs, an excellent breakfast, and a great location just a few blocks from Market Square and right next to the river. It was very clean, the room was spotless--the furniture was old but all was well maintained. My mom loved it, the place has a style and you won't forget it the way one forgets these cookie cutter hotels. The proprietor even gave me a lift to the UTK a few blocks away. Very nice, I'd highly recommend. Our room came out to $88, but I'd have gladly paid a bit more than that.
