It's never been my top choice but not somewhere I dislike going. The breakfast to me just seems to be lacking something. However, let me tell you that I just went for a business lunch and boy was I blown away. I got the Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich with the soup of the day which was broccoli cheddar. I don't like broccoli, like at all. So when the soup came I was not looking forward to trying it. I sampled a colleague's strawberry spinach salad first and it was mind blowing. It is a combination of fresh strawberries, spinach leaves, big blue cheese crumbles and thinly sliced almonds. The dressing is a raspberry vinaigrette and somehow all of those flavors just explode in your mouth. If you like salads, I would highly recommend it. \n\nMy sandwhich was good but the stand outs were definitely the broccoli cheddar soup and that strawberry spinach salad. Both, gold medal worthy. \n\nThe place gets a tad busy and it's not unusual during peak times to have a line backed up against the door.
