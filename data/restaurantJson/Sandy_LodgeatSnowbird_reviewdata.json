It has a nice retro feel to it, and one gets the impression as if one had just stepped into a time machine. The location is undoubtedly very good, and this is what the people running this place cash in.\n\nHaving said this, I have not paid a fifth of this. This is why I am not very amused. Besides, when the first payment bounced (for reasons unknown to me), I was not told to fix the problem once I am there: No, the booking was canceled with minutes.  \n\nRecently, I was joking in a review on Tripadvisor that offering no wireless internet access as part of a hotel room is like offering no bed. This was obviously a joke, making the point that I consider this an integral element of any accommodation. This comment is put onto a new level by this room, that actually does not have a bed. All that is offered is a sofa one can sleep on. \n\nNote that I paid a four digit amount in dollars for three nights. In many places, one can stay for a month for this amount.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-01-07T09:26:09-0500", "location_id": "110297", "id": "338239308", "user": {"username": "Karlkoreander", "user_location": {"name": "Berlin", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Quiet and Relaxing", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57128-d110297-r314522749-m11068-Lodge_at_Snowbird-Snowbird_Utah.html#review314522749", "text": "We stayed at the Lodge in a studio suite during Oktoberfest.
