This is a small restaurant and the staff was very attentive. The guacamole was fresh and I enjoyed every bite. My mini tacos were good as well. I had 5 mini tacos - 3 steak and 2 chicken. The steak fajitas were well seasoned and tender - a good blend of vegetables. If we are every in the Waco area again we will go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-25T07:31:30-0400", "location_id": "4652837", "id": "303274275", "user": {"username": "Ajourne", "user_location": {"name": "Gulf Shores, Alabama", "id": "30582"}}}]}
