I did send you a message on groupon about the onions weren't old, we cut them fresh every morning and put them in a container in fridge. Also, I am not sure why the bun wasn't heated up I will definitely let my staff know about that mistake. I would like you to come back and have 2 free wieners on us and let us know your name and ask for the manager on duty when you come in.

I., and can't remember ever going in here.  Maybe I did, just can't remember.  Now I come 9000 miles to visit a neighborhood restaurant.  Was at a bank nearby and needed breakfast, and City Hall Diner is stearing me in the face, so in we popped.  This is what I call an old fashioned diner.  Long counter and stools on the right, 4-6 tables on the left, and short order cook flippin' my pancakes and rolling my omelette.  Fantastic feeling, diner waitress taking the order and serving the food.  Its like home.  People who did not grow up with diners will just not know the feeling.  Great food, service and atmosphere.  It is a tiny place right on Park Avenue, near the corner with Rolf Street, and a stones throw from Cranston City Hall.  Very reasonable prices, restrooms in back.   And I run into an old friend also.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-20T01:47:57-0400", "location_id": "10598468", "id": "394580266", "user": {"username": "bob2bkk", "user_location": {"name": "Bangkok, Thailand", "id": "293916"}}}]}
