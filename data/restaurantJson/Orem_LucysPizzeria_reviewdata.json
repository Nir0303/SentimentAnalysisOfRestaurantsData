After all, we had a slightly unruly toddler who skipped her nap with us.

Definitely not fast food, but good food rarely is, and it wasn't overly long. \n\nOur pizza was fabulous, as always, and reasonably priced. The Meaty is my favorite, with quality sausage being paramount. We also love the BBQ Chicken, though we add bacon.

I moved out west from NY and have been on a quest for NY pizza for the last 30 years.  I finally came upon it a couple of years ago.

You will read other reviews about how poor the service is.  I was one that left a poor review on Facebook one day.  The service was NOTORIOUSLY horrible, but I noticed a significant effort to up their dining game.\n\nTo-Go is probably still your best bet if you are in a hurry.  The restaurant would benefit greatly if they would just give up the full-service and just let your order at the counter and take your food back to a table.\n\nTuesdays is $1.50 slice day and every other day they have a 2 slice and soda special for $6.  Salads are great, appetizers (except for the fried mozzarella brick) are good.  Desserts are OK... They sound great on the menu, but we've never had a winning dessert.\n\nPizza selection is outstanding, you can't go wrong with any selection.
