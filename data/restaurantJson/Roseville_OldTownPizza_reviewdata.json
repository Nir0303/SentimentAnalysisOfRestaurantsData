Our neighbor and I have been having conversations and exchanging reviews of pizza places that we have ate at in the past. She told me about Old Town Pizza and asked if I had ever had their pizza. She also mentioned that a new location was opening up in Roseville. We made a date for both of our families to have dinner one Friday evening back in the summer, and this has become a traditional Friday night dinner location for my family. I can't express how delicious they are pizza it is. The crest, the sauce, the toppings are absolutely mouthwatering and keeps you coming back for more.
