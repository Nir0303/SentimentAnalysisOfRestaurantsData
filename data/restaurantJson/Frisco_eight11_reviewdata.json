A very rustic location off the main street of older Frisco.  The restaurant is a renovated house with the charm of an inn type restaurant with tables and chairs scattered about to take advantage of the meager seating.  We went on a Thursday and happened upon a table which I imagine is hard to find during busy times.  They advertise themselves as a wine bar and have a modest list of wines with a daily flight choice (very nice set of wines) for a reasonable cost.  Five glasses of 2 oz wines for $25.  We paired our wines with a cheese platter and personal pizza which turned out to be perfect for our occasion.  The service was sporadically attentive and casual.  There were many tables of people having a good time and singing with the live guitarist/musician who by the way was extremely talented and touched upon a set of very popular ballads enjoyed by I believe everyone at the restaurant.  The restaurant is decorated very sparsely but eclectic with some interesting details in the silverware and plates.  The noise level was very high making it somewhat difficult to carry on an intimate conversation.  If you are looking for something off the beaten path and away from the usual night out, I think that this may fit your bill.  I do like the energy of the people and place.
