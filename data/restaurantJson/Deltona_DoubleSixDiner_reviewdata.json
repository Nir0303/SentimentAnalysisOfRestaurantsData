I'm not too familiar with this cuisine so I decided on ordering a Cuban sandwich. It's definitely different than most Cubans with what I believe is shredded roast pork. It's very tasty and filling as I only ate about 3/4th's of it. Also on Trip Advisor a lot of people were raving about their icee's saying how good they were and I must say they are completely right. I tried their strawberry- lemonade and I was close to trying another one because they're so good but I was too full.
