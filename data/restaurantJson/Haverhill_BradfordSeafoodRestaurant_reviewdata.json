I could almost hear the waves crash and the seagulls circling. There were standards for the kids. Also, there is a Greek influence in the recipes such as the Greek vegetables, perfectly seasoned and boiled. The fresh homemade bread \"like Mama makes\" was a nice break away from the run of the mill restaurants out there. My husband had crab stuffed haddock, myself the almond crusted type. Yum! This is a great place on the way to NH so make it part of your itinerary.
