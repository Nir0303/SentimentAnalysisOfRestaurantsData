I stayed at Hotel Indigo for two nights. The first night was a pleasant experience. The second night not so much. I arrived in the room to find the A.C. making a loud screeching sound. It was late in the evening. I called down to customer service and was told that they were unable to accommodate me in a comparable room as they were sold out. However, they offered to have the maint. worker take a look at it. After a significant amount of time, the maint. worker came up to the room (with a strong odor of alcohol) and a not so pleasant demeanor and said he wasn't able to help as it would take hours to replace the A.C. Thereafter, I was moved to another room with a roll a way bed. Unfortunately, this room was also experiencing A.C. issues. However, due to our level of exhaustion and the time of night, we decided to stick it out. I felt it was very important to discuss this matter with management further. I called Sunday morning, after checking out, and I quickly realized what a \"treat\" I was in for. Ms. O was very abrupt and did not listen or validate my concerns regarding my 2nd night at the Indigo Hotel. In fact, she became argumentative and manipulated the conversation. Further, she advised that she was \"the end of the rainbow\" and that I was unable to deal with anyone else regarding my concerns. Being that I paid a decent rate for what I believed to be a high quality hotel, I am extremely dissatisfied with no recourse at all. In fact, I think had she been understanding or simply listened to my frustrations, I would have been accepting of the situation. That was not the case at all. I think it's important to make others aware of my experience and the fact that I will not refer another person to the Indigo Hotel.

Check in went very well and the staff was nice and pleasant and gave us directions to various places to eat. The room was large and had windows on two sides so there was plenty of light. We were on the second floor but the view consisted of the building next door and a rooftop. Maybe upper floors are better as far as a view. I was surprised that there was no refrigerator in the room. Also I was surprised that there was no bottled water in the room as has become standard practice in most all hotels nowadays. There was a coffee maker. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and we probably had the best nights sleep that we had in the last ten days. The air-conditioner was not overly noisy and the room was very quiet. The bath was nice and had a nice large shower. The hotel and room were clean and appeared well maintained tho the carpet in the hallway was showing some wear. The hotel is right at the River District which offers lots of things to do as well as restaurants. There is a bar at the hotel on the ground floor and another on the roof.

To those who do not know its location, it is located in the downtown area of Ft Myers.  The building was the former post office.  The Location is in the middle of the vibrant night district that is full of bars and food places next to the river.  An excellent location if you enjoy such life, or any life.  The property it self was good to very good, clean and no sign of issues.  They have slow elevators but they appear to be the original ones from the old postal days.  A very modern lobby and very friendly and helpful staff greats one where.  I had the impression they were selected to have a good attitude for the guest.  In todays hosting market, that is important.  There are two bars on the site.  One is in the lobby and the other is on the roof with an exercise center and a pool.  Both bars are smallish but full service.  There was no restaurant on property but several venders were about.  Closes was an Ichiban and a caf\u00e9 called Standard.  Both are in the old postal lobby and feet away.  There was also a Starbucks close and a place that looked good for a burger if desired.  The within a few blocks was that vibrant down town area of Ft Myers.  They have on site valet parking but many prefer to use the public garage across the street.  I noticed even the parking staff were very helpful with any need.  I fell that what makes this property apart from many was the attitude and helpfulness of the staff.  One feels good staying here.

This is a first for me - and unfortunately it's not a good one!  I was happy to find this hotel for our recent travel to Ft. Myers.  My husband and I have to travel to Ft. Myers 4+ times in the coming months.   I love the hotel's location, so I was planning to stay there again.    The hotel was ok - definitely not up to other \"boutique\" hotel stays I had had in the past, but it was good enough.   A few minor issues, but nothing that we couldn't live with.  Until.... \n\nI made the mistake of leaving 4 hanging clothing items behind when we checked out.  While still in the car on the long ride home, I realized my error and my husband called the hotel.  My items could not be located in lost and found.  He was told that they would talk to the housekeeping manager the next morning and call us back.   No return call the next morning, so I called after lunch.  The front desk person I spoke to hadn't heard about my missing items so she looked in lost and found again and also checked the room.  They hadn't rented the room since we left, so I was hopeful they were overlooked when the room was cleaned - apparently not.    Her reply to me was \"I'm not sure what you could have done with your items, but they weren't left here\".  Huh????  Just because you DID NOT FIND my items in the room, doesn't mean they WEREN'T LEFT behind!  The lady was rudely \"polite\", but never once apologized, or seemed to care much about my missing items.   When I pressed her further, she reluctantly agreed to contact the housekeeping manager on her cell phone.  After contacting the housekeeping manager, she called me back and once again informed me that \"my items were NOT left behind\".  Argh... so frustrating... I don't have my clothes and I DID leave them there, so please stop telling me that I didn't!\n\nShe didn't seem to care much about my situation so I asked to speak to a manager.   Her reply was - \"I am the manager\".   Oh, great!  After I inquired further about speaking to someone above her, she reluctantly transferred me to the \"office manager\".  This lady was definitely much better than the first person I spoke to.  She actually apologized for \"not being able to locate\" my items and didn't make me feel as though I had done something wrong.....  Bottom line:  I don't expect to ever see my clothes again, but it was nice to at least hear that \"they will continue to look into it and will contact me if my items turn up in the future\".   Definitely won't be going back to Hotel Indigo Ft.
