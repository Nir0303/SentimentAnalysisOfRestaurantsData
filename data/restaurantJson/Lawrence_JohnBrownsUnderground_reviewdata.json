The bierock was fantastic, tasted like thanksgiving in a delicious, golden pastry.  The sliders were good, too.  It was a totally dead night so we got to chat with the bartender about the space.  I can't remember her name (we'd been to a few places by then \ud83d\ude09) but she took us on a tour of the rest of the property which included a great space upstairs with huge windows overlooking the street.  would make a great restaurant....

If it's not busy, head right on in.  \n\nWe have only had to wait once, and it was during the holiday season.  Any other time we've come around 9 or 10, and had no issues getting seats at the bar.

They also make the best French 75 I've ever had!
