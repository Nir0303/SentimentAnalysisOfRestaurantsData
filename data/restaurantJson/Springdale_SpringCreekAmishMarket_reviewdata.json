This place is a store in front and a comfy deli in the back much like a lot of old country stores. All the cold cuts and cheese are displayed. They also have beer. I had a half a ham and Swiss sandwich and a cup of exceptionally good soup. The place is pretty simple and looks like a family operation, but I would recommend it when you are looking for basic soup and sandwich in Downtown Springdale and close to the bike trail.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-05-06T10:54:58-0400", "location_id": "8001054", "id": "270406318", "user": {"username": "REDHOG", "user_location": {"name": "Rogers, AR", "id": null}}}]}
