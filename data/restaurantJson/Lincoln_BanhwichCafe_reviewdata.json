Served with chip and drink, very reasonable.  Outdoor seating for the nice days, and indoor seating for the rest.  About 20 varieties of bubble tea as well, including Vietnamese Coffee with coffee flavored bubbles.  Pretty nice little place, definitely going back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-11-03T11:51:37-0500", "location_id": "4711176", "id": "237822437", "user": {"username": "ET-MCMLX", "user_location": {"name": "Overland Park, Kansas", "id": "38969"}}}]}
