The restaurant is beautiful and I loved the atmosphere. I'm a vegetarian, so I always have to check out my options beforehand. We both wanted burgers, and the build-your-own section was perfect for me. There were so many gourmet/foodie choices that were so appetizing! I ordered a black bean burger with grilled pineapple, red pepper jam, avocado, and lettuce with a side of sweet potato fries. My hubby had the signature burger with the garlic parmesean fries. Everything was homemade, upscale, and elevated...except for my FROZEN BLACK BEAN BURGER PATTY that was a base charge of $8!!!!! It was the exact same frozen patty that I have at home in my freezer...I was so disappointed and shocked...I just couldn't believe that they would cheapen all of their efforts (all delicious, by the way) by using a frozen burger. I really wanted to say something to the server about it, but I didn't. I just don't understand why they wouldn't choose to follow through and make it from scratch. Hopefully management will read this review and make this change because this made a huge negative first impression on me, despite all of the other positive aspects of the meal.
