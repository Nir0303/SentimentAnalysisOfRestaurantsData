My patronage and unwavering support has now ended in the wake of the single most disastrous dining experience I have ever had.  Just one of the problems I experienced would be enough to aggravate even the most seasoned diner, but I experienced no less than 27 problems on this visit, some of which are so rare and offensive I am still struggling for the words to describe them.  I'll also say that I am not a fussy diner and the overwhelming majority of my reviews on Trip Advisor are positive as I generally like to use this platform to recommend rather than reject hotels and restaurants.  Without further adieu here are the reasons:\n1.\tA reservation could not be made by telephone in a timely manner because the person who answered the telephone was unable to make a reservation, twice.\n2.\tA credit card required to guarantee reservation on Open Table, which is kind of insulting given that I attempted to make reservations via telephone on two separate occasions which would not have required one.\n3.\tWe arrived at 1:40pm for a 2:00pm reservation to find close to 100 people waiting in the lobby of the hotel to eat.  I knew I was in trouble at this point, but I was being held hostage as they already had my credit card number.\n4.\tThe hostess immediately blamed the customers in the dining room for the delay.  She said people are taking longer than normal.  Who could have anticipated that people would linger at Christmas dinner?  I\u2019m pretty sure that everyone with half of a brain could have anticipated that.\n5.\tNumerous tables were open and set and many more needed to be cleared.  None of those tables ever had customers seated at them over the course of my 3 \u00bd hour stay.  \n6.\tThe hostess abandoned computerized reservation system and scrawled my name on a slip of receipt paper.  This was not the result of a computer crash and no one was able to explain to me how or why this was happening.  It is totally inexplicable, but it happened.\n7.\tI later learned that the hostess started seating whoever was in front of her and completely ignoring times of reservations or party sizes.\n8.\tAfter being told to wait in the hotel lobby no hostess or employee ever came to the lobby to call for any party, not just my party but any party at all.\n9.\tThe hostess refused to give me a wait time.  She refused to even tell me a ball park figure or the time of the reservations of those currently being seated.\n10.\tNo bartender was ever available at bar when I tried to get my wife a drink.  Waited for 10 minutes and 15 minutes and never saw one.  I did see two waiters pouring themselves drinks from the soda gun and both promised to get the bartender but none ever came.\n11.\tNever able to check with hostess as she was never at the stand on the four separate occasions that I attempted to check with her.\n12.\tA hotel employee repeatedly lied to me about why the wait was so extreme and the time of the reservations of the other guests that had been seated before my wife and I.  She kept saying \u201cthey are just a little backed up today\u201d which isn\u2019t actually possible given that this was a buffet.  How does the kitchen get behind at a buffet? \n13.\tAfter the hostess was retrieved by another employee for me one hour and 20 minutes into my wait.  She said she would seat me and then disappeared into the dining room to never be seen again.\n14.\tThe restaurant manager then told me at 3:15 (one hour and 35 minutes into my wait) that her advice is that I not even eat at the Crystal Room due to what she described as \u201cchallenges.\u201d\n15.\tThe manager then suggested that we eat elsewhere and that they would pay for my meal, but when I asked where that meal would be she was unable to offer even one suggestion of where that meal might take place.\n16.\tAfter offering for me to order from their a la carte menu the manager then sat me at a table next to buffet stations that were being disassembled.  I can only assume so that I could see what I was missing, or wanted the staff to have an audience while they carted off the dregs of the buffet.  Numerous other tables were available in that were not in the work zone of the buffet.\n17.\tWe were offered complimentary champagne which was served hot, not warm or room temperature, but hot like it had been stored in a boiler room.  It was undrinkable even to two people who had been trying to get a drink for two hours. \n18.\tOur waitress took 15 minutes to bring us menus for a la carte dining before disappearing for another 15 minutes.  This is in a restaurant that is fully staffed, half full, and serving a buffet.\n19.\tMy wife then ordered crab cakes and a steak from the menu and I ordered a salad and a club sandwich.  My wife was more optimistic than I at this point and I figured we are finally going to get something to eat, but I was right, they screwed up this seemingly simple order.\n20.\t20 minutes later the waitress returned to tell me that they were out of crab cakes.  When I asked what they could provide as an alternative she suggested that we look at a menu again.  I refused and advised her to cancel the rest of the order.  Actually I am fairly certain that the waitress could not speak or understand English at a level that would allow her to hold a job where she has to interact with the English speaking public.  I got a lot of blank stares.\n21.\tWe then ate random scraps of leftovers from a buffet that was sitting out for at least 5 hours as I was convinced that it was the only way that we would get anything to eat.  \n22.\tThe food later gave both my wife and I tremendous gastrointestinal distress making this not only one of the worst experiences I have ever had at any hospitality establishment it actually followed us home and continued into the next morning.\n23.\tOur a la carte order that had been cancelled 30 minutes earlier arrived at our table.\n24.\tThe $12 Ceaser Salad was the saddest, most wilted, most pathetic salad I have been served anywhere but a fast food restaurant.  Wendy\u2019s has a better ceaser, but they are closed on Christmas so I could not go get one.\n25.\tMy wife\u2019s steak was ordered medium-rare but was served at a temperature best described as well-ruined, hockey puck like, or inedible.\n26.\tThe manager who had previously promised to personally take care of us finally reappeared and promised that the General Manager would be contacting me to discuss our experience.  That never happened.\n27.\tAll of this madness went on despite the fact that the hotel and restaurant both appeared to be fully staffed.  There must have been at least 40 wait staff present, but they all seemed to be hiding from the customers rather than trying to serve anyone.\nAnd on a final note all of this occurred on my wife's birthday at an establishment that I had been touting as one of the finest holiday dining experiences one could have.

She did some research and liked the photos of this hotel/restaurant.  The first impression we got as we departed from the cab was spectacular!  The restaurant is in a white mansion that is now a hotel.  A doorman in a derby greeted us and led us to the restaurant.  The ceilings are very high and the walkway to the restaurant was furnished with what appeared to be antiques with a setting of the late 1800s.  We were seated by the fireplace which added to the atmosphere of eating in a by gone era. My wife order drum fish (similar to redfish) and I ordered the beef tips over noodles.  My wife\u2019s fish was excellent, but mine was average.  I must say my Manhattan was excellent, however.  We were celebrating my wife\u2019s birthday so to our surprise the chef came out and talked to my wife and our server provided us a complimentary dessert with a personalized message (Look at the photos to see it.)  Our server also took several photos of us dining and in front of the fireplace so we have memories for later.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable and memorable dinner.  I thought the value was reasonable for downtown New Orleans and very good for the beautiful atmosphere they maintain here.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-11-15T05:49:32-0500", "location_id": "2718771", "id": "326903631", "user": {"username": "Amease", "user_location": {"name": "Akron, Ohio", "id": "29912"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Warm Southern Charm", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d2718771-r318150846-m11068-The_Crystal_Room-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html#review318150846", "text": "The Crystal Room offers service with a warm southern hospitality and with the culinary talents of Chef Mendoza your palate is taken to new heights. Chef Mendoza offers an amazing Sunday Brunch from omelets of your choice made before your eyes, to shrimp and crab legs, to prime rib and salmon.  Several trips to the buffet were taken so we could get a sampling of all this Chef has to offer. One also needs to experience dinner, from seafood to filet to gumbo with the ambiance of the fire place and attentive staff you are taken back in time to a time of gentility.  The prime rib just melts away,  the gumbo gives one the taste of New Orleans, and the salmon was out of this world. Chef Mendoza I hear is working on a new menu and knowing that in itself makes one want to travel back to New Orleans to sample this Chef's tantalizing cuisine.  We have also mentioned Chef Mendoza's staff.  We would like to mention  a few dining staff that have warm, wonderful, and attentive personalities that offer service with a smile and want your dining experience to be over the top, and they are Frank and Jyllian.  Frank offers true southern hospitality and treats all guests like royalty.  Jyllian takes care in seeing that all guests are treated like family and that ones dining experience is complete from start to finish.  And in the bar area we have Pam.  Pam's sincere, outgoing and fun personality make for a wonderful close to one's day.
