We were looking for a great Sushi bar in Broward. Other diners seem to have been happy, we disagree.\n\nFrom our arrival we were surprised that the place does not look as nice in real life as the photos on the restaurant website suggest. The restaurant is more of a street food place as opposed to classy dining establishment.\n\nWe started with the grilled calamari appetizer and seaweed salad. The calamari was over cooked, smokey and presented in a way that brought to mind the urban myth of calamari actually being pig rectum. I had to overcome the visual aversion to try to like this dish. The seaweed salad was fair, oily and fishy.\n\nFor our main courses we tried various sushi rolls and ramen. I am a big fan of ramen when well done. Mine was not well done. The broth was poorly seasoned. This killed the soup. The noodles were not over done, the veggies were abundant, the added egg was a perfect medium, so that is a positive. The rolls were inconsistent in presentation, quality and taste.\n\nGoBistro does have a nice selection of both hot and chilled sake. Maybe if we drank more before the food arrived we would not have noticed the glaring deficiencies.\n\nI was amused by the ordering and payment system. The credit card was processed at the table on a tablet device. This is reminiscent of the way it is done at restaurants in Europe. It always made me feel more secure to not have my credit card taken away when paying a restaurant tab. This should become the norm and not the exception. In this way, GoBisto was avant-garde.

Over \"unhealthy\" for my taste, but they arrive so soon that you just eat!!! Did not have sushi, so next time I will rate it... Ramen soup... Looks better than it is... Do not get me wrong, it is good, but could improve in flavor.... Chef, go to work there.... We had the veggie soup!\nPlace is ok and looks clean... Service quite nice!\nEnjoy", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-01-18T20:31:03-0500", "location_id": "6754209", "id": "341095638", "user": {"username": "Jacques R", "user_location": {"name": "Miami, Florida", "id": "34438"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Best Ramen", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34296-d6754209-r340061979-m11068-GoBistro-Hollywood_Broward_County_Florida.html#review340061979", "text": "Love the fresh sashimi and the pork and curry ramen souo.
