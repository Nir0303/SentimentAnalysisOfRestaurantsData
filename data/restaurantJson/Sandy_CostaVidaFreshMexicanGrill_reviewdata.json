We (as a family) have really enjoyed this place.  The food has always been good but the service is just horrible.  Kids run it and it shows.  Don't ever order to go!  Have ordered by phone and on there new online program and both have been disappointing.  Wrong orders, cold food and even missing food.  When I have complained they even went as far to say come back to pick up items or we will send you a gift card.  Well the gift cards never came on two different occasions.  What a bummer this is (or was) my daughters favorite spot on Mommy/daughter dates.
