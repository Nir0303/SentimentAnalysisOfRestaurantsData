We ordered the Sugarbee waffle sandwich and the Breakfast panini sandwich. Both were tasty, although the chicken patty was of the heated-up variety. The kiwi-jalape\u00f1o relish on the Sugarbee waffle sandwich was great! And the waffle was very tasty.\n\nThe butter cake and the peanut butter bar were both excellent!  Good texture and nice flavor. \n\nThere are tables out in an indoor hallway to sit down to eat. Or the food comes served in take-away containers, so you have that option as well. \n\nThe service was pleasant, friendly, helpful, and efficient. \n\nTip:  if you don't mind a little walk, you can park across the street in the former Redlands mall parking lot.

I'M SO GLAD I DID!  I tried the Turkey Club Waffle Sandwich and it was amazing! Yes, it was on a waffle and the waffle was super light, fluffy, and tasty.  My friend had the caprese sandwich, which was also very delicious.  Overall, this was a fantastic lunch experience that I highly recommend. There are tables inside the nearby hallway out of the sun, although a little quaint for eating. Parking is tough on Citrus, but totally worth it!  I look forward to going back again soon so I can try their bakery items!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-07T15:25:04-0400", "location_id": "10384461", "id": "390226318", "user": {"username": "FireDawg22", "user_location": {"name": "Redlands, CA", "id": null}}}]}
