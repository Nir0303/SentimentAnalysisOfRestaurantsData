That helped!\n\nOn a Friday night the place was full and almost everyone was Asian. We ended up ordering several appetizers and an entree each and shared everything.\n\nOne of the apps was fried \"stinky tofu\" which is tofu that has fermented. I was prepared for the worst but it wasn't too bad. Overall reaction at our table was mixed. The best app was a combination of pancake and thin beef.\n\nMy favorite entree was Salt and Pepper Squid. Strips of squid were covered with a light tempura battered and fried beautifully - light and not greasy! Also quite good was Pork with Lotus Root. The taste was excellent although there was very little pork in the dish. Eggplant with Garlic Sauce was also quite good. \n\nLess successful were a fish stew with hot peppers. It didn't have much flavor aside from the peppers. We had Stir Fried Lamb with Spicy (sic) which had only one chili icon on the menu but was too hot for my somewhat timid taste.\n\nMy least favorite dish was a chicken dish that had the chicken sliced into rounds like silver dollars. There were bits of bone within it and you had to be careful eating it.\n\nThe service was quite good and, as is typical in Taiwan, the dishes came out as they were ready, in no particular order.\n\nOther odds and ends - they place looks a bit dumpy from the outside but looks much nicer inside. If you want beer your choice is Tsingtao. And that's it. They looked to have some open wine bottles in a refrigerator case but none of us wanted to try that.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience and I believe that we will return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-20T12:10:42-0400", "location_id": "2187523", "id": "301591534", "user": {"username": "TheRealAwaxy", "user_location": {"name": "Durham, North Carolina", "id": "49092"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Taipei 101 is world class!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49007-d2187523-r299976620-m11068-Taipei_101-Cary_North_Carolina.html#review299976620", "text": "I stumbled upon Taipei 101 about 2 weeks ago while doing my routine search for good Chinese food in the Cary Area. I have become accustomed to being disappointed whenever I search, but this time to my delight I found my new go to place. Upon entering this restaurant for dinner I was very happy to see that the restaurant was completely filled with customers, (mostly Asian). Let's face it, when I go to a great Italian Restaurant, I want to see  that its filled with Italians, after all, if they like it.... right?? So my expectations and my taste buds were up already. Here's the good news, the food was fantastic. I ordered egg drop soup (which wasnt even on the menu) and I must say, if that is the way the soups is supposed to taste, then I have never really experienced a great egg drop soup before now. It was amazing, as was the Potstickers and the Pecan Shrimp with Broccoli dinner. I highly recommend you try this restaurant for a great tasting authentic dinner. They also serve lunch. Portions are good size, prices pretty reasonable. There are quite a number of unusual items on the menu for the more adventurous types. It appears to be family run. Their brand new menus are beautiful (they tell me that they had them done in China!). Perhaps all restaurants should print their menus there. This one is one you will certainly want to try. Finally, great tasting authentic Chinese cuisine right here in downtown Cary.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-08-16T11:51:53-0400", "location_id": "2187523", "id": "299976620", "user": {"username": "katielyne926", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "nice place, nice food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49007-d2187523-r293576657-m11068-Taipei_101-Cary_North_Carolina.html#review293576657", "text": "we went there for lunch. the outside doesnt do justice to the interiors.
