Started off with just happy hour. It doesnt have many items on the list but the fact that it runs 7 days a week makesup for it. 3 beers on tap for just over $1 (miller light , tecate and dos equis) and 2.25 for the margaritas. (Frozen or on the rocks) . The micheladas are good too , ( not part of happy hour though). As far as the food goes the only item that i personally didnt care for was the calamari, it was just ok. My favorite is the prepared oysters. They come with ceviche , shrimp and agua chile sauce, a must try in my opinion. Another item i like is the cheese enchiladas and the costa azul. For sharing the molcajete is perfect for 2-3 ppl. Its either beef , chicken or fish or all 3 depending on what u order in a chilli , cheese broth ,its really good , and is served with beans and rice on the side. Overall , i love the margaritas during happy hour and the oysters , i would reccomend to everyone.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-13T17:17:29-0400", "location_id": "5051504", "id": "299008198", "user": {"username": null, "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
