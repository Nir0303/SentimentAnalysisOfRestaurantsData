Then someone comes from the back with a bag and says 2 No.2's and it was $11 plus change. For 6 pieces of chicken?  No, for 2 No. 2s.....wife gave up, came home and guess what?  No dark meat. So, she did't get want she ordered, paid for a dry roll and greasy, soggy french fries and none of she ordered.  On top of that it was THE greasiest chicken ever.
