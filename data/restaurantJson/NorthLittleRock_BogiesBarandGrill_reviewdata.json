We  started eating at Bogie's about a year ago on a http://restaurant.com certificate.  It quickly became our favorite place to eat.  We would drive from Heber Springs (over 1 hr) just to eat at Bogie's.  Unfortunately, our last trip was such a disappointment that we will not return.  The food took 45 min to arrive.  Their signature sandwich (the Monte Cristo) was a wonderful deep fried delight that this time was cooked in grease that was not hot enough, so it was a greasy inedible mess.  The french fries were undercooked and obviously cooked in grease that fish had been cooked in.  We would have sent our food back but we had already waited so long that we did not wish to stay any longer.  I was able to go to the bar and get the waitress to stop flirting with the bar patrons long enough to give me my ticket.
