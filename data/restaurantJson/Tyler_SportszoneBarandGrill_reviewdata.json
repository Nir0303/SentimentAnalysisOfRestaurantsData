First, I appreciated the volume being turned up when the game started and actually got some of the other patrons wrapped up in the game with me, YeaH!! I had some special dietary considerations I asked to be accommodated when I went to request an order of food. The young lady stated she would try, but because the cook only spoke Spanish, she wasn't certain how close my accommodation would come. I mention to her I'm fluent in Spanish and if he's comfy coming out, I can help with my request. She comes back and says, I think we're good, he seems to know what it is you'd like. I'm so appreciative, because, yes, it was PERFECT!! \nThe serving size was so much, too, that I was able to take home 1/2 for the next days' breakfast, perfect when staying in a hotel, and the price for what I'd ordered was spot on.\nThe Rangers beat the Astros, another YeaH!! and to celebrate, I ask the bartender what she would recommend for a specialty shot based upon things I like and don't like, and I don't recall what it was called, but she nailed it, getting just the right mix of not too sweet, fun, not knocking me off my feet, and yet potent.\nNow I see why this place was recommended and even went back  the next night.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-30T13:41:13-0400", "location_id": "5541075", "id": "315185902", "user": {"username": "BlaundNordic", "user_location": {"name": "Tyler, Texas", "id": "56797"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Sportzone", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56797-d5541075-r226446875-m11068-Sportszone_Bar_and_Grill-Tyler_Texas.html#review226446875", "text": "Friendly bartenders.
