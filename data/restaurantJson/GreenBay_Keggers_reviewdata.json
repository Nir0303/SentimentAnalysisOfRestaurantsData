But what Keggers also has is great bar service, a private outdoor smoking area, and one of the best stage/sound system set ups that a \"bar\" can offer.

We thought it might be a nice little pub because it's located in the heart of the renovated section of Broadway.  \n\nKeggers serves no food, except Hydrant frozen pizza.  They also serve no wine, except one \"red\" and one \"white\".  Neither variety is potable.  If you like beer or hard liquor, you're in luck.  Drinks average less than $4 each.\n\nThe pub consists of a large round bar that takes up most of the room, and two high tables at the front window.  You can't get table service - you have to go up to the bar to order your beverage.  \n\nThe karaoke is awful.  Beginning at 9:30, the DJ cranks the volume so high that you literally must yell at the person sitting next to you, to have a conversation.  As a participant, you can't hear yourself sing.  Asking Mr. DJ  to please turn it down a notch is futile.\n\nWe had one drink and left because we were becoming deaf in less than half an hour.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-10-03T20:13:54-0400", "location_id": "5038368", "id": "232472023", "user": {"username": "ML T", "user_location": {"name": "Florida", "id": "28930"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-09", "title": "average", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g59929-d5038368-r232064094-m11068-Keggers-Green_Bay_Wisconsin.html#review232064094", "text": "music on weekend and Wed. during summer 2 fors 3-7 typical workin  class bar till 7 21 to 30s night time", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-10-01T08:08:32-0400", "location_id": "5038368", "id": "232064094", "user": {"username": "Richard S", "user_location": {"name": "Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States", "id": null}}}]}
