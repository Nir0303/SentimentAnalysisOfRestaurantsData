It was so good I've now been back twice with two other groups of friends and we have all agreed, we loved it.  Meals are great but I could really make a meal of the appetizers.  In each case we ordered a lot because we wanted to try a little bit of everything.  My favorites are the papa & pernil empadadillas (sp?) and the guandules dip.  I'm not gluten-free but I'm guessing this place might be a good choice for those who are gluten-free because they use a a lot of plantains instead of bread (but not always).  For example, I had a pulled pork (pernil) sandwhich which used two big sheets of fried plantains instead of bread (it was a special but each time I've been there it was one of the specials).  \nCasual atmosphere.
