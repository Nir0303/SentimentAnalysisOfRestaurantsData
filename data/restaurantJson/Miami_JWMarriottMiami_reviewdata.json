The long and short of it is although a great location which is easily accessible for what Miami has to offer and great staff, this hotel is dated and desperately needs updates. Most of the guest rooms have a terrible musty, almost moldy smell to them. Upon arrival we were placed on concierge level for our Marriott status but entered into a room that immediately knocked us out with the musty smell that was unbearable. We asked to change rooms and were placed 1 story down to a room with a balcony and a slightly more tolerable odor. Any type of odor of any kind is unacceptable unless of course it is pleasant and on purpose. We stayed here a couple months ago and noticed the same thing so I would be hard pressed to believe that this issue is just in the rooms we were placed in. Decor and color scheme is dark and outdated; time to change the yellow walls. Bathrooms are somewhat updated with mirrors that have tvs in them which I believe to be a terrible use of monies as the need for more practical, hygienic and aesthetic updates is obvious. \n\nI am typically a very positive person and love to give good ratings but it's really hard to give the hotel even the 3 stars. Friendly faces at check in, valet and concierge services are always nice, but at the end of day a comfortable, clean, safe welcoming hotel room to come back to at the end of the day is what matters most. Truly I had a headache from the smell in our rooms each time I entered them which is unacceptable; I'm of good health and am not particularly sensitive to odors in general so this has to tell you something. \n\nFor future visits, we will take our business elsewhere, unless Marriott decides to renovate and improve the quality of their rooms here.

A single couch in an otherwise huge room. Food in the bar was surprisingly good. I ate just before closing; one employee seemed annoyed that my flight was late. The other was happy and chatty. Food in the breakfast / lunch dining area was good, although the waitress could take lessons from the desk staff for customer service.
