We waited to be seated for quite some time while 3 bartenders stood chatting, looking at us and chose to ignore that we weren't being helped.   Waitress didn't seem interested in anything about her job except socializing.   It took us forever to eat our meal.   Can't say we'd be back.   But if your in the area, it's likely the best place on High St compared to some of the other places we saw.   Longboards was advertising Hawaiin food and had Hawaiin prices to boot!   Sorry Longboards, but it's Va by a bay, not a secluded island!   \n\nI will say that as the day got later the people going there in droves seemed like what you'd see in a gangster video!
