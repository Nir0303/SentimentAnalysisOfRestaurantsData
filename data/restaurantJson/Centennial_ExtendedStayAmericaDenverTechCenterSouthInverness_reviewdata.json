It had modern colors and fresh cozy feel.  I particularly liked the sprayed coating on the porcelain tile in the shower.\n\n I believe this room was referred to as a Queen studio. It was fairly small but had a good use of space. I was able to park 10 feet from my door.\n\nThe air conditioner cooled well and was not obnoxiously loud.\n\nIt was quiet and I felt safe.\n\nCons:\nWhen I stepped out of my car upon arrival I was immediately met with a strong chemical smell. There are some wet paint signs around but this actually smelled like an insecticide.  We will give them the benefit of the doubt. I didn't notice this smell very much when I first entered my room but during the night after the air conditioner had been running a long time it became quite noticeable and I was slightly concerned for my health.  UPDATE:  I have since found that the strong paint smell was on the staircase immediately outside my door. It's some kind of special floor paint as it is on the steps in the stairwell so that is probably why I didn't recognize the smell.\n\nThe bed sheets and shower had hair from a previous visit. I did not address this with the hotel staff as I've learned to just carry a sleeping bag to use on the bed in these cases.\n\nThe room lacked clothes hangers and the sheer window curtain. If you open the main curtain for light you could come face-to-face with passersby.\n\nThe fluorescent tube light fixtures in bathroom and kitchen we're exposed having no shade.  Bathroom exhaust fan was loud.\n\nSummary:\nOverall I like this place. This was my first stay as I found my regular lodging full. Hopefully next time they will be finished painting and perhaps have improved their housekeeping.\n\n(All pictures are post stay except for the hair on the sheet.  The long curly hair in the shower hd been camouflaged on the painted shower wall, but fell down before the photo.  There was other hair in the shower.)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-16T05:29:59-0400", "location_id": "119983", "id": "383114883", "user": {"username": "Neal T", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Worst, don't stay!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33412-d119983-r376522508-m11068-Extended_Stay_America_Denver_Tech_Center_South_Inverness-Englewood_Colorado.html#review376522508", "text": "This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have traveled alot and stayed in wide range of hotels. We stayed here for about 4 months, My children have found drug pipes and needles in the parking lot, the grounds are not kept, trash and bottles everywhere. The cleaning crew do not clean the rooms very well, we had friends check in and there daughter found a heroine pipe in there cleaned room, the cleaning people didn't even come to our room for about 5 weeks straight and ask if we needed anything. Besides Larry, the other staff are rude and snappy when you ask or report anything. Due to staff neglect, guests get hurt. If you have a problem the staff tell you to call corporate, and when you call corporate they do nothing, don't document, or return calls. It took me calling for over 5 weeks to finally peak with someone, all you get is the run around! Corporate will tell you different things about the rates and programs and how they work to lock in your price but the price continues to go up, started out at 1,100, first month, second month went to 1,300., third month went to 1,900. And the forth month was over 2,000. All while we were supposed to be in the EPP program with locked rate at 1,100. A month. They even harass you, they harassed my husband to pay our bill at another hotel (that we had never been to) and our bill wasn't even due for another 2 weeks, then when they realized they made a mistake they never apologized. The rooms are not stocked with anything like they advertise, and thier breakfast is a joke.

This was my experience at this hotel and no amount of complaint to the staff- including a call to the regional manager ever resolved the horrible conditions. Even though I had a King Suite, I was forced to purchase a separate room for my family who was visiting from out of state because getting them a good nights rest in my room was out of the question.

Kitchen, bathroom and the room itself are all looking good.\n\nStill I have some complaints with this property.\n-The heater/cooler makes noise every single time you turn them ON.\n\n-Some of the electrical sockets doesn't work.\n\n-Had my shower drainage chocked, 4 times in a month. It wouldn't drain at all.\n\n-Onsite laundry was not available for 2 straight weeks. Their answer to it was \"use our neighboring property's laundry\".\nAnd the neighboring property(about a Block away)in the laundry facility dryer does not work properly. 90mins of drying clothes and the clothes were still damp.\n\n-staffs are rude. Customer experience is below par compared to any hotel.\n\n- the dark complexioned guy was being rude and showing bad attitude when I was checking for my mail at the mail box that was hanging at the front desk near the entrance. If the mailbox was not for customers to check up on, don't hang it at the entrance. It was obviously above the free newspapers at the front desk(which was for grabs).\n\n- the dark complexioned lady was rude when I called the front desk for the fourth time the shower was not draining water(all chocked up with dirty soap water early in the morning before starting for my business)\n Inspire of me telling her to ask her manager to call me in my cell phone. And giving my cell number again. Someone had called the room telephone and left a voicemail. Have you guys given guest's voicemail access??? Well I was not informed about it.\n\n-the corridors are not cleaned properly, there is always some trash here and there at the staircases, corridors, etc outside the rooms.\n\n-the garbage barrels are below staircases which is always dirty.\n\nSuggestions to improve:\n\n- teach your staff how to treat your customers properly.\n\n- Do some sort of inspection every month at the property.\n\n- Start recycling bottles/tins/cans/cardboards etc at all your properties.\n\n- keep it clean.\n\n- if the property cannot provide some service due to some problem from your side compensate your customers without them asking for it. You come forward and admit your property's fault. Inform your customers about the known problems and apologize for their inconvenience. Don't try to hide your mistakes.\n\n- the new renovations are good. Keep inspecting all the aspects of the rooms before renting it to your customers. \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-12-19T14:27:54-0500", "location_id": "119983", "id": "333930595", "user": {"username": "saravana0031", "user_location": {"name": "Denver, Colorado", "id": "33388"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-12", "title": "Susan H.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33412-d119983-r331847124-m11068-Extended_Stay_America_Denver_Tech_Center_South_Inverness-Englewood_Colorado.html#review331847124", "text": "Wonderful experience from check in friendly staff (Larry) to the breakfast- grab and go-muffins, fruit, oatmeal and great coffee ( hot cocoa and tea also ) Comfortable bed, amenities - hair dryer, extra fluffy towels, kitchen to make meals and beautiful decor.
