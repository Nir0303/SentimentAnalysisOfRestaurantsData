They should be graded on both counts.\nEntertainment value is definitely there. This guy was funny but his humor was not for everyone. If you get offended easily, This chef is not for you. haha\nI can see why so many prefer him after watching the chefs at the nearby tables do a standard textbook hibachi performance. That may be good for your first time but having been to these types of restaurants about 10+ times a year I am jaded and not  looking for the typical \"Volcano\" or \"choo choo\" onion.\nJust off entertainment we would request his chef again.\n\nFood comes next on this review and I will have to say it was OK. its not a steak that is going to blow you away (We had steak and rice dishes) but it was a meal you would not mind repeating. The price seems about on par with other restaurants of this sort and it was a great way to spend 1.5 hours on a Friday night.\n\nIf you are looking for amazing food, you can do better but you would be hard pressed to find a better deal for entertainment and eating all in one.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-07-04T12:50:01-0400", "location_id": "2637045", "id": "285604515", "user": {"username": "psychocabbage", "user_location": {"name": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "id": "34094"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-06", "title": "geart place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34094-d2637045-r278559010-m11068-Kimura-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html#review278559010", "text": "Again I want to review this place.
