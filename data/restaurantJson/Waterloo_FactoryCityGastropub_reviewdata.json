Went in there and sat at the bar. Bartender looked right at me and kept working. I finally asked her for a drink and then had to request the one page menu. Ordered a cheeseburger and was asked to pay when I ordered. I see why. Got to witness two customer confrontations over slow service while I waited a really long time for food that was kinda hot and had no flavor. Next time, McDonalds.

Took over an hour to get our food and my simple cup of coffee took almost thirty minutes. Sad part was, we were the ONLY table in the restaurant so I'm not sure why service was so slow. The food however was fine. Nothing to brag about. After the service we received I was cringing at the thought of what the food may be like, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't horrible. They need a restaurant manager who knows what they are doing and can train staff better. Overall, this place is terribly mismanaged.
