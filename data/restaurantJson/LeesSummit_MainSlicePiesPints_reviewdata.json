The building was a cool brick historic building on Main St with lots of character. Love the vintage neon. The pizza by the slice were big and looked great. We ordered a 14\" pie though and it was thin but not too thin. It had a beautiful crisp charred crust only achieved with a great fresh dough and a scorching hot oven. We had mushrooms, fresh baby spinach and large pepperoni. Spinach and mushrooms had a fantastic flavor and the pepperoni was excellent!! Reminded me of some great pizza from home and happy to find such a fresh well made pizza here. Great job guys!!
