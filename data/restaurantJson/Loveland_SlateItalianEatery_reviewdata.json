Service was excellent and friendly, but a little too speedy...even though we arrived at 7:00, and there were tables available throughout our stay, we had the feeling we were being hurried through our dinner...salad served along with appetizer, main course served before we were completely finished with our salad, etc. The appetizer of prosciutto and melon was excellent, and our house Caesar was tasty, with tiny peppers that were a happy addition. Main courses: I ordered the appetizer size calamari (unbreaded and very good, but my husband's order of eggplant parmigiana was one of the worst he had ever eaten, and it is usually a favorite of his...thick and dry. The side cauliflower was very good however. I received a complimentary dessert to celebrate my birthday...ice cream with a wine reduction topping that was to die for. My husband ordered the Tiramisu, and  it was not exceptional, but acceptable. \nWe will be back to try again...order some other selections that might be more to our liking.

We went for dinner on Friday evening, during Night on the Town.  The restaurant has a classy, yet casual, comfortable feel, which is enhanced by the friendly and attentive staff.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the food.  My wife had eggplant parmigiana, which is one of her favorites.  This dish is usually prepared with layered thinly sliced eggplant, but this one was made with two individual thick slices, which detracted from the meal.  It was served with polenta, which was too dry, and roasted cauliflower, which was very good.  I ordered cioppino, which had plenty of clams, mussels and calamari, but which was lacking any swordfish, which the menu mentioned.  The broth was very salty, a definite drawback to this dish.  For dessert, we shared cannolis, which were served drizzled with dark chocolate, and were quite good.  I asked for decaf coffee, and was informed that they had none (I don\u2019t know if this was a temporary or permanent situation).  The prices for the meals were very reasonable.\nDowntown Loveland could benefit from a good Italian restaurant, and the location could help draw people off of 4th Street to some of the other nearby businesses.  A bit of tweaking to the preparation could make this a great addition to Loveland.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-09T07:57:03-0400", "location_id": "10479201", "id": "390722318", "user": {"username": "BH51", "user_location": {"name": "Loveland, Colorado", "id": "33530"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Outstanding Food and Service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33530-d10479201-r389897116-m11068-Slate_Italian_Eatery-Loveland_Colorado.html#review389897116", "text": "We tried the Slate Italian Eatery recently to celebrate a special occasion, and we were not disappointed. As mentioned here in Trip Advisor, this is a new restaurant in downtown Loveland, CO. The restaurant is locally owned and managed, and the attention to detail was reflective of this throughout our meal.\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed, yet modern, and we were greeted promptly upon entering the restaurant. Although we dined during the lunch rush during the week, we were seated without delay. \n\nAll food is prepared fresh daily and made from scratch, including the pasta, and this was quite obvious, whether you took your first bite of food, or your last. We started out with the Fennel Salami Bruschetta, followed by a Three Bean cup of soup and small Caesar Salad. Our entrees consisted of the Lunch Bolognese and Chicken Parmesan, and we finished with desserts of Tiramisu and Blueberry Trifle. \n\nLunch portions are smaller than most fine dining restaurants, which was perfect for us. Our server, Ashley, was superb, very attentive, and she took her time explaining the menu and answering all of our questions when we told her this was our first visit to the Slate.  \n\nBottom line: We will surely return to the Slate again, next time for dinner.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-06T14:35:25-0400", "location_id": "10479201", "id": "389897116", "user": {"username": "divemoreworkless", "user_location": {"name": "Colorado", "id": "28927"}}}]}
