It was the same story both times. They make good drinks. My wife and I like almost all iterations of whiskey but especially bourbon. The list is good and cocktails are good. It's rarely absolutely packed but it is usually bustling, which makes for good ambiance, along with dim lighting and a lot of brick, wood, and bourbon paraphernalia. The service leaves much to be desired. Very much. Both times we were quickly greeted but the attentiveness stopped there. Slow to get drinks we ordered, very slow to offer a second and/or third round, and very slow to bring a tab. Not just slow, but unaware. Both times we were in the highest traffic area of the place (by the servers' entrance/exit from behind the bar) and were repeatedly passed by our server without a single look toward our empty glasses or any eye contact. Basic service skills being missed. I can handle a server who is just in the weeds or an understaffed bar because someone called in, but the idea of glancing at your guests' tables as you pass and/or checking on them is service 101 and is not understood here. We will begrudgingly return because it's across the street from the theater or because we want a nightcap after dinner nearby, but it's not somewhere we'll seek out because we know the service will likely be subpar.
