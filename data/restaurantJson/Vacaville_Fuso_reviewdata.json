The dining room is in a smaller, quiet room behind the bar and there is an area for al fresco dining in nice weather. The cuisine is Northern Italian with some American food choices and it's terrific in both taste and portion size.  Server was attentive, but not intrusive.  The restaurant is nicely decorated with old world styling including faux stone columns---reminiscent of a small restaurant in Rome or Florence.  Open kitchen design is a nice touch;  enjoyable to watch the chef preparing your meal as you watch.  In my opinion, Fuso's is the only really \"fine dining\" restaurant in Vacaville.

We have dinner once a month with\nfriends.. The restaurant has a small, intimate feeling and nice atmosphere.  The quiet setting lends itself to private conversations with your guests.  They also have an outdoor area for eating along with portable heaters if needed.  It's great to sit outdoors or inside.  The food includes a variety of European cuisine, including Italian and French.  Their American dishes are also quite tasty. .We've never been disappointed with the food or service. The prices vary with the entrees one orders.  We like to go on Sunday evenings and the staff allows us to linger at dinner..  Also, they serve after dinner aperitifs and flavored coffee drinks.  If you can fit it in, we sometimes share a dessert(s) with each other.  I love their tiramisu! .", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-17T13:10:34-0500", "location_id": "2264587", "id": "348655956", "user": {"username": "vacajeanie", "user_location": {"name": "Vacaville, California", "id": "33208"}}}]}
