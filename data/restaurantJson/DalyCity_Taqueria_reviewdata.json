Went there two or three times in my 2nd week of travel to Daly City, because I didn't know about it the first week.\n\nJust catty-corner to the In 'n' Out Burger, whose drive through line is always inexplicably into Sullivan street and around the corner -- this place beats the heck out if it!\n\nHad two excellent Carnitas/Spicy tacos - both soft and crispy - and enjoyed each pair thoroughly.  I think I preferred the crispy for the added texture.\n\nAlso had a carnitas burrito (regular) which was very good and satisfying.  Three for three!   Inexpensive, too.\n\nHighly recommended if you're in the neighborhood, or are at the Hampton Inn about 5 blocks north.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-10-13T10:28:21-0400", "location_id": "4976270", "id": "318330442", "user": {"username": "Richard R", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
