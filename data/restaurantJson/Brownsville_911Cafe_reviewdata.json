Everything I have tried has been freshly prepared, tasty, and best of all...not the usual Tex-Mex with lots of grease dripping everywhere.\n\nI have had their breakfast tacos, lunch plates, and soup, and I have yet to be disappointed in the food or the service. The owner or one of his family members will wait on you, and they are very friendly and accommodating. The food comes out fast. Plus, they will deliver to nearby places. \n\nI have eaten Mexican food all over Texas, the US, and Mexico, and this is right up there with some of the best IMO, and I suggest giving them a try.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-07-08T15:46:46-0400", "location_id": "10524662", "id": "390548502", "user": {"username": "whipster", "user_location": {"name": "Texas Gulf Coast, Texas", "id": "1438846"}}}]}
