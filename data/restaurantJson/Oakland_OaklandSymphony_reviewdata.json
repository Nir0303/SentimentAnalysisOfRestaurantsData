Maestro Michael Morgan, the tireless, fearless, magnificent music director and conductor of the Oakland Symphony always brings his audience to musical destinations that are lovely to listen to, informative to learn about and beyond the norm. I have been a season ticket holder for many years and although not all the pieces played by the orchestra have been to my liking, I'm ALWAYS glad that I've been exposed to music I wouldn't otherwise have heard. Of course, there's always the tried and true music which is so satisfying to hear played by such accomplished musicians. Sometimes there are soloists, singers, dancers (yes! dancers!) and instruments brought on stage that you've never seen nor heard before!
