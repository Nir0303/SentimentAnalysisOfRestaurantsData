The lobby and eating area were very nice and there was the usual breakfast fare with evening food provided Monday-Wednesday.

We were in town for our 4th grade son's football team to go to West Kentucky University game and be able to go out on the field with the players. My husband,  son, and I, stayed in the two-bedroom Suite with a pull out couch with another family.\nWhen we arrived to the hotel we were about 20 minutes early, but it did not because guest services got to work and merely to check the sent. soon as you walk in the hotel gives off that homie and clean nature. There is refreshments that are complementary at check-in for you to take advantage of while you wait at the front desk which we did not have to wait but still took advantage of the refreshments. As we got up to our room it was spectacularly clean no dust no mold no cracks I was immediately relieved. Now mind you I am a germophobe and no matter what I carry my alcohol and disinfectant spray. I go in and check the hotel rooms before anyone who's with me comes in the hotel, and I spray all my spray. I did not feel the need to go overboard when spraying my chemicals. Now the first room did not have the pull out bed as we had book. So call down to the desk to find out why we were not getting the room that was booked. Now I was told they only had one room with the two bedroom suite with a couch that pulled out. We were offered this but in my mind I was thinking why didn't we get that world since that is what we booked in the first place. My husband and I guess was that the room was not all the way ready yet. So immediately I returned to the front desk to get the keys to the room that was right down the hall that met all our requirements. The fact that we was not given this room at first bothered me but it did not take away from my stay. The outside pool was wonderful to take advantage of but the coloring was massive so be aware because the children and I had burning eyes almost immediately. The pool was open until 11 p.m. which was great because it allowed us to go and explore Mammoth Cave and come back and still let the children swim. Location was amazing as this hotel is around all different restaurants diagonal from Kroger's and ten minutes from the college. So I rate this top notch minus the small little glitches!

This motel looked wonderful when we drove up, but looks can be deceiving. Apparently, this hotel has a very low charge for pets, so watch out if you don't appreciate hearing dogs barking or staying at a hotel that smells of dogs.  We heard dogs barking in rooms, running down the hall with kids, even walked past a door propped open and blocked with a baby gate to keep a dog in.  Dogs are welcome in every room in the motel too.  Enough is enough!  We have stayed at many Staybridge Suites and have never experienced this.  This motel felt more like an overpriced kennel than one that is concerned about its guests.  Also, be prepared to have the fire alarm blast in your room, even if you are not cooking. This is a first too but was told to expect it to happen again. Must be that the guests there can't cook very well. Another first, very annoying situation!  Will I stay at another Staybridge Suites in the future?  Probably, but I will never stay this particular hotel ever again.

As those of you that may follow me know that I am extremely fair in my options whether I stayed for free or whether it be family owned. I call it like I see it.\nSoooo, again, from the guy that stays in approx 30 different hotels a yr all over this country...... STAYBRIDGE SUITES 680 Campbell lane Bowling Green is a very clean and very new place (2010 build). All the amenities are true and accurate for the most part. Though I didn't use the pool I noted it was used quite frequently. My only issue with an amenity was the power exercise bike is electronic and did not work properly. It was, is, broke.\nFor such a new place, like most hotels, the tub is backed up with the usual ??????. Ugh! So was the sink. No biggie, we are all used to that but not usually in a newer place. My issue and reason for a 3 star rating? A portion of the staff. STAY AWAY from the 1st floor closest the pharmacy, though this same house maid may cover the whole first. For what ever reason, she IS MISERABLE! Even so I tipped her every day. She obviously got complacent with the tips as the room was getting dirtier and dirtier to the point where it was not cleaned at all. I had no choice after nine days to ask for my garbage to be dumped, resupply toilet paper and change my bed sheets, resupply towels, etc...With those statements made to management, the head housekeeper brought that specific maid to my room which obviously made things much worse. It is obvious that this maid has been there much longer than the head housekeeper, who did nothing to resolve the problems. In short, the problems just got worse. So now, naturally,have not been tipping. Than the phone calls started. Keep in mind that these phone calls must come from an internal source as all outside calls must go through the front desk. My calls were from AA. I keep a case of beer in my room and I guess that's all this old miserable maid could come up with. She obviously wasn't too bright as both calls were made before 7 PM. That's all it took for me to unplug both phones. Problem solved! I could go on and on as the situations spread to some young attitude at the front desk that obviously was scared of the same maid.....or was friends with her as their personalities seemed to be identical. So long story shortened......., after 12 days I switched rooms to the second floor where I commenced to tip that HOUSEKEEPER much much more just for spite. I hope that maid on the first floor reads this and takes note of what personal actions can cost if those personal issues are brought to work and taken out on the very people that pay your bills. \nSo would I stay there again? The answer is yes as 80% of the people were very nice as was maintenance when I called to have my ice maker fixed. \nIn closing, just stay away from the first floor pharmacy side. Good luck and enjoy the free dinners every MON, Tues and Wed night.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "IHGService, Guest Relations Manager at Staybridge Suites Bowling Green, responded to this review", "text": "Dear kodiakcj,\n \nThank you for your feedback regarding your stay at Staybridge Suites Bowling Green, KY.
