I called my mom and got the # because she was the one who had the card, I gave it the the front desk clerk and we were given a key. We went to our room for a bit then left to our all day concert (ozzfest) we returned to our room at approx 11:30 pm to find we could not get into our room after trying a few times we went into the office to find out why. The front desk clerk told me the credit card had been declined, I did not understand this and why They would need to charge the card again so agian I call my mom to find out That infact the card was charged 4 day's prior to my arrival at the hotel. I was told I could pay to pay cash, and get my refund from online through the company I used. I told him I would pay  but would need a reciept as proof that I had to pay again, when I told him that he said \"oh\" the card went through. \nAfter all that we went to our room and later on found out there where roaches in the room. We encounter 3 other couples who had the same problems as I did. Never the less  after all the frusteration I did not go back to the desk clerk I just killed the roaches and left on the floor for them. \nThis was a total waste of time and money spent at this hotel and believe It I will never stay at this place again.I was also disapointed to find out that hotel was  not 2 miles from my concert (when I mapped it)  but infact 30 miles from my concert .\n\nThe Mendoza's\n", "helpful_votes": "5", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2007-07-17T20:00:00-0400", "location_id": "227795", "id": "8183329", "user": {"username": "nascarfansantarosaca", "user_location": {"name": "santa rosa ca", "id": null}}}]}
