Sandra did not greet us at all, just gave us a look like she didnt want us there. I ask for the sub of the day and she picked up chicken breast and i told her it was turkey day. She threw the chicken and continued to throw and slam things the entire time she made my sub and my husbands. When we finally paid for our subs I told her that I hoped her day got better because she seemed to be a woman who hated her job. She just turned around and walked in the back. Awful customer service.
