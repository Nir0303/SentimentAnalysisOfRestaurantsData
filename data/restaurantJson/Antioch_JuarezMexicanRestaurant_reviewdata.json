It's located on the corner of 18th and A St. in the old Swensen's ice cream parlor location. It's kind of shabby and could really use some sprucing up but the food is decent. A lot of people think it's not authentic because the food is on the mild or bland side. I don't agree. I don't like my Mexican food very hot & spicy anyway so for me it's just right. My husband doesn't like it at all. He \nwon't even go there. So I'm on my own when I visit Juarez. \nThey have all the standard fare as far as Mexican food goes, and it's all pretty good. My favorite is the steak fajita burrito. It's pretty plain, just meat, green bell peppers and onions but I like it. I also like their Fajitas. There again, no-frills, they come with just rice and beans. My husband thinks they're too expensive for what you get at $11. But I think it's pretty good size serving so I don't mind. \nThey could use a little friendlier people at the counter when you order too.  \nThe ladies at the counter can be a little on the grumpy side so make sure you know what you want when its your turn or you'll get the \"Soup Nazi\" attitude.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about \nJuarez is they are kind of cheap. And I don't mean cheap as in prices. They are the only Mexican restaurant in the whole town that charges extra for Salsa & Chips. This is something new that they just implemented at the end of 2012.  At that time they raised their prices overall and started charging an extra $2 for a small portion of chips \nand salsa with NO refills. It's kind \nof a tradition around here that Chips & Salsa are included as part of your dine in meal so I've noticed \nIt doesn't seem as busy as it used to be. I don't understand the \nreasoning behind this because it's obvious it has affected their \nbusiness. I've actually seen \ncustomers walk out once they see \nthe sign \"Chips & Salsa $1.99.
