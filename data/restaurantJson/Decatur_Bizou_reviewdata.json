The fish was dry and the asparagus was over grilled. I ordered the vegan stir fry and it too was over grilled. \nThe menu offerings include no entr\u00e9e salads.  \nWe will likely eat here again next year only as a courtesy to our planning host. \nWe would not dine here of our own free will and accord.
