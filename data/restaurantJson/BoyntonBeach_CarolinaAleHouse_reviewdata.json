My mother is gluten free and they offer a gluten free menu.  she ordered GF pizza . it was tasty. when we asked the waitress if it was made there she said the pizza shell is frozen GF but they add the sauce and toppings.  My mother enjoyed it and she is picky.  I had chicken sandwich on brioche roll. it was okay.  my father had the salmon and he loved it.  the menu does say it is wild salmon and not farm raised.  I would recommend this place if you are in the mood for this type of restaurant. there is lots of seating, booths high tops, outdoor and bar seating.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-03-13T06:42:43-0400", "location_id": "2630632", "id": "355004375", "user": {"username": "cathihes", "user_location": {"name": "Binghamton, New York", "id": "47320"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "Average Bar food place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34094-d2630632-r354555964-m11068-Carolina_Ale_House-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html#review354555964", "text": "Went here for a quick lunch the service was very good the booths comfortable even for a big guy. the food was good but I consider it average for this type of restaurant.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-03-11T05:52:44-0500", "location_id": "2630632", "id": "354555964", "user": {"username": "Mike S", "user_location": {"name": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "id": "34094"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Worth a try...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34094-d2630632-r350835128-m11068-Carolina_Ale_House-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html#review350835128", "text": "Went there for dinner.
