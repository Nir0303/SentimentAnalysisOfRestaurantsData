When we got our food, I was just slightly disappointed as my hash browns and eggs were just Luke warm. But I was so hungry that I just went ahead and ate instead of sending it back. Alway tasty though. So not a huge issue. But what pleased me the most was the service. Our waitress was Erika and the only way she could have been more attentive is if she pulled our car around and wheeled us out to the awaiting vehicle. She truly was awesome! Over the top friendly, great suggestions and even offered me a \"to go\" cup of their specialty coffee. I wanted to adopt her! The host, sorry but I didn't catch his name, was also extremely friendly to the point that I asked my wife if she knew him. Of course, we will return....It's Weck's!
