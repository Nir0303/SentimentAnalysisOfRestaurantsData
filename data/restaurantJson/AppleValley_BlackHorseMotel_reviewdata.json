I generally have good luck with the modestly priced establishments- primarily because I am not looking for nor willing to pay for 400 thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets, pillow-top mattresses and fancy flat-screen TV's. Not that you could hope to find that in the high desert at all. \nAnyway, I'm going to cut to the chase. The rooms ARE NOT AIR CONDITIONED! Yes, they have \"swamp coolers\"... which DO NOT WORK DURING THE SUPER-HUMID MONSOON SEASON!! Swampers work by flowing water over filters which then evaporates and the thus- cooled air is blown in by (noisy) fan. They work pretty good when the humidity is low, but during the July thru September Monsoon season are, at best, minimally effective. The end result is that you feel sticky and hot. Bottom line: NOT ACCEPTABLE. \nThe rest of the room is just, well, OLD. Curtains consist of hemmed bedsheets. Mattress firm and not real comfortable. Bedspread and carpet acceptably clean but worn. WiFi worked with my Mac Book Pro but my iPhone 4s  (which I know needs a stronger signal) would not connect. Beware re \"non-smoking \" rooms. Mine was non-smoking yet had definitely been smoked in -ALOT. Think about it: Do you think they are gonna be truthful about this- and let $50 or more fly away to another establishment.\nAhh well, you get what you pay for, right? Well in Apple Valley- not so much. It's too close to LA. \nBottom Line? : For about $5-10 extra per night you can get a much better room. I paid $105 for two nights- and that was with my \"contractor discount\". I would have to say that this is, no doubt, the cheapest motel in town. It might be OK in the winter as it has a newer-looking Williams wall heater. But forget it for the summer. \nBTW, yep I BARBECUED this place. If the rooms were cheaper- and they HAD BEEN UP-FRONT ABOUT THE LACK OF AC, well ummm this is 2012.

Due to uncontrollable, last-minute changes in medical and caregiver schedules of family we were visiting in Lucerne Valley, my sister was unable to cancel our reservation less than 48 hours prior to check in. The Black Horse management is not flexible or accommodating re: cancellation. There was no negotiating, like paying for one night and getting refund for the second night. Credit card payment was upfront for both nights on the website.  \nI wonder what room was photographed for the website. It definitely wasn\u2019t Room 21. This is the room that I review.\nThe front desk man on duty (March 22) was not friendly. He questioned me as to why I was asking for two additional sets of towels. That was a first! The main source of heat is a wall-heater and the pilot light was off. Cold air from the high-desert night leaked through the top & bottom of door so my sister stuffed her comforter in the gaping cracks and for the 2nd night we borrowed a blanket from our aunt. A round table was pushed into a dark corner of main room with no lighting for reading, visiting with my sister. When we checked in, another guest\u2019s fishing pole, crutches, and soiled clothing were inside the closet. The dead bolt was broken. The 'guy' was so surly that we chose not to 'bother' him w/maintenance issues. We asked for another room and our request was denied.\nThe carpet & furniture was soiled and in need of repair or replacement; broken bathroom mirror; unwashed & dirty film on windows; refrigerator and microwave unplugged; stove pilot light was off; kitchen tiles chipped; dirty tin foil under stove grates; scratchy blankets; rough & scratchy towels; thin sheets; major air leakage at top and bottom of door; small, non-lighted tiled shower with peeling non-skid strips. The 'double' room was indeed one double bed and one twin bed pushed against the wall directly under the window. This was not stated on website. The wooden bed frames were permanent and immovable. Coffee was not available--the man at front desk stated that since the room was only $50.00 per night that coffee was not offered. \nI highly recommend NOT staying at Black Horse Motel, at least not in Room 21, unless cleanliness and security are not an issue. \nDuring past travels, I have located older, cleaner and decent lodging for $60 and under. My expectation is always the same, that the room & bedding are clean and doors/windows are secure, that management is pleasant and accommodating. Not so during our 2-night stay. Truly, there are NO redeeming qualities re: the room for me to be positive about. The high desert sunrise was magnificent. Our first impression of the room was not that of charming or quaint --more like broken down, dilapidated, uncared for, unsecure. With no refund available, my sister and I stayed. \n\nStayed March 2010\n(aka khandra)", "helpful_votes": "4", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2012-07-04T11:27:32-0400", "location_id": "1222990", "id": "133457615", "user": {"username": "pegina16", "user_location": {"name": "Miller, Indiana", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2012-03", "title": "WHAT A DUMP!!!YOU NEED A FULL BODY CONDOM!!!

When begging for the extra towels, I asked if coffee was available in the morning, and the man stated that since the room was only $50.00 per night that coffee was not offered. \nI highly suggest NOT staying at Black Horse Motel unless you like flushing money down the toilet. In the past I have located older, cleaner and decent motels for $60 and under. Not this one. Truly, there are NO redeeming qualities about the Black Horse. It is not charming or quaint. Adjectives that come to mind are dirty, dark, derelict, deteriorated, despicable, dingy, depressing, disgusting, deplorable.", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2010-04-05T08:48:08-0400", "location_id": "1222990", "id": "60432891", "user": {"username": "khandra", "user_location": {"name": "Miller, Indiana", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2010-03", "title": "Never never never stay here", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29101-d1222990-r59844233-m11068-Black_Horse_Motel-Apple_Valley_California.html#review59844233", "text": "Wow, what a dump.

I was unbelievably mortified when I saw the inside. I know what your thinking if it was that bad why did you stay there...well my boyfriend picked it and had already paid. So we were stuck because these people dnt even give you a refund even if you just paid and are unsatisfied with the condition of the room. When you walk in the smell alone is enough to make you want to leave. We tried to champ it out even with how disgusting the stains were on the bed, carpet, ect. Anyway we couldn't help feeling like we were about to be the plot of a bad horror movie so we left and paid for a room somewhere else. Please do not believe any positive reviews on this place for I believe they were all written by managment/owners.
