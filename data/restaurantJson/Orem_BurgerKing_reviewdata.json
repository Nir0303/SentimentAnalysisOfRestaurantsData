Ordered it with fries and a coke. The order took over 7 minutes. The burger was so cold the cheese wasn't even melted. I took it back to the counter and asked for a hot burger. The counter person gave me an unfriendly scowl, tossed it in the wastebasket and hollered to someone in back that they needed a double cheese burger. Didn't apologize or say anything to ME. After waiting another 3 minutes, the counter person hollered out to the dining area, \"double cheese burger!\" I guess I thought the polite thing to do would be to bring it to my table, but I guess I was expecting too much. The second burger was just as cold, with no melted cheese. I was not about to go through all of that again. (I know, I should have). I gagged it down and left.
