Excellent wraps, pretty sizable for Mediterranean style and the falafel were some of the best we have tasted.  We found our new go-to for shwarma wraps!

The bread like pita and lavash is baked fresh and makes a big difference. I like the falafel and typically order that or the shawarma . The owner and his staff go the extra mile to take care of customers and that means a lot. I will say my only negative would be putting lettuce in my falafel pita which is a no no.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-12T22:37:22-0500", "location_id": "9869170", "id": "354929927", "user": {"username": "Sierra N", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-03", "title": "A new place for baklava!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32956-d9869170-r354886809-m11068-Zadna_Restaurant-Redwood_City_California.html#review354886809", "text": "My son and I visited for a Saturday afternoon meal - very fun and interesting menu.
