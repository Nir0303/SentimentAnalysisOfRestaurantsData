The shrimp was a little on the fresh side, but the soft, buttery rice made up for it. The side dishes were very enjoyable as well.

This restaurant is also one of the few restaurants in Texas with actually great sweet. As a southern girl, this spoke volumes to me. You can dine in or order your food for take out.

We ordered  the garlic fried and yaki mandu. and along with it , 8 sides of vegetables each in a separate  bowls, including the Kimchee. The food was some of the best I have ever had.  The cook, waitresses, and staff  were all Korean and all very friendly and provided great service.   If I lived here, I would visited this restaurant once  a week.\n..  .", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-02-24T09:01:16-0500", "location_id": "4650742", "id": "195231742", "user": {"username": "JimCopel", "user_location": {"name": "Mobile, Alabama", "id": "30709"}}}]}
