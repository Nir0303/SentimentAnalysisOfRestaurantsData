I have to agree with another reviewer that the fact that Freakin' Unbelievable and Street Craves are the same place is odd and confusing, but it is what it is. The front of the restaurant says Street Craves, and the back entrance says Freakin' Unbelievable. Parking is difficult - there is a $5 cash lot behind the restaurant or street parking if you're lucky enough to find something. \nAll that aside - the food is definitely worth the hassle. I had the Ancho BBQ burger and sweet potato fries. The ancho bbq sauce was a great pairing with angus beef, cheese, and bacon. The buns were light and fluffy and added the right mix of flavor and texture to the burger. The sweet potato fries were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar bringing in a whole new flavor profile to the meal. It all worked in the most unexpected way! Pair that with a cold beer or soda and you have yourself a meal. \nIf parking wasn't such an issue, I would make this a regular spot to visit while in Lexington.\nBe sure to take the time to try this restaurant out.

This place sucks..plain and simple it sucks.\nThis joint replaced HUGH JASS Burgers on the corner of S. Limestone and Avenue of Champions near the University of Kentucky campus. Here is the break down: Front side of the joint serves up something they call \"street taco's\" (which in Kentucky could be an eyebrow raiser) if you want a burger they prefer you go the back of the place off of Jersey Street. You \"can\" order either or but they stressed it more than once that burgers were in the back..I don't know why but I found that kind of ridiculous. You may sit wherever you like, so what the  blankety blank does it matter where specifically I place my order? The menu is not all that different than any other novelty burger place, rather taco, rather..ahh whatever. The items are pricey, and the service was super slow. The food was crap. The fries were too hot, too hot, and way too crunchy. The burger was damn near 9 bucks, and I could have gotten a better burger at a Frisch's  Big Boy! I spent 22 minutes of my thirty minute lunch waiting on my food and could not have been more disappointed honestly. I truly hate to be so negative, but this place is not worth wasting your money. It was awful, and I will never again go back. RIP OFF!!!!!
