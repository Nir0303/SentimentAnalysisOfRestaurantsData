We\u2019d like to point out that the gentleman and his group were offered a refund and/or complimentary foursome.  He received the refund immediately along with our sincerest apologies.  The complimentary round of golf is still available and, as the owner, I would like to buy the gentleman and his golf guests lunch and a round of drinks. Please contact kgrimmer@vantagehopsitality.com and we\u2019d be more than happy to accommodate you and your golf guests. \r\n\r\nBernie Moyle, Owner\r\nBill Friesing, General Manager", "title": "Owner Response", "published_date": "2014-02-25T06:07:53-0500", "id": "195329420"}, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-02-22T17:11:55-0500", "location_id": "3870986", "id": "195024788", "user": {"username": "Keith D", "user_location": {"name": "Lake Orion, Michigan", "id": "42384"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-01", "title": "Ladies Day", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34153-d3870986-r192272608-m11068-The_Country_Club_of_Coral_Springs-Coral_Springs_Broward_County_Florida.html#review192272608", "text": "Enjoyable round of golf.

Beginning with the bag staff and continuing with the pro shop and cart girl everyone could not have been nicer. The fairways and rough were in very good shape and the greens were in excellent shape, Probably the best greens I have played in the past six months. Lastly no two holes are alike and its one of the best laid out tracks in So. Fl. With a 10:00 am tee time we were expecting the typical  5 hour round. We finished in 4:20.  Our experience was worth sharing and we will definitely become regulars at this course.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-01-23T09:42:20-0500", "location_id": "3870986", "id": "191825895", "user": {"username": "R Peter S", "user_location": {"name": "Tamarac, Florida", "id": "34677"}}}]}
