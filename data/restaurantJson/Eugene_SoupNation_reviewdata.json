Soup Nation is a very small, cute restaurant which sells a great variety of soups.  It was a very cold day, so we had the 3-soup special which comes in individual bowls and homemade bread.  Our main complaints were that the soups were not hot enough and needed more seasoning.  But the good thing is that they have a great variety of different types of soups, and if they can adjust the heat and seasoning, then I would rate them Excellent.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-01-23T09:11:11-0500", "location_id": "2653986", "id": "250666128", "user": {"username": "Foodismyvice", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Good healthy soups.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51862-d2653986-r243929779-m11068-Soup_Nation-Eugene_Oregon.html#review243929779", "text": "They make healthy and tasty soups.
