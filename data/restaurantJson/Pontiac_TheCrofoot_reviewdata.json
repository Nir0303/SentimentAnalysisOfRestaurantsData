We waited outside before doors opened among a friendly crowd.\n\nThey have different bands just about every night, so you'll want to look ahead.  They have everything from international groups (Caravan Palace, the Buzzcocks) to local bands.\n\nInside, it's a simple but intimate venue.  We had the sense that someone had taken pride both in restoring whatever the original venue was and also maintaining it to a high standard.  The sound system was excellent. Bathrooms were clean and modern.\n\nWe stood towards the front, but there was also what appeared to be excellent room in the balcony, which runs along the side.  The crowds both nights we came here were just there to enjoy themselves - everyone seemed to respect everyone else and to have a good time.\n\nThe staff was professional and pleasant.  We were able to get Bell's Two-Hearted Ale in bottles, so we were pretty happy, but there were many other kinds of beer and other drinks available.\n\nOne note:  Pontiac is more or less in transition.  It felt very safe due to the crowds and wide spaces (as well as the presence of security), but, politely, you might want to make sure your valuables are locked securely in the trunk or don't bring them at all.  There is parking across the street.  You need to pay $5 into a machine to park (actually, it gives you until 6:00 a.m. the next morning).  Apparently they will tow your car although the night we were there they just asked to see your receipt upon exit (we saw $5 change hands a lot).\n\nCrofoot was perfect for an act like Caravan Palace - basically the whole place was dancing and jumping with the music and the energy level was about as high as it gets.\n\nThe Crofoot is a good place to enjoy original acts in a venue where you are no more than maybe 50 feet from the stage.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-21T16:44:13-0400", "location_id": "2650964", "id": "384742676", "user": {"username": "ElaineAndGreg", "user_location": {"name": "Chesterland, Ohio", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Welcoming and comfortable", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42604-d2650964-r366626873-m11068-The_Crofoot-Pontiac_Michigan.html#review366626873", "text": "Have been to the Crofoot many times over the past several years and always enjoy coming here.
