I find it an immensely satisfying experience and so different than other tea/coffee places with loud music and loud talking. There's a time for that kind of ambience, but at Dream About Tea, you know you can sit quietly, have a conversation, read, listen to classical music.  The loose tea selection is large and unique. The owner, Daquan, is lovely and will help you to find a tea that you will enjoy. There are light food choices; including some Chinese pastries, like lotus and red bean cakes.  You will never be hurried or rushed and will be greeted as a friend when you return.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-28T06:46:34-0400", "location_id": "4640647", "id": "207538847", "user": {"username": "Vicki15", "user_location": {"name": "Evanston, IL", "id": null}}}]}
