So funny! Top line up comedy and make sure to sign up for free tickets on their website. If you go a weekend that they haven't emailed you free tickets just print the buy one get one free ticket on their web page. Get there early cause it's first come first seating in the showroom. Do upgrade to preferred seating cause they sit that line first. Two drink min order per person in the showroom and they add a surcharge so don't feel pressured to tip. Drinks can be as high as $10 each in the showroom. But they have cool names, some light up with neat light things in them and usually strong.\nAfter the comedy show there is karaoke in the karaoke bar. This is a MUST! Bernard (the host) is HILARIOUS!!! You can watch or get up and sing you fave song! The worse you are the better! Everyone is here for a good time! The bar in the karaoke area is great and there is even a shot girl making rounds. Drinks aren't too high ei... $5.50 mixed drinks and $3 shots. Most prices downtown Fort Worth are higher than that. \nThis place is a must visit for couples or singles ready for a night out on the town!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-04-13T15:27:47-0400", "location_id": "3397757", "id": "157641349", "user": {"username": "bovine27", "user_location": {"name": "Texas", "id": null}}}]}
