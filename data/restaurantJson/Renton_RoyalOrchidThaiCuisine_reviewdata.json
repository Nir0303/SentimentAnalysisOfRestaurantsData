One of the dishes was 0 stars spicy the other 2 stars. I wanted to judge their level of spicy.  On the 2 star spicy dish I ordered extra meat. I wanted to judge the level of meat given between a regular order and extra meat. I was of course charged more for this.\n\nHere is what I experienced. The noodles were stuck together like a brick on the bottom and loose on the top. I utilize chopsticks avidly, when you can pick up the whole dish...there's a problem.\n\n I started with the spicy 2 star dish with extra meat. I was delighted to see a double portion of meat. although the noodles were like a brick I continued to search the flavor. Unfortunately not spicy at all. The dish was less spicy than expected almost blandly spiced.\n\nI moved on to the dish with 0 stars their original prep. I was displeased as I only had 3 pieces of chicken in the dish the size of a 50 cent piece. This dish made me feel like either both dishes were prepared at once and no thought given to the order. Or the extra meat I paid for some how transitioned to the chicken owed me taken at a loss because hardly any meat was in my original dish. If they prepare the most basic Thai dish like this what does that say for the more complex dishes?\n\nI understand people love this restaurant, that's your right. But from someone that has tasted quality thai food with careful prep this place falls short. I will never eat here again. My only other regrets are I tipped so heavily in my excitement and spent $50 for this experience.\n\nAlso while the crab delight had a great taste, I highly suspect krab.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-08-19T18:55:26-0400", "location_id": "463964", "id": "407696117", "user": {"username": "Andy P", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "tasty food but messed up my take out order", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58704-d463964-r403018497-m11068-Royal_Orchid_Thai_Cuisine-Renton_Washington.html#review403018497", "text": "but the food we did get was very yummy.   so yeah, they forgot my rice.  funny thing, they had called the hotel to see if I was up to paying the extra $2...

I ordered hot and sour soup with I order at any Asian restaurant where I can find it. This was more flavorful than any I've ever had; I asked him about the chili in it and he said they use Thai chili. It was packed with the all natural ingredients and I chose chicken and there were nice thin slices of real chicken in it. I then ordered the Sweet and Sour dish and again chose chicken. I was VERY pleasantly surprised by two things: a)he askd me to choose on a scale of one to four the hotness (I chose medium, I am in town to do my comic ventriloquism show in a school and can't chance a....\"disruption\"...should I say). I LOVE hot but I needed medium. b)when I asked for rice he asked \"White rice or brown rice\"?\" not a question I get at most Asian restaurants (I chose brown). And what can I say about the main dish except again it was UTTERLY SUPERB: big, chunks of real vegetables (including pineapple) in the best sauce ever, with fresh chicken and great rice. I asked for a Thai iced tea. At some places you get what seems like a mix. This was 100 percent home made. And that's the \"motif\" of this restaurant, great food made with great care and great ingredients. This is not a super cheap restaurant but it's not super expensive. I LOVED THIS PLACE and since it's only the past three months that I've gotten into Thai food this makes me want to go to more Thai restaurants. But I suspect they are NOT as good as this one. A treasure for Renton ...and all who visit!!!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-01-19T18:44:51-0500", "location_id": "463964", "id": "250107996", "user": {"username": "Joe G", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Great Lunch out or in", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58704-d463964-r242545315-m11068-Royal_Orchid_Thai_Cuisine-Renton_Washington.html#review242545315", "text": "The food is great, service is always there with a smile, price is reasonable for both lunch and supper... and they have a cool fish tank population :o)  Love their wide ride noodle dishes and the vegetable delight!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-12-02T11:28:55-0500", "location_id": "463964", "id": "242545315", "user": {"username": "Jack W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-11", "title": "Exquisite", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58704-d463964-r239566635-m11068-Royal_Orchid_Thai_Cuisine-Renton_Washington.html#review239566635", "text": "I don't use that word very often.  I was pleasantly surprised by the crab delight purses.  The wonton wrapper had tiny bubbles and was so crispy.  Heaven!  If you are a crab rangoon connoisseur ..... you have found perfection.  The drunken noodles were BETTER than a place I used to go to that closed.  I feel like I've hit the mother-load!  The noodles were wide and held the spice of that 3/4 star order.  It wasn't overloaded with onion or pepper .... just the right balance.  The chicken was fresh and you could taste it.  I did everything but lick the plate.  The aspect that sealed the deal (of my new favorite place) and will have me coming back (and telling friends) was the WAY that the ENTIRE staff treated me.  I felt welcome, respect, caring, efficiency and honesty ... all in one service experience.  That is talent.  I have since returned with my small daughter and I'm pretty sure they seated us by the fish tank because the ARE just THAT talented.
