They have a huge menu that contains Greek and American choices.  They have typical Greek items like souvlaki and gyros, as well as some nontraditional items like lamb shank which is very good.    Prices run about $4 to $8 for a meal with large portions.  It is hard to leave this place hungry.  It is good for groups because everyone will find something they like.  We have also used their catering for work parties and they have a very reasonably priced catering menu.
