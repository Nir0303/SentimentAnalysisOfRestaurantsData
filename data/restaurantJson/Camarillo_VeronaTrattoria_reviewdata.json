Had a hard time time deciding where to go in Camarillo because there just isn't a whole lot of choices although downtown Camarillo has a few choices. I wish I had decided to go elsewhere. My son and I walked in to the restaurant and it was empty save for a table of four older ladies at almost 6:00pm. We sat where we wanted to and were quickly given menus and our candle was lit. I ordered a glass of wine, my son ordered water and told the waiter we would be a little longer deciding on our entrees. The waiter came back almost ten minutes later to take our orders but neglected to bring our drinks. I had to ask for them to be brought. I ordered the Osso Bucco and my son ordered the chicken piccata. The wine was a good price for the dinner hour, but the entrees, Oy! The time it took to finally get our entrees I thought was way too long. About half an hour. While we were waiting for our food I had a chance to watch the people at the bar. They appeared to be the family of the waitress or owner. One was drinking wine, the waitress was eating and her son was running around the bar area, sometimes in a loud voice! Totally inappropriate! The Osso Bucco was way over salted and did not taste as if it was made fresh that day. The sauce was thick and burned tasting. No pride in the cooking as far as I am concerned. Would not go there again as there just doesn't seem like there is any professionalism in running the place relative to the food or family members present. The waitress even came to the table with the phone cradled on her shoulder talking to someone. My advice is to watch a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmare's with Gordon Ramsey to see why your customers are not coming back. Send your family members home, make your food fresh and make your customers want to return to a restaurant that looks so nice on the outside but does not follow thru on its service or taste.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-12-05T11:24:19-0500", "location_id": "521598", "id": "146839454", "user": {"username": "d c", "user_location": {"name": "san diego", "id": null}}}]}
