All our group of 16 went for dinner and a few drinks, everyone loved the food. I had to st louis ribs and they were fantastic, would recommend half portion which was more than enough for me. The waitors could not have done more for our group and were super friendly. The interior was kind of rustic with a really chilled out vibe. Dress code would be casual. Delighted we ate here on our 1 night stay in Scottsdale.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-07-21T12:37:35-0400", "location_id": "8645847", "id": "395222828", "user": {"username": "NadineJones89", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Awesome Dive-Bar with an amazing atmosphere", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31350-d8645847-r382218562-m11068-Patties-Scottsdale_Arizona.html#review382218562", "text": "The perfect places to enjoy a few cool-ones with your buddies or colleagues. Not only is this an exceptionally charming bar, they have really-really good beers, ales & stouts.

There's games such as Ping-Pong, Pool, Darts & some others. \n\nThe bartenders & staff are super friendly and quick to service. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a nice beer. \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-13T09:21:44-0400", "location_id": "8645847", "id": "382218562", "user": {"username": "bunked", "user_location": {"name": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "id": "186394"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Local dive", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31350-d8645847-r346992321-m11068-Patties-Scottsdale_Arizona.html#review346992321", "text": "This bar was recommended by a waiter, so we popped in there after our meal not sure what to expect.
