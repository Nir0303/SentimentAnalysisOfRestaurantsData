After reading some mixed reviews online,we decided to try it for ourselves and glad we did. It was super busy (a good sign) around 8 PM with people picking up pizzas. Freshly baked large pizza was hot and the crust was crisp. It was pepperoni so a bit greasy as you would expect. Yum! \nDining area was dirty (floor), but there was constant flow of customers eating non stop.
