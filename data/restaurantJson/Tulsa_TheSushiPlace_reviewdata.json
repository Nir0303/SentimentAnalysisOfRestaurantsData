My aunt is a huge fan of The Sushi Place and has told me to go so many times. Since it was just a block down from the BOK Center, we decided to give it a shot. We went in right about 6 or so and were able to get the last table without having to wait. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is tiny. There were maybe a dozen tables total, and even most of those only sat two people. The restaurant was very busy and it was obvious that the wait staff were overwhelmed. It took our server a little while to even get over to us to give us a menu. It was an even longer wait to get a drink and place an order. \n\nWe decided to try the 918 Crunch Roll, Naughty Roll, and Volcano Roll. The food was also pretty slow getting to us. Once we were served, our food was very good. I wouldn't say this is the best sushi I have ever had, but it is definitely some of the better sushi I have had in Tulsa. I would rank it #2 or #3. By far, the best roll was the Naughty Roll. It just was excellent. The 918 Crunch Roll was also very good. The Volcano Roll was a little more on the lacking side. Some pieces were incredibly spicy, and some had very little flavor. It just wasn't very consistent. \n\nWhen we were finished, we waited for a LONG time for a check. It seemed at this point that the restaurant was down to only a single server (there were only two to begin with) and he was absolutely swamped. We eventually walked up to the counter to get a check so we could pay and get to our concert. I don't know if this is normal or not, but there definitely needs to be more staff out working the floor. The food was really good and I would have easily given this place a 5 star rating had it not been for the lacking service. I think a rating of 3 1/2 stars seems about right, but since I can't give half stars, I will round it up to four.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-09-05T17:03:01-0400", "location_id": "2607673", "id": "415154619", "user": {"username": "Steve R", "user_location": {"name": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "id": "51697"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Quaint Enviroment with Great Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d2607673-r406556389-m11068-The_Sushi_Place-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review406556389", "text": "I enjoyed my experience thoroughly.

The coupon included two salads, two bowls of Miso soup, edamame, a 918 roll and two entrees off of a special \u201cLiving Social\u201d menu.  \n\nWhile we were looking at the menu, the chef/owner brought us a small plate of an appetizer she\u2019d created to get our opinions (as well as several other diners).  It was an avocado/wasabi combination topped with small bites of fried chicken and some type of \u201ccrunchies\u201d.  It was actually the best thing we ate all night!\n\nOur server began our meal by bringing our soups and salads out together.  Before we were even half way through that she brought out the edamame.  The soup was pretty much tasteless and luke warm, the salad was okay although very hard to eat with chopsticks (only utensils we were given to eat with) and it needed more dressing; it also was topped with the \u201ccrunchies\u201d.   The edamame was luke warm and lacked flavor as well.  \n\nOur server then brought out our entrees which included another salad, a cup of rice, a small fried chicken piece and a bowl of sauce (I had teriyaki and my husband had curry).  The teriyaki sauce was thin and tasted a lot like the miso soup did.  The curry had some bite, but it was very thin as well and except for the bite didn\u2019t have any flavor.  We were told that we were supposed to add the chicken into the rice portion of our bento box and then pour the sauce over it.  By the time we did that, our rice was floating and again it became almost impossible to eat with chopsticks.\nThe 918 roll was brought to the table at the same time as the entrees and it was okay but nothing really special but it was rolled in the same \u201ccrunchies\u201d as the salad and small plate.  The soy sauce completely overpowered the taste of the roll which was disappointing; I was really looking forward to a good sushi roll.\n\nKeep in mind that our food was being served with rapid fire precision and our plates were not being removed as we finished one course and began another.  We were sitting at a table for two and by the time we were finished the table was covered with dishes (pet peeve of mine).\n\nThe restaurant is located downtown and parking was not convenient.  It is a very small place with seating for about 40 and with the extremely high ceilings it became quite noisy and there were only about 10 people eating dinner, so definitely not someplace to be able to sit and chat comfortably with your dinner companions if there are other diners there.\n\nAll in all, the meal we had would have cost us well over $60.00 without the Living Social coupon and we can spend that amount or less and have a much better meal at another restaurant.  My husband normally gets sake and a beer with his sushi; however, last night he had water because the sake/beer combo would have cost us around $20.00.  Bottom line, save your money and go somewhere else if you\u2019re dining downtown and/or craving sushi.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-21T08:29:46-0400", "location_id": "2607673", "id": "301860274", "user": {"username": "Sunshine7643", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "So so...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d2607673-r289302782-m11068-The_Sushi_Place-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review289302782", "text": "Hmmm...

The atmosphere was pleasant and warm. The sushi was good and the service fast. \n\nPros: Delicious rolls. I also enjoyed the fact that there weren't a 100 rolls on the menu. Sake- I can't remember what it was called, but it tasted a lot like a sweet cider. I enjoy a good sake and the server let me sample some before I bought the bottle. They have a really good selection of different sakes. 918 crunchy roll- AMAZING! And on Tuesdays it is $3/roll. \n\nCons: Volcano Roll, not a big fan of it, but it wasn't horrible.
