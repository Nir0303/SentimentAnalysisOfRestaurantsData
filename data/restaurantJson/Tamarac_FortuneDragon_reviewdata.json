As soon as I walked in, I wanted to walk out! But I couldnt as 1 of my friends drove quite a distance & I didnt want to upset the apple cart. Anyway, the decor is appalling, dark, dingy, the carpet looked 30 yrs old with all that entails! The chairs are  VERY uncomfortable, the walls & doors to kitchen were dirty. (I guess they never heard of paint) There were sodas & drinks stacked in the last booth & along the corridor to bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom that left a lot to be desired too. Cleaning products were left in the open, the faucets were well beyond what anyone could do to make them shine/look clean. It was a functional bathroom. It just gives an icky feeling like the rest of the building. Also the walls needed painting in there & the corridor as well.  As far as the food goes it was fine, nothing to rave about but the prices were reasonable with generous portions. Wait staff was friendly, but I ordered first & my meal came out last..she apologized tho. I didnt like the way she set the table, she practically slammed the utensils down on the napkin..unprofessional. Furthermore she did not give us her name. \nIf they spruce up the place, & get storage solutions for all those drinks, it would a much more appealing restaurant to visit.  I dont understand why no other reviewer didnt mention how terrible this place looks. Not going back anytime soon.

I've never waited more than 15 minutes for my order, which is always piping hot.  One thing that was different was that when I ordered sweet and sour chicken, and my wife ordered honey chicken, was that they gave us the tempura-battered chicken with no sauces on it.  Both sauces were in their own separate containers.  My wife liked that, because it allowed us to have a slightly larger or smaller portion than we would have normally.  I asked my 10 year old how his lo mein was, and he gave a \"Grmmff\" with two thumbs up, so I'm assuming he was saying it was good.  The gentleman at the counter is always friendly and cheerful, and by my third visit to order take-out, was talking to me like an old friend, discussing 80's cartoons, upcoming movies, favorite books, etc.  My dinner combo (sweet and sour chicken, pork-fried rice, egg roll, and soup) always comes to around $8, and lasts me for two meals.
