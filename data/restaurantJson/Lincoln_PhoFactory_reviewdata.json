Don't be put off by the \"Factory\" name, this place has some delicious, authentic food. I come for the pho, as it is one of the very few places in Nebraska that I have found that offer tendon and tripe in their pho (along with brisket, fatty brisket, rare steak, flank, and meatball). The pho comes with a mountain of sprouts, cilantro, basil, peppers, and a lime wedge (these items should be standard at most pho places, but I find that sprouts, cilantro, and lemon are only typically offered around these parts). You can choose between a small (which is fairly large on its own), medium, large, or \"Challenge\" size bowls. The broth is not the meatiest or brownest I've had; it is slightly more subtle flavored, but I prefer my pho that way. If pho isn't your thing, there are a ton of other Vietnamese dishes on the menu that are fantastic.\n\nThe interior is clean and rather upscale (granite tabletops and tv's at the front of the restaurant) and I've never had a problem with service. All in all, I can get a great meal of fresh spring rolls and pho for under $15 plus tax and tip.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-08-05T09:43:15-0400", "location_id": "4824149", "id": "219790352", "user": {"username": "pumilionis", "user_location": {"name": "Omaha, Nebraska", "id": "60885"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-07", "title": "Great place, may be in top 5 in Lincoln", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45667-d4824149-r216090905-m11068-Pho_Factory-Lincoln_Nebraska.html#review216090905", "text": "Excellent cooking, clean, very delicious.
