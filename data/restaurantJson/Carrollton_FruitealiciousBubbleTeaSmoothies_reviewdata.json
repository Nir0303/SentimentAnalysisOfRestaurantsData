Yes, I love smoothies. There it was, right in front of me, an opportunity to buy a Groupon for a smoothie place...and easy to find. It just wasn't for me. I got the strawberry and banana smoothie, and it took me too hours to finish off the drink. I couldn't decide whether I just didn't like it, or whether the too-much-banana taste was the problem. It also had bits of strawberry in it, which would have been wonderful; but somehow the only think strawberry about it was the color. My daughter got a smoothie drink with bubbles in it. I swear the bubbles inundated the drink, and the bubbles were only put in because with our two large smoothies, there was money left over on the Groupon to buy three bubbles. No Thanks!!! This place just didn't do it for me.

Fruitealicious is like the best ever. They have such a wide span of drink choices that you can never go wrong with. All the employees are so kind & courteous & very helpful in helping you narrow down your selection. I can never say that I've ever had a bad drink from there. The place is a really awesome place to go hangout with friends or to go study at. They have free wifi, an assortment of magazines to read, & also a ton of board games to play with as well. I'm constantly going there & always trying out a new flavor or combination assortment. Make sure you join the Fruitealicious Rewards Program you'll obtain great benefits from it.
