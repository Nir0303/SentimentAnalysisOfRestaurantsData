The restaurant emphasises its authentic Italian menu and ingredients. The atmosphere was enlivened by the open cooking area which allowed diners to watch the chefs at work. Our server, Nataly, was very helpful and offered useful advice about menu choices.\nWe ordered the olives, which offered a generous selection flavoured with Mediterranean herbs, and the mixed salad. The salad was quite small with very thinly sliced carrots and squash served in a good vinaigrette dressing. The sauvignon blanc was a great wine to accompany these dishes.\nWe then shared a pizza, which was about 12\" in diameter and sufficient for 2 of us. The pizza was cooked at a very high temperature (900*) for a short time so the dough remains soft and easy to cut. The toppings we chose blended very well giving an authentic Italian taste and resulted in a divine pizza!! We decided to have an Anchor beer with the pizza which was cold, crisp and slightly hoppy which made it ideal. \nWe shared a Tiramisu for dessert; after all what else would be really authentic? It was rich, creamy and very moreish - highly recommended. The decaf espresso we had with dessert was very strong but very good.\nAs a nightcap I chose a Peruvian brandy which I'd never seen before. It was clear, rather than the amber colour of French or Spanish brandy. It had the taste of brandy but without the woody overtones of a conventional brandy. A very interesting drink!\nThis meal was like eating in a very good local restaurant in an Italian city, but in the heart of the Napa valley.

I have lived in Napa for 5 years and frequented the Enoteca at Oxbow Market and now the restaurant on First Street 4-5 times.  The food is excellent and I always try something new and I am always so impressed. The service is impeccable, friendly, helpful, (especially since I cant pronounce anything on the menu!) and I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  My favorite dish is the roasted vegetables as a starter. They serve with plenty of bread and every time I have this dish it is roasted perfectly. The bread is their pizza dough and its surprising light but just chewy enough.  One time we had a small group and they brought us a complimentary dessert of fried pizza dough remnants drizzled with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was SO good! \n\nLately the bar has been packed and they make excellent cocktails and have great bartenders.  I love and appreciate most when a restaurant has consistency and every time I go there I am consistently impressed and happy with my food and service.  They have a late night music scene now that is very popular so if your looking for something to do late night this is the place.. They have some awesome talent coming thru there! Not your average \"bar type singer songwriter with the John Mayer sound\" that everyone else seems to have all the time. \n\nOne more thing to add. I had a chance to sample most of their wines recently at another event and I was VERY surprised how good they all were.  Not one in the line up was a disappointment and for the price its the best value in Napa quite possibly. The prosecco was crisp and just a slight sugar on tongue but not like most. The pinot is bright fruit and perfectly balanced for a pinot and I can be picky on pinots. The cab and chardonnay are both clear winners and normally I would be hesitant to order the house wine but not here! \n\nIf your looking for a perfect dining experience in Napa this is the place.. And best part is it feels like a small run restaurant where the owners are directly involved and really are committed to providing an authentic Italian experience.

The happy hour deals for drinks and \"bites\" were good, but the real food (i.e. plates for dinner) was subpar. \n\nThe bartenders were awesome, super friendly, and helpful with our drink orders, so let me give them all of the credit they deserve for their fantastic work. The cocktails are delicious. Definitely get one of the wine cocktails like the La Morosa.\n\nThe pizza was nothing special. For a restaurant that has brick, wood-fired ovens, the pizza is undercooked and you miss out on the crispy, smokiness that wood fires usually provide. We expected better, given the nice atmosphere and the aroma.

Don't know what region of Italy, but food was old world simple flavors with nice presentation.  Wine selection via iPad which made ordering much easier than trying to peruse a printed menu. Bar looked to be well stocked with a wide variety of spirits some from local distilleries.\n\nIf you have read any of my previous reviews, you will note that service and attention to detail are important. With today's roaming chef's capitalizing on bringing novel culinary takes to the masses with food trucks, I have found that the dining experience has to be judged on not only taste and presentation, but service as well.  Our experience at Ca Momi was made unique by the efforts of our server Daoud.  We defaulted to his suggestions and were overjoyed with the selections.  His attention to detail was incredible.  His personality was engaging, thoughtful, and non- assuming.  Could not have been happier with his service.\n\nOur overall rating for the restaurant was a four but his service a 5!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-05T17:33:16-0400", "location_id": "9455096", "id": "401892341", "user": {"username": "drewster63", "user_location": {"name": "silicon valley", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Great food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d9455096-r401548259-m11068-Ca_Momi_Osteria-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html#review401548259", "text": "Great salads, pizza, bur atta and veggies.
