The homemade crust and the homemade sauce combined with the ingredients on it was so good! WOW truly impressed to have found an Italian place in Oregon and so grateful that our friends from here recommended it.  The pizza was perfectly cooked and hit the spot.   \n\nThe Giovanni special house salad with home made dressing is really good I'd recommend it.  \n\nDefinitely 5 stars", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2015-10-05T17:34:10-0400", "location_id": "445854", "id": "316444231", "user": {"username": "Makena808", "user_location": {"name": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "id": "60982"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-04", "title": "Microwaved Meatballs and pizz poor pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51765-d445854-r307536980-m11068-Giovanni_s_Restaurant-Beaverton_Oregon.html#review307536980", "text": "Have tried this place twice over the years at the request of my kids.
