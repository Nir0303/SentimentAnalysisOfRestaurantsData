But we did have to push our waiter along a little he was a little slow. Service was ok . I had the Papadella with pink sauce and a meatball it was great they make there own pasta and the meatball was huge . Took half home . My husband had the chicken parm and he really liked it and he also had leftovers . We started out with calamari it had an Asian flavor that would have been fine but not for an Italian restaurant . I can't wait to go back  and have the time to not have to rush the place is so charming . You feel so at home there. You will not be disappointed.

It was nice to be in an Italian restaurant that uses garlic as a compliment to taste rather than relying on it. We had the hot peppers in oil (fresh and hot!), calamari in a sweet sauce with pepper flakes (a little sweet, but very good) and the sliced brussel sprouts (seared in oil with ham bit.....fab!)\nEntrees were melt in your mouth lasagna, ravioli, eggplant Parmigiana, and veal. There were just too many compliments to list here!\n We agreed that probably should have stopped at the appetizers after seeing the portion size, but hey, you can take it home, right?

The pasta (ravioli with 4 cheeses) and the spaghetti which came with the veal were not good, covered with tons of red sauce. The inside of my ravioli was actually cold. The small Cesar salad was drenched in dressing and not very appetizing looking although it tasted ok. The tomato bisque was very good. The veal with peppers was good. The plating, the heavy red sauce, loudish Dean Martin type music (which I liked - it was just too loud) , the darkness, all just reminded me so much of 1970s Italian restaurants. But the people are so so nice.
