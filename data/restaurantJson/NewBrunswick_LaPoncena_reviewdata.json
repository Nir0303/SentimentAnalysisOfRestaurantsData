Nothing fancy and not too friendly.  It's more like what do you want ? Rice and beans are good you get a little salad which was a little soggy. Pork chops suck ! NO AC !!!! It was hot as hell. That's just bad when you have  waitress service to have your customers sweat while eating.  It's very uncomfortable and should be fixed.  Don't even waste you time.

Yes, the area is a bit shady and parking can be scarce BUT, the food is worth your trip. Many people come out asking \"when is the next time I come back\". Great spot for lunch and it seems to have a full house most of the times that I have been there. They have the option for pick up and are usually on point with their promise time. The crew seems to be pretty friendly BUT as with many local restaurants they can have their days especially dealing with the people in the area that can be pretty rude or out of place at times. Overall this place has good food and for the price, you cannot complain. I prefer pickup over dine in.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-02-17T11:36:36-0500", "location_id": "4545130", "id": "348620551", "user": {"username": "Daniel P", "user_location": {"name": "Fords, New Jersey", "id": "46442"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": null, "title": "Ok food, bad service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46664-d4545130-r222601307-m11068-La_Poncena-New_Brunswick_New_Jersey.html#review222601307", "text": "The food is okay Puerto Rican food, a 3 on a 1-5 scale. The service however is horrible. You could sit there forever waiting to be served and they'll just ignore you. They couldn't look any more miserable serving you. Been there 3-4 times. Won't go back because the last 2 times, I waited for 20-30 mins to be served and was just completely ignored while they served other people just walking in, without any consideration for the person sitting in front of them trying to get their attention so I just left. Sad because there aren't a lot of Puerto Rican restaurants around anymore.
