For the money you can do much better, and even much closer to the hospitals if that's where you're coming from. Today I ordered a Philly Steak & Cheese sandwich, fries and a regular drink. It was over 10 bucks for that for a sandwich that came on a bun not much bigger than a hot dog bun. The fries were hot and fresh, but nothing special by any means. The steak in the sandwich was more like thinly sliced roast beef and just had no flavor at all. For the same money I can go to Firehouse up the street and get a large steak and cheese (twice the sandwich and 3x the flavor), chips and a drink twice the size of the one I got here for right at the same price.
