Really inexpensive.  For the money - totally worth it.  Very intimate as you are feet from the performers even if you're in the back row.

There are also some stand-up comedy shows that include great comics, and some shows that include both stand-up and improv.

Make reservations online PayPal or in person; found it hard to get past the telephone menu.  And then show up when doors open, typically half an hour before the show.  There are two rows of very comfortable dining room chairs with a variety of seating behind them and around the back bar ... even a sofa off in a corner.  We sat second row center and for this show it was perfect.  Several standup comics, a script reading preview, and several fast and very clever improv acts.  The three hour show was nicely broken with 10 minute breaks.  A spacious and easily accessible bathroom is along a wall between the stage and the bar.  Drinks available, and free water, too.
