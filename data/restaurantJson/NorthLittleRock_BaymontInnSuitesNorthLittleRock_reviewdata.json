Also, easy freeway access was helpful.\n\n      ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "bob P, General Manager at Baymont Inn &amp; Suites North Little Rock, responded to this review", "text": "Dear Mary,\n\nThank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at Baymont Inn and Suites, North Little rock, AR.\n\nYour business is very important to us and we value your feedback.
