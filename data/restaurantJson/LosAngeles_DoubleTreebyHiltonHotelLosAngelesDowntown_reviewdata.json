For my 8:00 a.m. return flight, I left the hotel at 5:05 a.m., and did not run into much traffic. I made it to LAX in 25 minutes.  Just something to keep in mind.\n\nIf you are using a GPS, be careful not to turn down Onuzuka Street, as this is a dead end and you cannot enter the hotel from this street (yes, I'm talking from experience here).\n\nI used the valet parking, which was only a little bit more than the self parking ($40 vs. $25).  \n\nI was greeted immediately at the front desk.  My king bed room was on the 5th floor.  I liked the style of the room.  The closet was large.  I was glad to see an in room refrigerator.  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  The room was spotlessly clean.  Like most center city hotels, the room was small, as was the bathroom.  However, it was plenty big for one person, and even two people would be OK.\n\nI met my colleague for dinner at the hotel restaurant the first evening.  We sat at the bar and really enjoyed the bartender (sorry, I did not get his name, but he was originally from Chicago).  He was so funny, and provided great service.  They will let you sample the draft beers before you commit to one.  The food was tasty (I got the burger the first night and the fish and chips the second night).  \n\nI walked around the neighborhood late in the afternoon on my second day.  The hotel is about a block from iconic City Hall.  There did not seem to be a lot of dining choices within an easy walk from the hotel that did not involve sushi (nothing against sushi). Of course, the hotel is adjacent to Little Tokyo. Yes, there were a lot of homeless people around, but not one was panhandling or said anything to me.  \n\nThe fitness center was well stocked with aerobic equipment - several ellipticals, bikes, and treadmills.  There were also free weights and a Universal type weight machine.  There were plenty of towels and sanitizing wipes.  I very much appreciated that the center was open 24/7, as I was working out at 3:30 a.m., prior to my 5:00 a.m. departure for the airport.  \n\nThe gift shop had a nice selection of souvenirs.  I got a cute Mickey Mouse night shirt for $20.\n\nAs others have mentioned, there is A LOT of street noise outside the hotel at night.  The LAPD is also only a block from the hotel.  The hotel does offer earplugs.  I have stayed in downtown Washington DC several times, and trust me, there are more sirens there in the middle of the night. I was at the Doubletree the days after Election Day, so basically ground zero for the protestors.  Luckily, I always carry advil p.m. and pretty much slept through the protests.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this hotel for the business traveler.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-11-15T04:19:10-0500", "location_id": "77714", "id": "437434652", "user": {"username": "Nittany&Fargo", "user_location": {"name": "Buffalo, NY", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Perfect downtown LA hotel", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77714-r437243122-m11068-DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Los_Angeles_Downtown-Los_Angeles_California.html#review437243122", "text": "Second stay here, great place.

My business was downtown and I typically try to stay at Hilton hotels because my husband and I are HHonors members.  \n\nPros-\nThe service was good.  We ordered room service twice, had drinks and dinner in the lobby bar when we arrived and had nightcaps in the restaurant (Justice) each evening when we got back from dinner out.  On all occasions, the service was fast, friendly and efficient. Bar service was excellent and we actually saw one of the bartenders deal with a problem patron in a professional manner.  I thought the wine selection was so so. \n\nThe food exceeded expectations.  We had breakfast on two occasions.  Everything was fresh and hot.  The night we arrived late, we shared an order of peel and eat shrimp and a Caesar salad.  The presentation was nice, the shrimp was fresh and the salad was crisp.  The rest of our meals were eaten out, but overall, we had a good experience with the food.\n\nThe staff was pleasant and friendly.  We were greeted by staff and asked if we needed anything on several occasions, including a phone call.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable (as I think is pretty consistent with Hilton).\n\nThere was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was decent.\n\nCons-\n\nThe hotel is very tired and is in major need of renovations.  The lobby was nondescript.  The rooms were small.  The ceilings are popcorn.  Although, clean, there was definitely no wow factor to this hotel.\n\nBeing downtown, there was a lot of noise.  I think there was a note that if earplugs were needed, the front desk had a stock.  We heard police sirens on many occasions.  This did not necessarily bother us, but if you are sensitive to noise, this may be something that is worth consideration.\n\nThe satellite television was spotty at best.  Some channels worked better than others and channels did not come in at all.\n\nThe biggest con was that I could not connect to wifi the whole time I was there.  Being a business trip, I needed to work, but was unable to do so without eating my data.  I called the first day and the person at the front desk tried to connect me to \"IT\" but after being put on hold, I was informed by an automated voicemail that I was unauthorized to be put through the call.  I called the front desk again, and this time she put me through to AT&T.  After several minutes on hold, I gave up.  The wifi remained an issue the entire stay.  \n\nIn summation, this was an okay experience.
