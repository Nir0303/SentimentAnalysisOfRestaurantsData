The best part about their pasties is that they are NOT overly sweet.  It satisfies the sweet tooth but not overwhelmed with sweetness and they taste super yummy.  I am not a fan of cherry pie because as they are usually so gooey and sweet, but their cherry pie made me a convert.  It was a little tart as FRESH cherries, yes they use fresh cherries should be, and the filling held up nicely when you cut into it.  It didn't ooze all over the place.  I loved the cherry pie.  The bagels were yummy, many different types, cheese, everything, jalapeno cheese, pesto.  But my favorite item was their ENERGY BAR!!  We took it on our hike and everyone had it for the first time and it was AWESOME.  It is a solid bar that holds up well on hikes, and I thought it would be crunchy like most energy bars, but NO, it was solid but VERY moist inside and super delicious!
