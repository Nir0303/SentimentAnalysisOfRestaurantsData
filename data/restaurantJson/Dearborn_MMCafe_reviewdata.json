All food is prepared for the day, by the hardworking owners, using only fresh vegetables, meat, fish. There is a \"special\" menu for each day, with homemade soup, plus their regular menu. The fresh made salads come already dressed with simple oil and vinegar.The owners are the only ones who who prepare the food. I have been going there, for the last 20 years. It is a comfortable, clean, nicely decorated space with lots of booths down one side and tables near the front. It is not a \"greasy spoon\" type place. They are not open on the week end and close at 7:00 during the week. Their patrons include many who dine/lunch there on a regular basis. One gentleman that I know of, has dined there for the 20 years that I have known of M&M. No alcohol, ample parking in the back, cash only. Reserve some room for Elaine's wonderful yummy lemon rice pudding, (or take a cup home for later).
