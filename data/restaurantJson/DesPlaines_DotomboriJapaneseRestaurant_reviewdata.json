Wish we'd tried it first. The nigiri sushi was perfect. We've seldom had as good and only one place (now gone, alas) was even slightly better. The pieces are the perfect size, too. They also have an extensive menu of sushi rolls. I'm not a huge fan of rolls, but these are so delicious-looking I'm definitely going to have some next visit. They are also enormous, compared to most other places, and it's not because they use a lot of rice\u2014just the right amount, as in the nigiri sushi. \n\nThe kani-su salad contained enough crab to make a light lunch, and the cucumber was cut into long, slightly curled strips. The dressing perfectly complimented both the crab and the cucumber. The miso soup is very good.\n\nI had the tempura udon, and it was excellent. The tempura was equal to the best I've had. My wife had the beef teriyaki, which was prepared almost as a stir-fry. She loved it, and I can't wait to sample the leftovers tonight. Portions are generous.\n\nI generally don't care for tea with toasted rice in it. I liked it here! I've probably never had it done properly before.\n\nTheir house sake deserves mention. We decided to try it for starters, and never ordered anything else. Slightly sweet, and delightful at all temperatures from hot to room temperature.\n\nService was very polite and attentive. These folks want to make you happy. Decor is pleasant but not fancy, distinctly Japanese but not traditional. Pleasant ambiance, although the music is not traditional Japanese\u2014a plus if you don't care for that sort of thing\u2014and not intrusive.\n\nThe only real negative I can think of is a lack of parking during the week (weekends are no problem, as the Metra parking lots across the street are wide open and free at that time.)

It was obviously a mistake since 2 other bentos went to a different table at the same time, but the people there started eating right away and the servers could not salvage our food. They did not apologize or give any explanation and made us wait another 10 minutes for our food. Bulgogi was seasoned ok, not too saucy, but the beef was really chewy and in big wads. Tempura was over battered and fried. Pieces were very big and difficult to eat gracefully. Came with 4 California roll pieces. We did not get any salad or miso soup with our bento lunches, not sure if they were supposed to come with. Overall, food was neither bad nor good.
