When you first enter the foyer and see the grandeur of the staircase that leads up to the restaurant, you begin to realize you are in for a special experience. You are greeted at the grand front desk and with reservations made weeks in advance, immediately taken to your table. \n\nWe were seated in a small room with only about 7 tables. Windows were abundant with views of downtown Tyler. Even with a party at every table, the room was pleasantly quiet and it was comfortable holding a private table conversation.\n\nThe manager treated us with a complimentary glass of champagne for our anniversary, it was an excellent champagne and a nice treat! I ordered the signature Hibiscus Margarita and Allan ordered a martini. My marg was fruity and flowery tasting, very light and wonderful! Allan proclaimed his martini was made by someone who knows how to make a martini. As a martini snob, he gave it a \"thumbs up\". \n\nWe ordered the Bruschetta appetizer, it was fresh and delicious tomato, basil and cheese served on perfectly crispy bread. For our main course, we both chose the 8 oz tenderloin. We usually try to order different meals, but neither of us could say no to this cut of steak. I'm not sure I fully understood the description of how they prepare their beef. It involved individually packaging, some sorta slow 60 degree bathing process, I'm not at all sure what else. But whatever it is, it resulted in the absolute greatest steak I've ever tasted. Phenomenal. Perfect. Amazing. All the superlatives apply. This steak is worth it. We also ordered the Lobster Mac N Cheese appetizer as side dish to share, it was wonderful! \n\nThe service was spot on perfect! Jesse was there when we needed him, and never once appeared when we were invested in our meal or experience. It was truly the perfect amount of service. \n\nAs we were exiting, we crossed paths with the owner and complimented him personally on his restaurant. This was not just a courtesy compliment, it was well earned. We will return to Jack Ryan's for special occasion meals time after time in our future. This is an amazing restaurant and should become a destination for all East Texas residents!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-27T18:10:42-0400", "location_id": "9564627", "id": "411631551", "user": {"username": "relaxalot2", "user_location": {"name": "Tyler, Texas", "id": "56797"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "A really good restaurant in Tyler", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56797-d9564627-r400505376-m11068-Jack_Ryan_s_Steak_Chophouse-Tyler_Texas.html#review400505376", "text": "I have eaten lunch at Jack Ryan's many times.

It's either poor staff training or an over ambitious kitchen. We ate at Jack Ryan's in Tyler yesterday for lunch. They promised and they delivered, boom. \nOur waitperson knew his menu, the techniques the kitchen used and made a very nice wine recommendation. But most notable was a genuine desire to serve. The setting is sharp and we do plan to go back for dinner. Tyler has needed something like this. Glad to recommend.
