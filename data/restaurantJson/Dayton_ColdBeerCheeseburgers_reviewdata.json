Cold Beer was delivered promptly - no problem.  As we quaffed, a few in the party got a better look around the place.  There was consideration of finishing the beers and leaving - several in the group were afraid to order food based upon the cleanliness (or lack there-of) of the dining area.  After a couple of the Cold Beers, the orders for Cheeseburgers began.  Nothing special but everyone in the group of 10 enjoyed what they ordered.  My burger was cooked exactly as I had requested and was quite tasty.  I would disagree with the reviewer who said the burgers taste like McDonalds... mine definitely tasted like beef!
