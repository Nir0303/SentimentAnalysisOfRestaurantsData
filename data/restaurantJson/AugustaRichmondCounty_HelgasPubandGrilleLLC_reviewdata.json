If someone is trying to make money here you could fool me.  This would be a nice place for a bar. Owners walk in and never speak to their regular customers sitting at the bar amazing to me.  If you want something to eat hopefully your willing to wait at least 35 min for the owner to get here before they start cooking.  The food is good once you get it which is usually 1.5 hrs later unless it's trivia night. Dave and Sam really need to appreciate their customers vs acting like they are doing them a favor by paying for over priced drinks.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-04-27T16:18:50-0400", "location_id": "5842415", "id": "368299253", "user": {"username": "tm4660", "user_location": {"name": "Augusta, Georgia", "id": "29212"}}}]}
