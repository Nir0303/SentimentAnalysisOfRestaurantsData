One section is an historical mural, another is famous residents, another is history, there's even a small country store and a small movie room where local personal history interviews can be seen.\n\nAt 65 years old, I enjoyed it. While I was there a lot of elementary kids came in in family units and sparkled with enjoyment at what they saw. It may not be for the world traveler or someone with limited time trying to see all of LA/Orange counties, but for a family group with time for a Saturday outing, this is well worth the visit.\n\nPay attention, they are only open on Saturdays (I was told the curator would open it for special requests at other times).\n\nWhile there, visit the library. They have a great deal on used books. You can buy books for $1 per shopping bag full.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-05-18T15:28:53-0400", "location_id": "8093727", "id": "272862928", "user": {"username": "Ken R", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}]}
