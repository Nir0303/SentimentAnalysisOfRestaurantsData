The Deep Stretch class I took the following morning has shorter holds, focused more on breathing and listening to your body rather than holding for a certain amount of time. Marcia gave the Yin and Sue the Deep Stretch and I found both ladies to be extremely welcoming and helpful...I hate to be bullied especially in a yoga class because I am extremely stiff and have back spasm issues but these women genuinely wanted me to leave feeling better than I came in and took great care to ensure my comfort.
