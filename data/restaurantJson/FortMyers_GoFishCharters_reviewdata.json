He also went to the expense of buying crabs for bait before we arrived, and took only 10 minutes catching scores of live bait fish that morning.\n\nIt was an unforgettable day of fishing - and catching!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-05-05T09:20:41-0400", "location_id": "2015986", "id": "270187519", "user": {"username": "AutoB4", "user_location": {"name": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "id": "60993"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-03", "title": "Captain Andy's Fishing Express", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34230-d2015986-r205717117-m11068-Go_Fish_Charters-Fort_Myers_Florida.html#review205717117", "text": "We took the full day fishing trip out of Ft. Myers Beach.  We boarded the \"Fishin Express\" at 7:30 and were given fishing rods and told we could pick the spot we wanted to fish from for the day.  We put our rods in the holders to reserve our location.  There were 4 of us and we chose to fish right next to each other towards the rear of the boat.  It was a 2 1/2 hour boat ride to the fishing spot 30 miles off shore.  We had good weather.  It was sunny, calm water and sweatshirt weather.  Once over the reef we dropped our rods that we had put bait on that was provided.  Each line had 2 hooks and on a few occasions we pulled up 2 fish at once.  If the fishing got slow, the captain moved a short distance to another spot.  All fish we cleaned and bagged for us on the ride back to shore.  There was a canteen with a cook on board to prepare fresh food.  We also were told we could bring our own cooler with drink and beverages.  It was a great day fishing in the Gulf of Mexico.  We caught red snapper, porgies and grouper.
