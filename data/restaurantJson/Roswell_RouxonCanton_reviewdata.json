I had a very flavorful gumbo with added crawfish, and my wife enjoyed the turkey wrap, with layered flavors that worked together quite well and quite unique.\nThe service and friendly atmosphere matched the food.  Nice selection of wine and beer.\nThis place was an unexpected treat and a great value.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-30T07:43:25-0400", "location_id": "2483460", "id": "399195017", "user": {"username": "Napleslen", "user_location": {"name": "Naples, Florida", "id": "34467"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Love this place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35235-d2483460-r397373526-m11068-Roux_on_Canton-Roswell_Georgia.html#review397373526", "text": "It's on my \"repeat\" list. virtually everything is tastes great in my opinion.
