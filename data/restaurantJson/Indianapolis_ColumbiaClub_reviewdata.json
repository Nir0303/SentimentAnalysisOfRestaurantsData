The Columbia Club hosts many traveling cabaret acts that features some of Broadway's top and noteworthy performers. Indianapolis has served as an interesting crossroads where performers feel welcome to perform and continues to maintain that tradition in great strides today. At the Columbia Club performers are encouraged to let it all out and often they do. Some of the benefits of the intimate cabaret experience. At times the historical ambiance of the club stifles the modern history of the city and the performances there in ways if the production value of the space and experience increased evenings as a whole would be breathtaking. For example, if your intent is to enjoy good food and wine before the performances, I suggest getting a reservation at one of the many nearby restaurants. The wine list is safe to say the least, and while it does not have any offensive offerings, it lacks any remarkable offerings. There is an opportunity lost here I hope can be resolved in time and with a little passion for the space that coincides with the acts that enter its hollowed halls.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-07-08T11:35:37-0400", "location_id": "5032726", "id": "390488643", "user": {"username": "Bryan L", "user_location": {"name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "id": "60745"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "great food.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37209-d5032726-r384641494-m11068-Columbia_Club-Indianapolis_Indiana.html#review384641494", "text": "We had both breakfast and dinner at this hotel.
