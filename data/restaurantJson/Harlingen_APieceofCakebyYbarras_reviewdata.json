I was very specific: like an old book, green or burgundy cover, gold fore edge, gold lettering for the quote and the title on the spine, marker of the color of the cover. Every single thing, I carefully asked beforehand if they could do it, the answer was always yes. One hour before the birthday party I go to pick it up and almost died on the spot. It had NOTHING of what I had requested! It was chocolate brown cover, bright white pages, white marker barely visible, orange lettering...They said they had tried but couldn't do it (?!?!). Oh, and that horrible piping...what the heck was that?? I had to take it because I had no time to search for another cake. When we cut it the spongy part inside was chocolate when I had specifically requested the pound cake yellow type. The only ONLY thing as requested was the filling of bavarian creme. The cake looked rushed and amateurish from a baker without an idea of how to do an adult cake. See the pics below. I won't have to point out which one was my cake and which ones the ones I dreamed of.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-09-01T13:21:32-0400", "location_id": "4999811", "id": "306064228", "user": {"username": "Guiomar1", "user_location": {"name": "Harlingen, Texas", "id": "55960"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Best Cake in Harlingen & They have Tamales Too", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55960-d4999811-r247910523-m11068-A_Piece_of_Cake_by_Ybarra_s-Harlingen_Texas.html#review247910523", "text": "If you want a good cake or sweet bread this is one of the best places to get either in the town of Harlingen.\n\nI recommend you go to a few days in advance to place your order but if you get here early enough you can probably grab a cake off the shelf and maybe get some Tamale's.\n\nPrices are a little high but you get what you pay for.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-01-06T13:56:11-0500", "location_id": "4999811", "id": "247910523", "user": {"username": "BobcatinTX", "user_location": {"name": "Harlingen, Texas", "id": "55960"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-12", "title": "Best Mexican Bakery In Harlingen", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55960-d4999811-r237623651-m11068-A_Piece_of_Cake_by_Ybarra_s-Harlingen_Texas.html#review237623651", "text": "My wife and I have tried out all of the Mexican bakeries in the Harlingen area and both think this is, by far, the best around!
