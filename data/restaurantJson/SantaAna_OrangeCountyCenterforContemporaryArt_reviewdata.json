The dancing was off the charts and since I have never been to a ballet before I was waiting for the performers to start with some dialogue, but they didn't need any after all.  I couldn't believe how many young dancers there were and how much they knew about the art of movement.  The principle dancers stole the show with an arrange of dances that had me memorized.  It was just the BEST!!

The gallery is in the Downtown Santa Ana Artist Village, and since I didn\u2019t even know this place existed, I decided to explore a bit.\n\nThe center resides in a brick/glass fa\u00e7ade building in an artsy area of Santa Ana, and while the gallery space (over 6000 SF) might seem nondescript, the heart and soul of the OCCCA are definitely not.  The interior is very simple: 2+ large rooms with concrete floors and a view to the timber roof truss framework.  There is plenty of space to move around and view the artwork.  The mission of OCCCA is to promote, exhibit and publicize a variety of contemporary creations from local area artists.  Experimentation and risk-taking are encouraged.  Censorship is non-existent.\n\nAs for contemporary art, I tend to dislike more than I like, but the experience of going to see what someone created is always worthwhile for me.  The \u201cH\u00f4me\u201d exhibition, now thru July 26, was moderately interesting.  Some pieces I really liked (the little shacks on the wall); others didn\u2019t make me pause for more than a few seconds.  Regardless, I will definitely be coming back here to check out more exhibitions.\n\nSome notes:\n(1) Admission is free\n(2) Parking is available in public lots (various prices) or on-street (metered).  Street parking is free on Sundays.\n(3) The Artist Village has other galleries and many places to eat.  Try walking around a couple blocks in all directions; it\u2019s fun.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2014-07-06T16:51:25-0400", "location_id": "6885313", "id": "213995208", "user": {"username": "Jim L", "user_location": {"name": "Tustin, California", "id": "33198"}}}, {"lang": "in", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Untuk wisatawan yang menyukai seni kontemporer", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33043-d6885313-r372533861-m11068-Orange_County_Center_for_Contemporary_Art-Santa_Ana_California.html#review372533861", "text": "Orange County Center for Contemporary Art, disingkat OCCCA.\nTempat ini didirikan sejak tahun 1980.\nMenampilkan lebih dari 800 karya seniman kontemporer. \nTempat ini, cocok bagi wisatawan yang menyukai seni kontemporer.\nBagi wisatawan yang membawa serta keluarga, dan anak remaja, tempat ini dapat dimanfaatkan untuk menambah pengetahuan, dan memperkenalkan tentang seni kontemporer kepada anak2.\nTempat ini, dapat dijadikan alternatif rekreasi, jika cuaca sedang hujan.\n\nBuka  : Kamis - Jumat -  Sabtu > jam 12 siang - 5 sore.\n\nTutup : Senin - Selasa - Rabu.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-05-13T01:45:22-0400", "location_id": "6885313", "id": "372533861", "user": {"username": "my1sthoneymoon", "user_location": {"name": "Bandung, Indonesia", "id": "297704"}}}]}
