The fresh sandwiches were so tasty... and very large. We enjoyed some of the creamiest ice cream we have eaten in a long time. Easy to find, open and airy, it was a pleasant place for lunch. The staff were so friendly and helpful. But don't be in a hurry if you are eating sandwiches; they are made fresh and fresh takes time. If we were staying longer we would be hard pressed to walk past without treating ourselves to more ice cream!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-10-31T20:34:16-0400", "location_id": "3833485", "id": "323536708", "user": {"username": "mreens", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
