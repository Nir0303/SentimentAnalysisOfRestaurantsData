The answer is The Grill!! What a nice, family oriented restaurant this is. Run by the attached church (name I never got) this was a stumble upon restaurant that I found when I stayed overnight at the next door Marriott Fairfield Inn. The menu has appetizers and many different sandwiches, pizzas and salads as well as a few entrees. One member of our party had the salmon which was exceptionally good. My steak tacos were great as well. The setting is very nice and I have to mention that the service staff is GREAT!!

The food was prepared and presented in true excellence. The value is unbelievable and extremely unfair; you should be paying more.

You seem to get lost in the personal space of the restaurant, great for conversations. It is located inside Calvary Chapel Ft.Lauderdale with plenty of parking and extremely safe environment. If you have kids theres a humongous playground next to the restaurant. \nThe service is 5 star, mainly because of the GENUINE care and service of the waiters.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-01-14T19:24:41-0500", "location_id": "3703012", "id": "149703597", "user": {"username": "oDuceo", "user_location": {"name": "Miami, Florida", "id": "34438"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-11", "title": "A fantastic discovery a slice of heaven!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34571-d3703012-r147815682-m11068-Calvary_Grill-Pompano_Beach_Broward_County_Florida.html#review147815682", "text": "I discovered this just by chance and what a discovery.
