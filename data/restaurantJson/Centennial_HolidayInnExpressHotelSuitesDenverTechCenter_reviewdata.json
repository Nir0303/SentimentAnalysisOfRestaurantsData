Every time we wanted to smoke, we went outside and did it far from the hotel. The manager told me they had found crumbs of marijuana in the room, but that does not mean we smoked in it. She then said it costs them $500 to get rid of the smell but I have a strong feeling they did not have to spend that money because the smell does not exist. We did not smoke in the hotel nor did we have enough marijuana to cause the smell to stay in the room. They turned \"finding crumbs of marijuana\" into \"smoking in the hotel room\".
