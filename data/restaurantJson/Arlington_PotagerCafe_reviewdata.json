Even if the menu seems unappealing, I give each item a whirl, and I've not ever been disappointed. I like a lot of salad and a sliver of quiche (which invariably becomes more salad and another sliver) \nI buy local and organic for myself, and it does me good to eat that way when I go out.

Each day they prepare a handful of dishes, which are always made using fresh, organic foods, and customers are free to serve themselves as little or as much as they please. After you are done eating, you can choose to pay whatever you thought the food was worth. I've been to that restaurant several times, and have never once not had great food there. That said, the service tends to be a bit inconsistent, and is at times downright rude. I've even been hassled by the owner (!) about leaving a few bites of leftovers on my plate, which was also the last time that I was there. Its really a decent place to eat at, but I wish that the owners had a better grasp of human communication and customer service.", "helpful_votes": "8", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-09-13T21:09:25-0400", "location_id": "2634797", "id": "228726133", "user": {"username": "729TGE", "user_location": {"name": "Fort Worth, Texas", "id": "55857"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "What a unique experience", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g30183-d2634797-r226993623-m11068-Potager_Cafe-Arlington_Texas.html#review226993623", "text": "This place offers such a fun and different dining experience.
