On a whim I checked out this cute little ice cream/gourmet popcorn shop across the street from the Sam Garcia Library in Avondale because, well, I just felt like I deserved a treat today.  Holy canoli, how did I, dessert lover extraordinaire, not know this was here...since March!  This has to be the best kept secret in the whole Phoenix Metropolitan area.  The ice cream is good - it's Karen's Creamery brand, a local favorite with unique flavors like cinnamon horchata.  But the popcorn is the real reason to put this on your \"To do\" list!  \n\nDiane is a Mom whose incredible recipe for homemade caramel corn had so many of her relatives begging her to bring some for all their holiday get-togethers that she had to invest in bigger and bigger pots, until she finally converted a small cement mixer (not kidding - it's there in the lobby) to keep up with the demand!  That lead to a small business, which lead to contracts with the Coyotes and the Suns, etc. and now this shop with so many gourmet flavors to taste, that this should really be in the category of \"Things to do.\"  It is a destination.\n\nRegarding flavors:  The original Karmel Korn lives up to the name.  It is \"2 Di 4.\"  You just can't stop eating it.  My favorites are any of the nut flavors, but don't leave without trying the unique and surprisingly good bacon, Southwest chili, classic cheddar cheese and other gourmet flavors, some sweet, some savory.  \n\nI will be buying several bags as locally produced gifts for my out of town guests this holiday season.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Krmlldy, Owner at 2 Di 4 Gourmet Karmel Korn, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you so much for making our very first Trip Advisor review, such a glowing one.
