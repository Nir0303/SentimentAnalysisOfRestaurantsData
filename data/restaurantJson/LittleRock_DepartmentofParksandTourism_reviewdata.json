First of all finding a place to park is nearly impossible as most of the spaces are alloted to government officials and those working in the area. Numerous offices are located at 1 Capitol Mall including the Legislative Library and the State History Commission among many, many others. You enter the building on the fourth floor and go down to floor one which is confusing for someone never being there before. The Arkansas Parks and Tourism office is not that large and is mostly set up as a gift shop of shirts. They can tell you what you want to know, but unless you are there for some other purpose there really isn't a lot of reason to visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-09-11T13:53:11-0400", "location_id": "144924", "id": "140029515", "user": {"username": "JCarterWatts", "user_location": {"name": "Pine Bluff, Arkansas", "id": "31858"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Arkansas's best kept secret", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60766-d144924-r122735447-m11068-Department_of_Parks_and_Tourism-Little_Rock_Arkansas.html#review122735447", "text": "These guys keep going and going and going.
