It was beautifully decorated. We ordered an appetizer of edamame, which was delicious. We also ordered a sizzling dish and a basket container of seamed vegetables. The sizzling dish had 3 kinds of meat, albeit in very small quantity, and a lot of vegetables. It was quite tasty. The vegetable container had a tasty sauce. Both dishes were adequate, nothing to rave about. The service was very good. The restaurant was quite empty because of the nearness of Thanksgiving.
