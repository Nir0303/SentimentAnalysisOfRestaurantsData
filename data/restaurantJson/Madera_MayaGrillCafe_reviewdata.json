Looked up restaurants on GPS and by chance choose the Maya Grill and Cafe.  What a great find.  It looks kind of small from the street, but the building is long so it's bigger than it appears.  It's very clean and inviting.  The host/server and cook, who came to our table before we left to visit and see how we liked the food, were warm and friendly.  And the food was really good.  This is a Mexican & Salvadorian grill.  They have offer all the familiar Mexican choices, but we decided to try the Salvadorian pupusas which are little masa cakes stuffed with six different fillings.  A standard order allows you to choose three with any of the six fillings.  All the fillings are cheese based.  Three by the way are plenty.  They were tasty, and filling.  Oh and the aqua fresco was amazing and by itself worth stopping in for.  If you live in the area or just driving by give this little grill a try.  It could become a favorite.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-08-10T09:04:46-0400", "location_id": "4624503", "id": "220888249", "user": {"username": "Jim W", "user_location": {"name": "Ukiah, California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-06", "title": "Loving Pupusas!!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32673-d4624503-r173245850-m11068-Maya_Grill_Cafe-Madera_California.html#review173245850", "text": "3 Pupusas for $6.99!!
