Not your typical fast food chain. They made the little breakfast burritos (combo $4.59) fresh - they were good, not fancy. My husband had French Toast sticks \u2013 I don\u2019t recall if they were nuked or frozen-to-fryer ($3.50). Coffee was part of the combo. Total $8.83\n\nWhile the building has the Burger Time name on it - as do the receipts - I recall them saying they're not part of the 'Burger Time' group any longer but the new owner hadn't updated anything. We ate here because we didn't see anything else on our way out of town coming from the Motel strip - that makes the location a shrewd buy with a lot of possibilities.  It feels like a Mom & Pop type of place - I hope they make it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-05-31T20:10:26-0400", "location_id": "5059337", "id": "276315739", "user": {"username": "LLDearness", "user_location": {"name": "Greater DC Metro Area", "id": null}}}]}
