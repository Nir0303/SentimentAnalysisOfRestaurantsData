Not that crispy, and a very mushy potato mixture inside without much flavor.  Fluffy bland rice.  The naan bread was very good.  The two sauces they offered were a super minty and a little too sweet sauce and a very sweet slightly spicy sauce.   \n\nPrices seemed a bit steep for the entr\u00e9es, around $10 each.

I KNOW what great Indian food is, and although I try it anywhere I can find it, I simply haven't found anything I got truly excited about until we tried Curry's.  Folks, this is FABULOUS Indian food, the best I've had anywhere this side of London!  I had the Shrimp Saag, and my kids had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Paneer Tikka Masala.  We also had an order of Okra Fry, which was out of this world!!  Every bite of every dish was truly spectacular, with perfectly balanced spices and flavors.  These people really know what they are doing, and it is totally authentic.  Highly, highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Indian, and definitely to anyone who has never before tried Indian -- you won't find any better than this!
