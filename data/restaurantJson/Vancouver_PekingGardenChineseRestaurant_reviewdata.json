My husband has been going there for over 35 years when he feels the hankering for some Chinese. We were there last night and again had the Sash wan beef (my husband's favorite all these years) and I usually order the green bean chicken, Love. It's always fresh and oh so tasty. The family style dinners come with soup, won tons, egg rolls, pork and shrimp appetizer's.  The quality & value are well worth a try to those of you that haven't been. Downtown Vancouver on Main.
