So glad we did! First of all, the location is amazing. Right in the heart of the city across the street from the Capitol Building. Fabulous view at night. The decor is chic and fun, yet very relaxed. Lots of couches and comfy seating areas, not your standard dining room. The service is really friendly and everyone was super attentive. Best of all was the food. Quite a varied menu with lots of yummy appetizers We tried many, but especially liked the brussells sprouts, the burrata and the hushpuppies. And all of our main dishes were excellent. The lamb was perfectly cooked and tender and tasty as could be. The gnocchi with lobster was outstanding. But the star of the night was the crazy pot du creme dessert. It came in a covered mason jar and when you opened the lid smoke erupted out, making it quite exciting, and the smoky tang gave the whole dish a camp fire feeling like you were eating the best smokes you had ever had.  There was also a very nice wine list. Bravo. I will return next time I visit Albany.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Leola E, General Manager at Wellington&#39;s, responded to this review", "text": "Dear yecats59, \n\nThank you for taking the time to review our restaurant.

Not Wellingtgon's.  Located in the recently remodeled Renaissance Albany Hotel, my wife and I decided to try the restaurant due fatigue after we flew a red-eye from Washington State and didn't want to venture out after spending a nice day in Albany.  We love ordering shareable plates and so we ordered their mussels of the day, mac 'n cheese with pork belly, and charred Brussel sprouts.  Wow!  Each dish was perfectly prepared.  Being from WA State, we know something about mussels, like local Penn Cove mussels, but these Prince Edward Island mussels were just so tasty especially the way they were prepared.  The tomato broth that the mussels came in was perfect for dipping with the wonderful butter toasted bread that came with the dish.  We had to ask for more so we could sop-up the broth and didn't leave a drop left.  The mac 'n cheese was just wonderful with great cheesy taste, but not dry.  The pork belly added a great flavor and was well presented in a small square stainless serving dish.  Again, the bread was used to wipe the dish clean.  The Brussel sprouts were perfectly prepared with the sprouts done with a slight crunch and well charred to add to the flavor of the dish.  \n\nThough full after these wonderful dishes, we decided to share an order of the apple grunt.  The dessert was prepared to perfection.  The apples and spice cake blended well and the ice cream and chocolate was a great topping.  Slightly tart balanced by these other elements helped to put an exclamation point to a great meal.  \n\nService was excellent and our servers were attentive and friendly.  The restaurant is modern and comfortable.  We enjoyed our booth seats that looked out on State Street, and is around the corner from the New York State Capitol.  What a great backdrop.\n\nShould we ever make it back to Albany, we would definitely eat at Wellington's.  We recommended Wellington's to our friends in Saratoga Springs, they will be making a point of visiting the next time they are in Albany.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Leola E, General Manager at Wellington&#39;s, responded to this review", "text": "Dear Atombrew,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review our restaurant.
