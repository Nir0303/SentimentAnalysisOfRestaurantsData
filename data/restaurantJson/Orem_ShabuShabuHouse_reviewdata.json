With that said, it's definitely worth a trip into the mountains for it.  The food is amazing, the service is good, and the atmosphere is pleasant.  I had a meal with two of my family members and our waiter was patient and helpful with us, showing us how to cook the shabu shabu, advising us on what to put in it, and chatting with us about the week's NFL results.  The portion sizes were large and well priced.  If you like shabu shabu or if you've never tried it, you should definitely go to the ShabuShabu House in Park City, Utah to give it a shot.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-12-10T07:55:38-0500", "location_id": "2538526", "id": "187282918", "user": {"username": "David C", "user_location": {"name": "Princeton, New Jersey", "id": "46756"}}}]}
