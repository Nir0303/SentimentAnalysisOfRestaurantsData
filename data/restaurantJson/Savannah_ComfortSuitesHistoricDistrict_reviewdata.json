Though technically outside this district, and admittedly across the street from some rather dubious project development, we were able to walk to the center within about ten or fifteen minutes. In fact, the hotel has a first-come-first-served shuttle to take you there and back, but we preferred to take in the fresh air along the banks of the Savannah River. This is a good hotel, focusing very much of the tourist (there is even an agent in the hotel lobby). Our room was OK, but a little dated perhaps. We also detected a little damp in the room, although it was hard to pin down. My main disappointment was that the breakfast room was full when we went down in the morning, so we had to wait for a table. The breakfast food was also rather average. But on balance, with the friendly staff and close proximity to the historic district, this hotel was a good pick.
