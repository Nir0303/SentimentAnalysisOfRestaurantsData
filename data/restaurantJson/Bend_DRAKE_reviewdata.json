She had a great sense of humor and she knew the menu perfectly.  She could and did recommend excellent choices.  My wife and I split a kale salad and lambchops.  They were to die for.  So far this has been the best dining experience we have enjoyed in the area and that is saying a lot due to the wonderful array of restaurants in the area.  The only negative is it is a bit noisy.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-08-19T10:36:26-0400", "location_id": "4291027", "id": "407561196", "user": {"username": "John D", "user_location": {"name": "Sarasota, Florida", "id": "34618"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "Don't miss the shakes!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51766-d4291027-r405738824-m11068-DRAKE-Bend_Central_Oregon_Oregon.html#review405738824", "text": "It's worth dropping into Drake just to get a caramel or chocolate shake. Beyond that the food and drinks were fine as was the service. Drake is not a great place to eat if you are trying to have a conversation unless you sit at one of the tables outside. It can get very loud when its busy. Drake puts a twist of one sort or another on most dishes. The night we ate here we had the fried chicken, pork chop, and a cheeseburger. Everyone thought their dish was fine, but not the best ever or anything that would encourage them to come back and order the same dish again.
