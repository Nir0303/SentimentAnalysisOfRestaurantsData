We go in here some weekdays for a beer and it's nice and relaxing. I play music from my phone while we chat. But on the weekends is a totally different story. The music is Pop or Hip Hop and nothing but the youngins. Some didn't even look 21 but they were checking IDs at the door. Some of the people are very rude. The music is loud so you can't talk and the place is so packed you can't get a drink.
