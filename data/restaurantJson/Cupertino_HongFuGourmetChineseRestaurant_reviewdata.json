It has a good variety of dishes on the menu which will suit for all the people.  The food is quite authentic unlike other American Chinese restaurants.  There are many dishes I like and here I can introduce a few that people usually don't know how to order.  The Lion's Head (fist-size meat ball) is super tender and it comes in individual bowl as a serving.  The smoked duck usually is my favorite and not greasy at all.   The beef medallions with mushrooms and black pepper is very very good.   In additional to food, the table layout in the restaurant is spacious so you are not back to back into other customers.   Each table has a white table cloth.  This is a Chinese restaurant where you can actually have a reasonable not so noisy environment to have some conversations.   The lunch menu is quite inexpensive with very good value.   I did notgive 5 stars because I have very high standard for Chinese restaurants and 5 stars is reserved for the top level restaurants in New York, Hong Kong, Taipei, etc.  Hong Fu is probably one of the top (3-4) restaurants in the Bay Area with food, service, environment, value combined.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-23T20:24:14-0400", "location_id": "473148", "id": "396036688", "user": {"username": "JamesY2001", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Favorite Chinese Restaurant", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32273-d473148-r387283103-m11068-Hong_Fu_Gourmet_Chinese_Restaurant-Cupertino_California.html#review387283103", "text": "Hong Fu has been my family's favorite Chinese Restaurant since we moved here over 25 years ago.

The entry has a small koi pond. \n\nThe menu has a wide selection plus now there is a new supplemental menu with more current Chinese food items including several spicy dishes. Tea is service. Beer and wine are available.\n\nService was good. Someone came to check on us late in the meal and ensured we had everything we wanted.

Only I noticed the place kept raising its prices, and it the place started to appear really dirty.  After having to use the restroom before picking up some take out food, I made my decision:  this place has gone downhill, raising its prices while ignoring upkeep and cleaning.  \n\nDon't believe me?  Take one look at the carpet and visit the restaurant.  I can tolerate some dirt in restaurants, with all the food and grease they are impossible to keep spotless, but this place is grimy and gross.  And since it is quite expensive, I no longer go here, even for the lunch special that despite the grime in the place was really really tasty.  \n\nIf grime and grunge doesn't phase you, and you don't mind paying a premium, give it a try.  Otherwise, hopefully the management will read this and reinvest some of their profits in new carpeting and bathroom remodeling.
