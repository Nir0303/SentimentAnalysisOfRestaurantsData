Breakfast is their specialty and served all day, but in reality the whole menu should be listed as their specialty, everything is delicious and plentiful.  Relaxed, no pressure, great place to meet if you want to spend some time chatting  with friends without noise or feeling rushed.

We were in the area and decided to stop in for breakfast again. It was about 7:30AM and there was only one other couple there. There was no staff to greet us or seat us. After a minute or so of standing around, one of the people in the other party motioned us to sit. Again we sat for a couple of minutes, then I got up and retrieved a menu for my wife and myself. We sat a while longer, still no staff. When I was ready to get up and leave (which I should've), a guy in an apron came by to ask if we wanted something to drink. We told him water, and for some reason he started to get us hot water. I walked over and told him in Spanish that we just wanted plain water. We ended up with one ice water and one hot(?). Finally a waiter showed up and took away the hot water and took our order. The rest of the meal was fine, I guess. The staff was in the back talking loudly, you could see them in the pass though window. We didn't see the waiter again until another couple came, who were obviously regulars, and he got their order and drinks right away at which time I figured I had better get the bill because I would have to wait 'till another customer came in to see him again. He brought the bill and never asked us how was the meal or anything. The feeling I got from this experience was that the staff doesn't care about the customers, unless they're locals, and the owner certainly doesn't care, because of the way the staff behaves. How unfortunate. It seemed like a diamond in the rough, the last couple of time we went, now it's just rough. Too bad.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-11-30T14:10:16-0500", "location_id": "4275859", "id": "242171759", "user": {"username": "adnval", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "Old style diner just minutes from Disneyland", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32420-d4275859-r175454338-m11068-Kaye_s_Kitchen-Garden_Grove_California.html#review175454338", "text": "Cute old style diner with the chrome and red vinyl seats.
