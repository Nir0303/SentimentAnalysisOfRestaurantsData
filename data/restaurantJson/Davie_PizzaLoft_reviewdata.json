Well, his longevity is well deserved because the service is efficient and friendly, the atmosphere is uncrowded and relaxed, and the food is always reliably fresh and good. \n\nOur visit tonight came about because I really wanted good Italian food and PL was the top of my list. We were greeted by the affable Jeff himself and quickly escorted to a quiet booth. As mentioned, the floor is uncrowded and with very light background music you can actually hold a decent conversation.\n\nSandy was our server and greeted us within one minute. My wife ordered the chicken piccata and I had the award-winning lasagna with meatballs. We both had the fresh garden salad with excellent house-made dressing and we also enjoyed fresh, hot garlic rolls, light and fluffy, not dripping with garlic like you find elsewhere but slightly moist on the bottom and coated with a toasted garlic topping. Out of this world; I could eat them like candy.\n\nSandy explained that the lasagna would take about 20 minutes or a bit longer so I did have to fret about the time before our entrees arrived, and I didn't. We took our time with the salads and within moments, the main course arrived. The meatballs are light and done right and the lasagna was piping hot. I will admit I've had better but it was very good in its own right. The chicken piccata was superb, with each bite offering a hint of the unmistakably pungent flavor from the capers - just enough to let you know it was done right and the buttery lemon sauce was the kind you sop up with the garlic roll. Having eaten our fill, there was no room for dessert and so we passed on it. Our cost was just $38 plus tip for two main courses with salad and garlic rolls plus two bottles of San Pelligrino. \n\nWe have had Jeff's pizza in the past and found it to be among the best in town. I also favor the chicken Marsala and when I'm in the mood, spaghetti with meatballs. Pizza Loft is easily reached, on University Drive north of Griffin Road before you get to Nova Drive on the east side. It's set way back from the street so don't be shy - you won't be sorry.

It is a great family restaurant with the kind of Italian food we like (causal and not frou-frou). We stopped going though after my son was diagnosed with Celiac Disease last April. We don't eat out much unless we are traveling because of potential cross contamination. My son was invited to a birthday party about a week ago though and it was going to be at Pizza Loft. I checked online to see if they had anything gluten free and low-and-behold they have an entire gf menu! I still worry about cross contamination though so I filled in a contact form to get more information about their kitchen. \n\nIt was late at night when I completed the form but that same night the owner emailed me and gave me his cell number so that we could talk the next day. Impressive! I called him and he immediately reassured me by sharing the details of how they cook the pizza and how they handle food allergies. My son was able to go the the party and feel like a regular 12 year old. He had his own gf cheese pizza and he even had (unbreaded) wings as an appetizer.  We were so excited about the menu that I went with the rest of the family to try it out since I only eat gluten free (to support my son). I ordered the gf baked ziti and it was Delicious! My husband ordered the regular ziti and tried mine and said he liked mine better. :) (He liked his too though.) If you are looking for a great pizza (regular or gf), and lots of pasta options and amazing garlic rolls (those are not gf but I remember them being awesome!) in a casual but comfortable environment, you should try Pizza Loft. I know we look forward to being regulars again. :)", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-03-17T07:27:56-0400", "location_id": "431982", "id": "260050017", "user": {"username": "Lucy L", "user_location": {"name": "Weston, Florida", "id": "34733"}}}]}
