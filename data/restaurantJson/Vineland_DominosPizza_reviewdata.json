Just too cold to venture out to a restaurant on Saturday night so we decided to take advantage of the half price - order online - promotion. Signed up with our local (six blocks away) Domino's and picked a delivery time and voila - the doorbell rang at exactly the appointed time. There were a few crust options - we chose hand tossed - and sauce options - we went with regular - and lots of topping choices. Sadly anchovies were not an option, but all the usual suspects were there. We ordered a 16\" with the regular amount of normal pizza cheese. Never having eaten a Domino's Pizza before we went with the basics for our first try. The pizza arrived piping hot and was really very tasty. The dough was just right - a little puffy around the edges with just the right chew and crispness. We both felt there was a little more sauce and cheese than we prefer but that's just our preference and not a criticism. Over all we enjoyed it very much and loved the convenience of a quick online order delivered to our door on time and hot. Nice job Domino's! Oh, and the delivery guy was extremely polite!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-12-08T09:40:57-0500", "location_id": "3966467", "id": "331464214", "user": {"username": "Avi525", "user_location": {"name": "Vineland, New Jersey", "id": "46890"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Domino's Pizza in Millville is better.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46890-d3966467-r220973320-m11068-Domino_s_Pizza-Vineland_New_Jersey.html#review220973320", "text": "They lack the attention to the detail and their wings are dry and bony covered in slimy sauce.
