Having not had a good Chinese meal since leaving Portland, we looked in a local directory, found Imperial Palace and thought we'd give it a try. The place was only open until 9:30pm that night and we wandered in around 9pm. What we found was a nicely-decorated, enormous restaurant that, at least at that hour, was nearly empty, so we started to think \"what have we gotten ourselves in to?\". Well, what we got ourselves in to was a GREAT Chinese restaurant. Service was very friendly and helpful, but we thought it wise to \"stick with the basics\". We ordered hot & sour soup, shrimp egg foo yung, braised string beans and a spicy chicken dish, served with brown rice - nothing fancy - but what we received were \"best of\" versions of everything we ordered! The EFY looked like a small volcano (big!), but was light, fluffy (like a great omelette) and packed with flavor. The string beans were amazing crunchy and flavorful - even the rice was fantastic - nutty, chewy and delicious on its own!. \nWe were sad to leave and even sadder knowing that we wouldn't have access to this place any longer (as we live over 500 miles away). We're not ready to move to Lincoln, but we're very jealous of people who can go to Imperial Palace whenever they'd like.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-24T14:49:33-0400", "location_id": "9594882", "id": "431338334", "user": {"username": "MikeGPortland", "user_location": {"name": "Wilmette, Illinois", "id": "36889"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Great Chinese Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45667-d9594882-r369297519-m11068-Imperial_Palace-Lincoln_Nebraska.html#review369297519", "text": "I have had a variety of Chinese food in many different places and the Imperial Palace is consistently the best.
