Only a very few times in lifetime I had this quality and taste.Even rare Tamago in a superb quality is excellent.\nVery friendly service, greta selection of different beers, nice selection of wine. I do not know if they have been awarded already, but they should apply for it, they will definitely get an award. Easy to get there (next to the State Capitol).\nGood mixture of gueast, young people, boomers, middle class people not over-the-top.
