We ordered the spring rolls, they were so good that we asked for another order. Then we had the pad Thai noodles with chicken. I wanted mine spicy and my wife had them milder. The portion was generous and they were quite good. This place has the hard half of being a good place to eat covered; the food. They need to work on their decor.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2013-10-12T18:51:27-0400", "location_id": "2308714", "id": "180748550", "user": {"username": "Bob W", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Charles, Illinois", "id": "36648"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2013-10", "title": "Just average and barely 3 stars", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g35942-d2308714-r180654522-m11068-Toom_Toom-Elgin_Illinois.html#review180654522", "text": "This restaurant has potential, but ..there are some cons.Firstly, they have no liquor license and i like a glass of white wine with my Thai food. The vegetable egg rolls were good, but tiny and the dipping sauce was less than a skimpy portion. My husband and i both ordered pad thai with chicken. It was good, but not memorable. I like mine served with some lime on the side. This was not presented that way. Aside from that the restaurant was freezing...A/C cranked up way too high for October. People including me were eating with jackets on. We finally asked if they could turn the temp up, and the hostess did, but by the time it got warmer we were ready to go. This is a small restaurant and service tends to be slow. As an aside tables are close and the diners at the table next to us all worked in the medical field. Their conversation was impossible to avoid and they were retelling guesome medical procedures they had witnessed, including talk of needles, veins, vomit, breach births and on and on. I mean really? This went on the entire dinner. This is not dinner conversation in a tiny space when others can't help but hear you. I know this is not managements fault, but it didn't make for a pleasant meal for nearby patrons. Overall, doubtful we will return.

Ate there last evening and was highly disappointed...Portion size for price especially for appetizers was poor.  Vegetable mix was odd-couldn't even offer green or red bell peppers-only banana peppers.  The standard mix is cabbage, carrot, pea pods, thin sliced zucchini (took a while to figure this out) and a little bit of broccoli.  This seemed to be in every dish.  No onions or peppers.  Ordered a dish with tofu and there was no tofu in it, so basically they took some pre-cooked tofu from an appetizer and brought it to the table to add to the dish.   So despite decent meals in the past, they seem to have gone downhill-bummer, we love Thai food!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-07-08T15:45:43-0400", "location_id": "2308714", "id": "166841351", "user": {"username": "Peanutprettybird", "user_location": {"name": "Sycamore, Il", "id": null}}}]}
