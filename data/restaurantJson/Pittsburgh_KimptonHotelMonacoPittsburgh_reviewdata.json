While it definitely included some of the things I loved, it wasn't quite up to par with my past experiences.  \n\nPros:  The location in downtown is a good one.  Room d\u00e9cor was eclectic, fun and clean.  Bed was pretty comfy (a little firmer than I like).  I always love that it's dog friendly.  Nice to have the mini bar/snacks available.  Agree with other reviews that complimentary water would be a nice touch, but not all hotels will do this. And who doesn't love wine hour!   Nice to have the Commoner restaurant conveniently attached as well.\n\nCons:  The staff was just not as bright and friendly as I've experienced at past Kimptons.  Polite and efficient, yes....but no warmth or personal touch.   I stayed for 3 nights and found this lack of real friendliness throughout from the front desk to the bellman/valet folks.   Also, I was not prepared for the parking challenges....you more or less need to valet as there is no hotel lot (for a fee that I was not expecting), and give 30 minutes notice to obtain your car...makes for inconvenient coming and going.   I realize that downtown Pittsburgh parking is a challenge outside of their control, I just wasn't prepared for this inconvenience.   Finally, my room was on the side opposite the entrance (low #s), and the view was literally into the windows of the building next door and you couldn't even really get a glimpse of daylight as the buildings are very close.  Again, it is what it is, but staying there for 3 nights with no light from outside was a little depressing.  Try to avoid that side when obtaining your room. \n\nAll in all, it was a super nice, fresh property, certainly more modern and updated than other hotels in the city...and I'd stay again (hopefully on a less dreary side of the building)...but hope that the staff can step up the warmth factor a bit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": ", Manager at Kimpton Hotel Monaco Pittsburgh, responded to this review", "text": "erin_mn4 - Thanks for the kind words!
