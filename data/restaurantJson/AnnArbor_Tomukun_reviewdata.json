We went with the combo and chose Spicy Pork, Marinated Chicken and brisket, and we ordered sweet potato noodles as an appetizer.  We understood that the combo would come with salad and rice, but it may be that we did not understand what the waitress said, because we never got rice.  We got the salad which was delicious and enough for the 4 people in our party.  The appetizers were tiny, but we got to sample different things so that was fine.  The spicy pork was really good.  The chicken was good.  The brisket was rather blunt.  The sweet potato noodles were very good.  The combo cost $45 and the appetizer about $12 if I remember correctly.\n\nThe service... now, that was unacceptable.  One of the people in our party asked for a fork.  The waitress did not bother to bring it.  We run out of water; the waitress never bothered to come and refill the pitcher.  And in fact, she sat down with other waiters, at a table across from us and started eating!  Are waiters allowed to sit down and eat while they are waiting on tables?  And if it was time for a shift change, shouldn't she have told us and have someone else wait on us for the rest of our meal?  When we got the check, there were 3 items on there, when we only ordered 2.  So i asked the new waitress who came to bring take the check (while our first waitress was eating and conversing with her fellow waiters), and she said it was for dumplings.  Looking at our dishes, she realized that we did not get dumplings, so she went to remove the charge from our card.\n\nI will definitely go to a Korean BBQ place again; but probably not here.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-07T07:22:32-0500", "location_id": "1917083", "id": "435367651", "user": {"username": "Travel_Addict_Cyprus", "user_location": {"name": "Larnaka City, Cyprus", "id": "190379"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "sooooo much food!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29556-d1917083-r430450041-m11068-Tomukun-Ann_Arbor_Michigan.html#review430450041", "text": "We ate on the noodle bar side of the restaurant for a recent Saturday lunch, while charging our car at the nearby library lot. It was not a game day, but the restaurant was crowded so the two of us ended up eating at the bar rather than waiting for a table. \n\nService was speedy. Portions are HUGE, and when I say huge, I think my bowl could have served 3 people (not just 2). Unfortunately, we were not going to have access to a refrigerator so could not take home the leftovers. \n\nWe started with the chicken summer rolls as an appetizer. They were tasty and quite generously sized. I had the \"butter corn ramen\" bowl. The description says \"crispy chicken\" but the crispiness is soon lost by soaking in the broth. In my opinion the chicken would be improved by cooking it without the breading, as that felt kind of greasy and heavy once broth-logged. The broth was rather too salty, so the corn added a nice sweet counterpoint that cut through the saltiness a bit. And as mentioned above, the portion was huge - too huge for comfort. I imagine a lot of food gets wasted in this establishment. My husband had the curry udon, and the broth was much thicker than anticipated but he enjoyed the flavors.

We ate in the Noodle Bar, not the BBQ side. Absolutely fantastic food. My wife and I both had the Be Bim Bop and it was great, reminded me of the old Steve's Lunch from my A2 school days. My boys both had Ramen, huge bowls of homemade noodles and broth that came prepared in a variety of ways. Everything was excellent. This is my new go to lunch place in Ann Arbor.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-13T12:20:02-0400", "location_id": "1917083", "id": "405001799", "user": {"username": "John G", "user_location": {"name": "Rochester Hills, Michigan", "id": "42644"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Excellent Korean BBQ at a reasonable price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29556-d1917083-r404291460-m11068-Tomukun-Ann_Arbor_Michigan.html#review404291460", "text": "We are long time fans of Korean BBQ. Some have been truly excellent and some a disappointment. Tomukun is in the former category. It was just great! Food was fresh and the restaurant extremely clean. The cooking dome was replaced between cooking sessions. To our surprise the server managed the cooking. That's a rarity in Korean BBQ restaurants where much of the meal is DIY. Would highly recommend for the quality of the food, the service, and the atmosphere.
