We since have dropped in after 8 pm twice and they were out of brisket so we didn't stay. I'm a brisket gal. Two nights ago we finally had a chance to go and I'm so glad we did. There were four of us in the party and we went at 6pm. Plenty of brisket I was glad to see. I had a sliced brisket sandwich and a side of slaw and corn nuggets. It was just really delicious. They tend to have live music beginning at 7pm and I am not a fan of that. We had just finished up our meal when the guy was setting up. I like to eat my meal and talk with my friends. One of the prior stop-ins we encountered the live music and it was just too loud; I was glad they were out of brisket. I wasn't tempted to stay and suffer through the noise. The singer was fine enough; it just isn't my thing but there were quite a few people there enjoying him. I liked that there were numerous games where you could sit and play and just have a family night. The building next door has been torn down and it appears that they have made it into an extra outdoor eating area with a stage. Perhaps on weekends the crowds make there way out to enjoy outdoor music. Also, I should mention that they make their own Root Beer; you can purchase it at the bar and it is good. One con to me is that the sauce is available by the drinks and it is cold. I like my sauce warm. I didn't inquire if I could get a side of warm sauce. Next time I will because there will be a next time. Really proud of Garland for adding this establishment to their little town square.
