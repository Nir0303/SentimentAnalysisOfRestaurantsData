Took a while to get a table on Friday evening (around 6:45pm), but we were pleasantly surprised by the happy hour prices!  Sushi was OK, definitely not great.  The hand rolls were low on fish and high on rice.  Nigiri sushi was also about average.  I had an order of uni, quality was great, serving size was a bit smallish for the price (not a happy hour item).   Overall, if you hit this place for happy hour, you will probably be happy.  If you come another time, you will probably feel like you paid too much for mediocre sushi and thin service....", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-02-24T06:27:10-0500", "location_id": "846316", "id": "152950303", "user": {"username": "Shane S", "user_location": {"name": "Tucson, Arizona", "id": "60950"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Now called Sushido", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32355-d846316-r78407173-m11068-Sushido-Encinitas_California.html#review78407173", "text": "This restaurant is now called Sushido.

I'm not a sushi snob, I do enjoy a California roll, so I don't know what someone with a better sushi palette would say, but I thought everything was yummy.  No bad fish smell, which is always a sign that a restaurant uses fresh ingredients and stores things correctly.  Attentive, unobtrusive service.  Try the Vegas roll!
