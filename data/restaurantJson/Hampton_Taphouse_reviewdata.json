The mussels were the best we've had all summer, surprisingly with vinegar, garlic and other wonderful flavors, really!! we've found that small mussels are the best, no grit, not rubbery like large ones often are..also had a Cesear that was really good, and husband had a seafood pasta that was excellent. Nice choice of appetizers, small plates, sandwiches, or entrees...Kudos to the chef on all accounts. \nIt was a good experience all around, eclectic clientele, nice choice of seating with upstairs dining, or booths and high tables downstairs along with the bar.
