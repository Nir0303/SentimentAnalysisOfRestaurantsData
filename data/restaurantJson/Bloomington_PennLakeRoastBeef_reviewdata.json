Since nearby Wally's was closed, I thought I should check it out. Went at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday night and I was the only one in the place, which should have given me a clue. I ordered the two roast beef sandwiches special for $6, a price that certainly can't be beat. But I got what I paid for. The roast beef was very average tasting and the bun was sub-par. And that's all you got on the special, the meat and the bun. Eating it dry was like eating a big sandwich of nothing. The BBQ sauce helped, but then the sandwiches basically just tasted like the sauce. Not really impressed and doubt I'll go back. The service was quick.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-07-10T06:30:16-0400", "location_id": "5051637", "id": "391003030", "user": {"username": "John M", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Paul, Minnesota", "id": "43501"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Waa waiting for my Mom at the dentist and I was very hungry.
