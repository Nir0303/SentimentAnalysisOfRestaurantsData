We showed up on a Friday morning shortly after 8 am and looked over the menu. You order and pay at the counter, receive a number and the meal is delivered to your table. My husband chose the Bowl ($9) house breakfast sausage, tomato sauce, stone ground grits, poached egg, and chives (you can substitute avocado for the sausage). He ate every bite and said it was delicious. I decided on the Breakfast Sammich  ($8) ham, cheddar, fried egg, special sauce, brioche bun and I went with the grits, salad is another option. The grits are delicious and the brioche bun is made in house - so good. We have a sweet tooth and couldn't resist ordering something from the bakery for later. The chocolate chip cookie with sea salt and pumpkin spice shortbread were wonderful. \nWe just ordered the regular coffee, but espresso, cappuccino, latte, macchiato and other choices are available. \nThe restaurant opens at 7 and by 8:15 it was packed. There are only 20 seats downstairs and about 8-10 seats at sidewalk tables. There is a small loft area up a spiral staircase with more tables and chairs.
