Not every single time- but enough times over the past year for it to be memorable -- the orders are bungled but more often, they never taste the way other buckys do. Almost always a case of too much milk. Beverages come out practically white in color & cold, lattes and braves have virtually no cap of foam and are almost entirely milk. My daughter will decline ordering from this location as her drinks are always off. Yesterday I got the flat white which for me, is a welcome balance to too much milk in coffee, in general. Two other locations (pearland & beltway 8 and the nasa rd 1) get it right every every time. This place sent it out *twice* as a milky latte. The top was completely white, wrong milk texture. And then try to 'explain' to me how it's made. Honestly,  i don't think they are getting trained like the other places or the expertise is just not getting passed along to new hires becuz there's always newbies there. They are friendly however, they try but something is off-- sorry but  I give up on this location!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-01-13T08:44:41-0500", "location_id": "854317", "id": "249155340", "user": {"username": "Seattleslew4007", "user_location": {"name": "Seabrook, Texas", "id": "56646"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-05", "title": "One of the Best Starbucks!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56144-d854317-r212485897-m11068-Starbucks-League_City_Texas.html#review212485897", "text": "A Starbucks is usually a Starbucks, same everywhere you visit, but this one is large and inviting and the employees are usually very friendly.
