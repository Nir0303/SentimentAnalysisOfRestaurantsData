We picked the Mellow Mushroom for dinner due to the reviews I saw and it looked more fun for the kids.

The restaurant is a chain we had never heard of - had a really nice patio area, and very fun and festive inside.  My husband and I noticed it was established in 1974 - seemed like it may have been a \"Hippie\" place - and now with a similar theme with modern d\u00e9cor.   Our server was very friendly - and the food was served timely.  The one major problem that happened though was that there must have been poor communication in the kitchen as our pizza order was messed up - but they immediately put the corrected pizza in the oven  - and so the problem that happened was that my husband and I were able to eat  - but not the kids.  Luckily we had the appetizer of the spinach and artichoke dish - that they both liked a lot..   So, we ended up with A LOT OF pizza as we got the mistake pizza and the corrected one!!   The pizza was very good - great crust - I could tell the second pizza was likely hurried as the crust was not as good.  I had the greek salad that was very good - the small size was plenty.

Do not miss out on the best thing on the menu, the Pretzels with Beer Cheese, these are always excellent, the pretzels are hot and crispy, the Beer Cheese dip is the best I have ever tasted, well worth the carb binge. If you are a fan of local beer, the Truck Stop Honey is the one we like the best.....but they usually have 20 or more varieties, samples are available.
