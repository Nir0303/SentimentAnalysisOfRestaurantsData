The customer service at this location is deplorable.  My friend & I ordered the 2 for $20 Deal they\u2019re promoting. My friend ordered Meatloaf, Stuffing, & Squash Casserole.  I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  The woman taking our order wasn\u2019t sure if the Pot Pie was included.  She asked someone on her headset and was told that it was\u2026 I told her what sides I wanted and she emphatically said it didn\u2019t come with sides. (This is from the person that didn\u2019t even know  the pot pie was included in the deal) I reminded her that the sign on the counter said \u201ceach Meal comes with a main course option, two classic sides and cornbread\u2026\u201d she said the pot pie never came with sides.  So, I ordered turkey instead with Squash Casserole & Sweet Potato Casserole.  She said it would take 10 minutes for the turkey.  I got my drink, unsweetened tea. I had to go back to the counter to get Sweet n\u2019 Low because there was none next to the fountain.  Another woman handed me Equal when I asked for Sweet n\u2019 Low.  She said that was the only sweetener they had (I stopped using Equal years ago when it was deemed the number 1 worst sweetener on the market) I drank Lemonade instead. I ate my sides while I waited for the turkey.  The sides were delicious.  My friend said the meatloaf was good.  As I was finishing the sides, a woman brought the turkey & gravy.  The turkey looked funny; nothing like \u201cRoasted Turkey Breast\u201d normally looks.  It was wet, it looked and tasted like it was boiled (see the picture).  It tasted awful even after soaking each piece with gravy.  I couldn\u2019t finish my meal.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-11T19:13:22-0500", "location_id": "7378961", "id": "347024458", "user": {"username": "James W", "user_location": {"name": "Orlando, Florida, United States", "id": null}}}]}
