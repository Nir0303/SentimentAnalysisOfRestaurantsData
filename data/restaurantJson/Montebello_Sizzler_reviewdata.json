The place was pretty noisy.  The salad bar was well stocked and I was able to do well with it and stick to my diet.  I ordered a steak and vegetables to stay low on carbs.  The vegetables were a bit undercooked (which is better than overcooked) and the steak was not good at all.  It was quite tough and came rare when I ordered medium.  It took quite a while to come out so I didn't want to take the time to send it back.\n\nOverall, not a great experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2015-05-26T08:27:37-0400", "location_id": "3324460", "id": "274687271", "user": {"username": "Valleyblue", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2013-09", "title": "Good food at reasonable prices", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32735-d3324460-r181486764-m11068-Sizzler-Montebello_California.html#review181486764", "text": "I've been to this location for dinner several times and the food and service has been pretty consistent.
