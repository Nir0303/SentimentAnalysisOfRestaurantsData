The menu is fairly small; pulled pork, ribs, pulled chicken, brisket, and brats, served as a plate or a sandwich. The bar-b-q is very good but the sides are only average. The prices at Piggy's are lower than you will generally find for bar-b-q. The dining area has five tables. On our most recent visit it took quite a while for our food to arrive even though it was a Monday night and not busy. Overall, good inexpensive local bar-b-q.
