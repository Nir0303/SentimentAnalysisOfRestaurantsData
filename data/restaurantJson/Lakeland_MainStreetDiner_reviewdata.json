I had their breakfast wrap again (eggs, sausage, green pepper, onion, salsa, cheese) and it is so yummy and hit the spot.  My doctor friend ALWAYS has a burger, but because she was trying to not have so many calories, she tried a spinach, egg, feta, wrap which she said was great.  But don't be scared to have one of their burgers for breakfast because she raves about them.  My husband had a combo wrap (sausage, bacon, eggs, onion, cheese) and loved that.  The counter guy (one of 2 owners)  told my friend that he was going to make a mac&cheese burger for the upcoming week for St Patricks Day.
