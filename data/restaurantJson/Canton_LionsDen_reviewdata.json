Our experience couldn't have been further from what we read in that article. Here are some good comments, but mostly bad.\nStreet to sidewalk right in front of the door not cleared of snow. \nVisible lipstick stains on two different glasses on two different tables. (Ours, and later saw that the table next to us sent one away for the same reason.)\nThe salads were nice, and were a good size.\nMediterranean stuffed chicken was very dry, and was supposed to have feta cheese, but this could not be seen or tasted. The mashed potatoes looked grey, and were in a ball, and were also very dry. \nThe \u201cShrimp Fahrenheit\u201d is supposed to be extra large and coated in their \"special spicy Cajun sauce\". They were large, which was nice... but the sauce was merely buffalo wing sauce. We actually found this to be funny, and are still making jokes about it. We'd rather still be talking about how awesome that \"special spicy Cajun sauce\" was! \nThe chicken parmesan was ok, but the spaghetti was just run of the mill, and seemed a bit over-cooked, watery on the plate, and not much of it either. \nThe bread seemed good-fresh and warm, but they put it on a plate with all of the butter packets, and to me, this just does not seem sanitary.\nOur waitress didn't know anything about the menu or any of the dishes. She said she was just there helping for the night, and didn't actually work there. The place was relatively busy, but far from full. We saw at least 12 different staff members, not including the kitchen staff, so not sure why extra help was needed to start with. The table that sat down next to us seemed to know the owners, and seemed to have really excellent and much quicker service. \nThere is even more bad, and not very much more good... but this gives a gist of our experience.\nOur waitress was very nice, and apologized to us for things being slow, and for her being there just helping out. The cleanliness and food were obviously not her fault. \nThere are so many choices of places to eat in the whole Akron/Canton area, We expect places to be clean, food to be good, and dining experiences to be good. In our case at the Lion's Den, it wasn't.
