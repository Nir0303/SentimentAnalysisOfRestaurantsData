And they have some good choices, at around $10/glass -- or around $5 for us:  a Fabre Rose from Provence, a Malbec, and a Russian River Chardonnay were what we ordered.  (Plus a Cardinal gin martini, with the coolest [longest] twist I've ever seen.)\nThe four of us split a charcuterie platter -- enough for four, and as one of us said, they take their meats very seriously here.  Highly recommended.  The restaurant has a very much North Carolina flavor, and a lot of farm-to-table items:  we ranged from a delicious shrimp and grits (even though he who ordered it does not like tomatoes or okra!) and a mushroom risotto to a Sirloin and a Heritage pork chop (my choice:  perfectly cooked, so quite moist, with succotash, which I normally avoid but which here was delicious, with corn and field peas -- nothing like the canned succotash I was forced to eat as a child).\nWe were too full for desert.\nTotal for four (two drinks each), including tax, before tip, was $176.\nWhat I like about Rx, and about Catch, a predominantly fish restaurant, are that they are self-consciously local in their menus and food sourcing and they prepare the food excellently.  Too many Wilmington restaurants have a kind of restaurant formula that lacks authenticity (and is not prepared with as much imagination and flair).
