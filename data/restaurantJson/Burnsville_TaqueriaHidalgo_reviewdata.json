I was running kids around the other night and we pulled in here to grab a quick dinner. My son had a carne asada burrito and my daughter had the carnitas tacos. I poached from both plates and wished I were hungrier. The burrito in particular was so delicious. The beef was seared perfectly, the queso blanco was generously distributed throughout and the rice was perfect both in flavor and quantity.\n\nThe atmosphere is bare bones basic in the most charming way possible. Something about it reminded me of the pork stores in the New Jersey neighborhood my husband grew up frequenting.  They have a few tables set up, some pastry cases, an ice cream cooler, boxes stacked all over, colorful signage. \n\nIt was humble and they just focus on serving great food.
