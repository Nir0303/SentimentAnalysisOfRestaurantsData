This was nice, as you'd be surprised how much churches and cathedrals aren't welcoming to visitors outside of worship times. \n\nThis is a very nice cathedral that's relatively new. The building itself is about a hundred years old, but it looks much newer. That's because a fire devastated the interior of the cathedral in the 1970s. Everything you see inside dates from then, though they have a done a nice job at using traditional decor.\n\nThe stained glass windows are very nice. There are also some handy visitor guides. \n\nFrom a secular standpoint, it's worth a visit if you're into architecture. From a religious standpoint, services are somewhat limited. Unfortunately, there's no daily evensong.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-04-28T05:22:53-0400", "location_id": "7241967", "id": "268519999", "user": {"username": "planetraincar", "user_location": {"name": "Toledo, Ohio", "id": "51048"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-12", "title": "Beautiful Church and Stained Glass Windows", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60747-d7241967-r238404452-m11068-Grace_Episcopal_Cathedral-Topeka_Kansas.html#review238404452", "text": "Across the street from the Kansas state capitol, this church has beautiful architecture and many gorgeous stained glass windows.
