I'm talking about every one of them too! Is it the way the food is cooked? The way they clean things? I just don't understand it. With that said however, this place gets 3 stars. It's on the bottom of my list of teriyaki places but it's still on the list and I actually return to places that are on my list.\n\nDark meat chicken was charred well and delicious. They served me a bowl of soup as an appetizer for dining in. The gyoza was good as well as the salad. The salad dressing was good not great and the teriyaki sauce was a little off but I don't have any major complaints about anything. My food was delivered quickly and was a good temperature. The staff was friendly and treated me well. \n\nI choose my teriyaki restaurants based on my rating of them first and then by their location to wherever I may be at the time. I chose this one while my car was being repaired and it turned out to be a good decision. I will be back when I am in the area and looking for a teriyaki meal. \n\nMy only request is for the restaurant to add Sriracha sauce with their condiments. I did use the hot sauce they provided but I'd prefer Sriracha instead or at least the option. \n\nThanks for reading.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-11-02T13:25:59-0500", "location_id": "4730312", "id": "323996753", "user": {"username": "mrbraae", "user_location": {"name": "Federal Way, Washington", "id": "58471"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Hidden Jewel, for Teriyaki and fried rice - Best Customer service", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58471-d4730312-r322677816-m11068-International_Teriyaki_House-Federal_Way_Washington.html#review322677816", "text": "Very happy, kind family run business.
