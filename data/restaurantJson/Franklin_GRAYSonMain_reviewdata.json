Exposed brick, soaring ceilings, and a full three floors of history and impeccable service. Their menu is Southern with a twist, and because they source so many of their ingredients locally freshness is never a question. The windows are often flung open to let in the fresh air, and the speakeasy bar on the second floor promises to delight with a late 19th century vibe and delicious brandy-inspired drinks. Ask to meet Joni if she wasn't the one to greet you at the door, as her passion and enthusiasm for Gray's are absolutely contagious - plus, she can tell you when to catch live music.
