Excellent carnitas burrito for $5. This is a little market that has a small kitchen that cooks up Mexican food. I can only comment on the Burrito I got, but as I said it was excellent. You need to order at the register up front, then take your number back to kitchen area. They call out your number when it's ready.

A small packet of grilled onions.jalapenos and cut lime is a thoughtful add on. Some other advantages is the fresh very inexpensive produce and perfectly clean beautiful meat market. My only downside..,is the way you have to get your food. You pay up front ..then go to the cooking area where your food is prepared while you wait. The great part ? The food is very low priced. My tip...go on off times so you have a short wait.

Tortas looked huge.   We will definitely be back.  The girl taking my order messed it up alittle but it wasn't too bad.   I only speak English not sure if that is why.   She put no tortilla's on our order for the Chile Verde plate and I asked for a flour toritlla, we said for here and she put it was to go.  I ordered a large Horchata and she charged me for a small.   Just little things.   We also bought some chicken to grill at home for the next day.  Was excellent.   We were driving home from outlet's and I found this place on Yelp.   I'm glad we stopped.
