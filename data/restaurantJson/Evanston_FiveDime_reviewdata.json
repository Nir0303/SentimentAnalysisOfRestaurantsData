On the first visit, each event attendee was issued three drink tickets.  I gave my first drink ticket to a waitress, and waited 10 minutes, but no drink.  I gave my second drink ticket to a different waitress, waited 10 minutes--still no drink.  I finally walked directly up to the bar, gave the bartender my final drink ticket, and asked if they could bring me the drink at the nearby pinball machine, where I was playing.  After an additional 10 minutes, with no drink in sight, I left the Five & Dime in total frustration.  I understand that this was their second private event upon opening, but there really is no excuse for this abysmal level of service.\n\nMy second visit was last week, for a fellow staff member's going away party.  I was hesitant to attend given my previous experience, but decided to give it a go.  I first tried to order a draft beer from our waiter, but was informed that there were no beer on tap even though a selection was listed on the menu.  I then ordered my favorite bottled beer from a microbrewery in Michigan, only to be told that they had run out of it as well.  Finally, after five attempts over two visits, I received my first drink at Five & Dime.   The beer was recommended by the waiter and was a good choice.  However, the $6 price tag for a local bottled beer seemed a bit steep.  When I received the check, there was an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill--on a drinks-only tab for two people!\n\nI have to say, the venue itself is quite nice--an expansive rooftop, numerous tables and umbrellas, and three quality pinball machines.  However, I don't know if I can bring myself to come back to Five & Dime again, given my initial experiences.  I am hopeful that they can work out all of the kinks before they get a negative reputation, as this could be a great place to go for an open air beverage and meal.
