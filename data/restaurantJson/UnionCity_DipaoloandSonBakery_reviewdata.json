I'm getting ready to order yet another birthday cake from them and will also pick up an assortment of Italian cookies and mini pastries for those that would prefer those over cake....but who can resist a nice fudgy cake with smooth, creamy dark chocolate topping :)  They also sell a very nice assortment of pizza, calzones and one of my favorite comfort foods.....homemade chicken pot pie!  For $5 I have enough for my dinner and some left for the next day!  You  can't beat their prices and also the smiles that come along with fantastic service. So glad I found this little treasure!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-03-05T16:41:04-0500", "location_id": "5088921", "id": "196368334", "user": {"username": "Kerrij53", "user_location": {"name": "Maplewood, New Jersey", "id": "46599"}}}]}
