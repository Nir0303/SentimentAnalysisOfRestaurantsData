The pizza was good, but not great, and most of the time it came out rushed and undercooked, still dough beneath the toppings.  They had a carry-out location on Harper, which was operated by Shawn Randazzo and his mother until they bought it out and renamed it Detroit Style Pizza.  \n\nRandazzo has taken the Detroit-style pizza recipe and perfected it, perhaps bringing it back to its roots in the process.  The idea of a Detroit-style pizza originated at an establishment called Buddy's Rendezvous back in 1946, by owner Gus Guerra. He later sold Buddy's and opened up the Cloverleaf Restaurant, serving the same style of pizza.  The Detroit-style pizza is a thicker-crust variety baked in a thin steel pan, with cheese spread out to the edges (which is how it gets its crispy black rim), and served \"red top\" with the pepperoni beneath the cheese, and sauce added only after the pizza comes out of the oven.\n\nRandazzo perfected the crust by making it lighter and a little more airy, and took his concept to the pizza championship in Las Vegas, winning two international awards in the process.  His version of the Detroit-style pizza offers the improved crust (not so heavy and doughy--it is actually crispy and light, when cooked properly) and fresh, generous toppings. What I usually do even here is order the pizza \"well done.\"  Don't be alarmed--the toppings are not dried out, but it makes the crust a bit more crispy and light.\n\nWhile I tend to prefer the more traditional variety of pizza, his version of the Margherita style pizza is also good, and his award-winning barbecue chicken pizza (which utilizes the contest's \"secret\" ingredient of Cattleman's Gold Barbecue Sauce) is surprisingly a lot better than it sounds, and quite delicious.  If a thicker crust is not your style, he also offers a traditional round pizza, as well as a very thin crust \"old forge style\" pizza that has all of the good toppings without the carbs.  Like other pizza establishments, he also offers salads, a couple of pasta dishes and if I'm not mistaken, his subs also utilize the same crust recipe, and all are served warm, fresh out of the oven.\n\nPrices are a little bit higher than other pizza take-out stores along Harper, but you are also buying far better quality all around than what you get for five dollars at Little Caesars.  \n\nWhile I will still eat at a Buddy's, Cloverleaf or Shields (another direct descendant of the tradition), Detroit Style Pizza Co. still has them beat at their own game. They've essentially rebooted the formula and perfected it.  Well worth stopping in!\n\nThe Harper location is take-out only, although they have two tables inside if you are in a pinch.  There is a newer location on Gratiot nearby that has dine-in seating, although I have not yet visited that location yet.  For both locations, you can now order online.  Look for \"Deals\" to get special prices.  They also offer catering for special events.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-14T18:58:58-0400", "location_id": "3599242", "id": "299375079", "user": {"username": "Wildcat_Rudy", "user_location": {"name": "Saint Clair Shores, Michigan", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-07", "title": "Best pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42669-d3599242-r298573359-m11068-Detroit_Style_Pizza_Co-Saint_Clair_Shores_Michigan.html#review298573359", "text": "Found this place by mistake.
