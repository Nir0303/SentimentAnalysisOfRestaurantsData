I've been to the Orange County location twice (once for my birthday and once for a friend's birthday). The location in the artist's village in Santa Ana is perfect - the large windows look out onto the square where there may be musicians, artists, or locals strolling around. The sushi class was so much fun, and I have been able to successfully make such at home at least 3 times. The Indian food class was also extremely successful - and we left STUFFED! I have also done classes at other locations - Hipcooks has a wide variety of cuisines, and the website clearly indicates if it is adaptable for vegetarians, vegans, etc (I am vegetarian and nearly all classes are adaptable). Throughout the class you will learn little tidbits to make your at home cooking experience better. After the class, recipes are sent to you via email. The best aspect is that the classes make cooking enjoyable and gives you the confidence to take on these meals at home. The pasta class and soup classes broaden your appreciation of these foods. I highly recommend taking a class - for fun, for a date, for a party, on your own!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-01T10:53:25-0400", "location_id": "7392613", "id": "305983568", "user": {"username": "puravida74", "user_location": {"name": "Orange, California", "id": "32825"}}}]}
