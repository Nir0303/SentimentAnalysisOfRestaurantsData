Fortunately, good service gave us the chance to sip beer (or, in my wife's case, a superb Cucumber Watermelon Lemonade). I had a hard time choosing, so our server (Marshall) brought me a small sample of each of the three most interesting on the beer menu. I chose a Red Rocket 16, a strong and tasty red ale. For food, I simply ordered Hand Grenades, stuffed jalapenos that were the best I'd ever had. My wife usually doesn't enjoy such jalapenos but said these were great for her. She ordered Cornbread Fritters and a Bowl of Chili Mac, knowing we'd take some home. The Chili Mac was superb; in my view, the chili with brisket was one of the best I've ever had. Both of us thought the fritters were also superb. Service was very good, with Marshall visiting us regularly to what more we might want and removing everything used as soon as we finished. The large room had six TVs turned to sports over the bar with others scattered around the walls so that it was easy to watch sports from any place inside. This was overall once of the best sports bars we had ever visited.

The service was great! Our server took our drink order and while giving us her recommendations our drinks were served by another server, and it was busy. We had the brisket, pulled pork sandwich. Both were good and the bbq sauces were yummy. But the appetizers we got were amazing and huge portions. Qe got the tater tot appetizer and the nachos. Can't wait to go back and try some other items.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-02-14T19:35:56-0500", "location_id": "8380060", "id": "347773144", "user": {"username": "JennyD707", "user_location": {"name": "Santa Rosa, California", "id": "33055"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Best Chili EVER!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32874-d8380060-r344383889-m11068-Sauced_Bbq_Spirits-Petaluma_Sonoma_County_California.html#review344383889", "text": "We had the Fried pickles and peppers and they were so delicious, a little kick but not too hot.

We were pleasantly surprised it was so good.  They had a great selections of beer and whiskey's.  I saw a few whiskeys I hadn't seen since a trip to Tennessee.

I normally tip that much anyway but I don't like being forced to. Since the servers are now guaranteed that tip, service of course has gone down. Food is still good but we most likely won't go back.
