Drinks were served promptly and were good, the by the glass wine list included some very nice selections, and the dessert recommendation by our server was spot on. As I said before, this restaurant is expensive especially for this area, but it is worth it in my opinion.

This is the place for ambiance especially in the beautiful summer sunset . I have eaten at every restaurant around small and big , so I know good food and good service . \nI've had to give this place another chance sine I understand the new places have to work out their kinks . \nTonight the service was better since no one was rushed over worked . The bartender let me try several wines before I decided on one I liked . She was very accommodating . The outside rooftop view is beautiful and comfortable . It's the chic place to be in Utica. Now the food .... The menu is not extensive has a few things of interest to most . A few things like steak , fish & chips , chicken , seafood . Menu is not big really . Everything ala Carta . Prices high for the area and food mediocre but you are paying for the atmosphere in my opinion . Nice experience but I can cook better than anything I've had there !
