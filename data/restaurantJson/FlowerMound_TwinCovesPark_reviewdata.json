The city had it closed for 2-3 years and just left it sitting, with it being impossible to get to the park without walking nearly a mile from the road. This apparently did the trick and the unwanted elements moved on. The park is now reopened with a gated entrance and fee to get in. Some people may complain about the fee, but considering how nice this park is, what it is intended for and what it used to be like.......I'll gladly pay the fee. Awesome place to take the family. Full details on the park are posted on the Flower Mound web site. Would have been 5 stars if not for the fees. Outside of that, this is a great place to visit.

Each site has a picnic table with a grill and all hookups are water and electric only but for a weekend stay it works just fine.  We had a great spot with a view of the lake and a very short walk for some fishing.  The park host was friendly and informative as were the people at the marina.  We were told the park would close this year for renovations so check before you go.  All sites will be upgraded with sewer hookups and new pad site.
