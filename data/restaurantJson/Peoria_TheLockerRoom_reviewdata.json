So glad we did!\n\nThe service was great. The atmosphere was good too. Plenty of seating and bar games around the room\n\nThe prices were seriously cheap and will be the place we go next time we stay in Peoria\n\nThe bathrooms were the only down to this place and why its a 3 not a 4 \n\nBoth the men and the women's rooms looked like a scene out if a horror flick to the point you didn't want to use it in the case you might catch something. The guys room door doesn't lock and is a single stall.  The women's room looked like someone's head went through the wall\n\nOver all cool place and hope to be back \n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2013-06-09T07:14:28-0400", "location_id": "4203136", "id": "163450541", "user": {"username": "wntsom4", "user_location": {"name": "Craig Reeves", "id": null}}}]}
