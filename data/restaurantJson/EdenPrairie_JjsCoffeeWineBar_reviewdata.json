Maybe they can do wine and muffins, but stay away from dinner!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-11-17T16:46:36-0500", "location_id": "5052526", "id": "240318661", "user": {"username": "DanQ67", "user_location": {"name": "Eden Prairie, Minnesota", "id": "43028"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Great work spot", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43028-d5052526-r224884468-m11068-Jj_s_Coffee_Wine_Bar-Eden_Prairie_Minnesota.html#review224884468", "text": "I am just leaving the most relaxing wine bar in the south metro.
