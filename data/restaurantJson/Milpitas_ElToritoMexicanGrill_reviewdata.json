We decided on El Torito for location and nostalgic reasons. We used to love going to the one near Vallco so many years ago. \nMy mom and I, and my sister and one of her sons each shared the fajitas (18-19$ each). Her husband orders the Tuesday special all you can eat enchiladas. Her other son ordered a macncheese/shrimp/cheese burrito (18.99$). \n1. Fajitas were ok. Nice presentation but not a lot of guacamole or corn chutney?  Steak and shrimp was good. Chicken and shrimp was ok too. A lot of onions!!!\n2. Shrimp/macncheese and cheese burrito was ok- but he was still hungry afterwards (growing 16 year old).  I thought it was over priced. \n3 Enchiladas were ok- nothing special. \nOur waitress was not engaging. She barely smiled and was always rushing off quickly. ( restaurant was not busy). My mom told her it was our birthday so they brought out 2 fried ice cream (reg $ 5) in a margarita dish with a candle and they sang Happy birthday. \nSo the fried ice cream was good but we thought the toppings was Special K or another type of cereal. Small scoop. I had fried ice cream in Raleigh recently and it was so delicious. Fried outer coat in a fried she'll with chocolate drizzle and it was enough for 3 people! \nAnyway. Our bill for 6 people came to approx $110. \nI gave it 3 stars because it wasn't horrible but I would not rush to go back. \nHave a great day!

Each of these tables were nicely cleaned and set up for customers.\n\nSo we \"understand\" the wait as its good to stand prior to dining..  After 10 minutes 3 people actually tried to help us find a table as neither one knew if we had been helped.  (hello - usually there is one attentive person to help people when they arrive).\n\nThen we got seated.  And again 10 minutes.  No chips and salsa arrived.  No server showed up.\n\nThen the server showed up and we asked about their margaritas and they said - well. You cannot order them here as they are only for the bar. And instead of helping, just walked away.\n\nSo, we got up and went to the bar. It was about 20 per cent full of people.  Again, nobody seemed to care about paying customers.   And we found one table which did not have an amazing amount of dirty dishes on it.   We sat down and I realized why - there was a constant cold draft coming through the door from the patio area.   Again, we asked about clearing another table and we were met with - How dare you show up 90 minutes before we close type stare.....\n\nAnd at that point, I looked at my husband and said - We will go to the one in Santa Clara, even its close to Levi's Stadium (which was having the outdoor ice hockey match).  We drove the short distance had an excellent dinner at clean tables with staff that cared; good chips and salsa; and yep 2 $3.00 Margaritas each.   \n\nIts like night and day at the Milpitas Restaurant - sorry, but somehow they seemed to have slipped amazingly downhill.  So my very rare one star for TERRIBLE.\n\nYep - we are out of here (hope it improves). There are other Mexican restaurants in Milpitas where customer is iimportant and the food is better.
