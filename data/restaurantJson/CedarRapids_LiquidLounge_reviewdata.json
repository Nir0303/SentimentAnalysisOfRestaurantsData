While it looks nice on the inside, the staff is rude and not welcoming whatsoever. I had to wait 20 minutes to get a drink because the bartender did not want to come serve me even though there were less than 10 people in the place. When it came time to pay my bill, I had to ask 3 times to get my check and it took more than 25 minutes to pay. I will NEVER come back here. EVER. Don't go here, it is a waste of your time and money.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-07-06T10:49:52-0400", "location_id": "5842564", "id": "389811758", "user": {"username": "Matt T", "user_location": {"name": "Kenosha, Wisconsin", "id": "60003"}}}]}
