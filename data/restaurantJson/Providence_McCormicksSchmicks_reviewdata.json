Green beans hard and tasteless. My husband liked his Tuna . We ordered Brussels sprouts and Potato and they were burnt and hard. We also ordered the maple  Mac and cheese with bacon. That also was greasy and sat heavy all night. We expected a fine dining experience and got less than we get at Long John Silver .

The Biscuits and Gravy have a parenthetical Death By Pork attached to them, for example.\n\nI had the chicken and waffles. They were excellent.
