It is upstairs on the corner of Mill Avenue and 5th Street in the heart of downtown Tempe. If you can sit out on the balcony overlooking the intersection it is a treat. Great weather and a great place to people watch and eat and drink with friends. \n\nI wold recommend it to anyone in the area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2012-03-27T09:08:24-0400", "location_id": "334783", "id": "126757913", "user": {"username": "mikegodphx", "user_location": {"name": "Mesa, Arizona", "id": "31281"}}}]}
