The time of day the service starts, is early in the morning (around 9:30am).  They have a \"traditional\" service (pipe organ and piano with choir... no drums or electric guitars).   I am not a member here, this was my first time here for a worship service.\n\nFor visitors:  A visit to this building is a treat.  There is a lot of art inside, along with the beautiful Tiffany stained-glass windows in the main sanctuary.  The sanctuary design style is \"Gothic\".\n\nOn \"Second Friday Artwalk\", this building is usually open for tours (the \"Artwalk\" is held every second friday of the month, every month... yes... even in the cold winter months).", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-01-24T05:21:10-0500", "location_id": "3750005", "id": "150496845", "user": {"username": "flintjarvis", "user_location": {"name": "Flint, mi", "id": null}}}]}
