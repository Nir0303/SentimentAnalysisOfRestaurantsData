It was average sized and had all the items you could want:  Omelet station, breakfast meats, cream chip beef, fruit, waffles, etc. but my favorite was the homemade crepes.  Delicious!\nThe table that housed the bakery goods had enormous donuts that were amazing!  One could make a meal just off that table.\nMy only disappointment was being charged for the beverages.  The coffee, orange juice and tea was not included.  I almost fell off my chair when they charged us for a glass of water.  That's unheard of!\nBut the staff was very nice and the food was good so we didn't say anything.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-26T15:54:07-0400", "location_id": "5047056", "id": "431975086", "user": {"username": "dragonfly429", "user_location": {"name": "Mays Landing, New Jersey", "id": "46607"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Long time Italian family staple", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46890-d5047056-r330165492-m11068-Five_Points_Inn-Vineland_New_Jersey.html#review330165492", "text": "The DiThomasi family has run this iconic local eatery for many decades and they have a loyal following in the area. This was a long time stop on the way from the Jersey shore to Philly. First - the pizza is outstanding and the dough is made fresh daily on the premises. Good sauce and cheese and a reliably good pie. My personal fave here is the spinach ravioli - it's really large (you get four) and really good. The pasta dishes are very good and usually enough to require a take home box. The steak sandwiches are also good here as are the burgers. It's a family friendly place with pleasant service and a full bar.
