I personally love the L2 which is the perfect combination of my favorites, shrimp and almond fried chicken.  It comes served with a yummy fried wonton and a generous helping of fried rice.  My coworker loves the Mongolian Beef.  They are very consistent so if you like them the first time, you will always like them.
