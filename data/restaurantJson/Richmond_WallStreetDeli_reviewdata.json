I ordered the Chili and grilled cheese sandwich special to go for about $9.00 including tax (which is a good deal or so i thought)...There was only one person ahead of me in-line and approximately 4 customers in the whole restaurant....There were two cooks in the back, the owner and a really nice and friendly \nwaitress...so they weren't busy..I waited twenty minutes for my\norder...when it finally arrived the chili was luke warm and placed in a skimpy styrofoam cup (approx. 4 oz). The grilled cheese sandwich looked about 4 inches by 4 inches(if that)...I said something to the owner about the portion size. He seemed to get irritated and gave me an excuse \"it's the biggest cup we have\"....Oh well...it's not the first time i've been ripped off at this place. About 10 years ago, i ordered a medium size sub and a piece of cake..It came to over $14.00....I thought i would give them another chance but it didn't change in ten years....So i finally learned my lesson...I will never go back to this place again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2014-07-03T08:48:44-0400", "location_id": "395313", "id": "213480890", "user": {"username": "Gcpk", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2012-05", "title": "Worth the wait", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60893-d395313-r136711858-m11068-Wall_Street_Deli-Richmond_Virginia.html#review136711858", "text": "I work very near Wall Street Deli and they have very good food and you won't go away hungry.
