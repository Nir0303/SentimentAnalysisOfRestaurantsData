Upon entering the restaurant me and my friend (we're a mixed-couple of African and Latino ancestry) seeing customers already seated dining inside at tables and outside on the patio. The waitress started to seat us when the owner (a balding, portly man dressed in a suit giving orders) interrupted stopping her in her tracks) telling her and us that a private party of 53 had booked the venue previously and they were unable to serve us that day because of graduations. I accepted that and we went across the street and ate at Abe's Kosher Delicatessen(which was great by the way!) After finishing eating at Abe's returning to our car in the same direction I became suspicious seeing customers still eating on the patio coming in and out of the restaurant. I decided to see what the real situation was and went back asking another waitress if we could get a table?  She said, \"Yes\" and immediately began to seat us. The same man in the suit stopped out again and we asked about the graduation and he came up with another flimsy story why we couldn't be seated earlier saying something to the effect he couldn't be sure what was happening that day. There were plenty of open table space there on both occasions that we were there and asked to be seated (we were well-dressed also.) Though I'm not one to immediately pull the race card every chance I can this situation really stinks all the way around.
