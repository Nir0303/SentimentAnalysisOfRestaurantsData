Our family lives down by the Battlefield Mall, so we rarely ever went to the Square, but what a neat transformation! This restaurant appears to be a slice of what the area is becoming - open, bright and fresh.\n\nThis is a re-imagined Tiki bar with classic drinks and new inventions. The GG Itch was quite tasty and not too strong for lunch. Fun drink names and glasses they're served in. Service was fast and quite friendly.\n\nThe Elotes was not the typical \"street corn\". This was the roasted corn off the cob, served in a skillet and topped with cotija, but the seasoning was too spicy and reminiscent of taco seasoning (let the corn speak for itself). The tortillas just disintegrated and couldn't hold the corn. Unfortunately, this just didn't work.\n\nThe GG Cuban and Garden Party sandwiches were fabulous, though! The Cuban had very moist and tender pork shoulder (as well as the ubiquitous pork belly) and the house made mustard and pickled pineapple beautifully complemented these. My sister inhaled her sandwich and proclaimed it delicious.\n\nSpringfield - you have a new hit on your hands!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-05-14T08:55:45-0400", "location_id": "10324118", "id": "372853322", "user": {"username": "stork90", "user_location": {"name": "Mount Juliet, Tennessee", "id": "55222"}}}]}
