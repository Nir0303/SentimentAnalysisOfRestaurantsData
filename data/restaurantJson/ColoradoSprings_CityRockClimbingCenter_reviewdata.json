The climbing center features a large bouldering area and a huge area for on belay areas.  The best part is they have approximately 12 auto belays for people climbing by themselves or for beginners who don't know how to belay a partner, such as my family.  The staff was incredible in showing us how to use the equipment and to make sure we knew all the safety rules.  They were outstanding when my sister did her 5th climb and for some reason froze at the top.  No matter what we did we could not get her to climb down or use the auto belay.  The staff climbed up and talked to her.  They were superb in making her feel confident enough to climb down.  Once down they made her feel good and ease her embarrassment by explaining to her it can happen to even the most experienced climbers.  Their demeanor was awesome and gave her confidence again so soon she was back climbing again on her own.  We ended up spending about 5 hours at the center and my whole family had a blast.  My kids climbed so much and had so much fun we are now looking for similar places in the state we live in.
