That means that over the years, we regularly went to Glorias Little Italy.  We could rely on plentiful fresh hot food.  It was always amazing.  We would start talking about going to Gloria's early on during the day so that we'd all be excited come the lunch hour to go partake of it wonderful food.  But, something happened in the last three - five months.  They went to an Express Lunch theme.  The Express Lunch just isn't as impressive as their lunches used to be.  One kid seems to be running the place.  He takes the orders, he brings out the food, he cuts the cake for the desserts, he dishes up the gelato.  It doesn't work!  He deserves a pat on the back, but he can't do it all!  Little things get forgotten or left undone.\n\nIn the past we could always count on fresh hot food.  The last two times that we went there for lunch, the food wasn't fresh nor hot.  This past Tuesday, my wife and I went there hoping for the best but kind of dreading that it was going to be more of the same.  \n\nI got the Penne Arrabiata (a spicy red sauce)  Every 4th or 5th slice of sausage was still cold.  Obviously, they fry up a bunch of sausage slices and refrigerate them until needed.  Then, pull them out of the refrigerator and warm them up in a skillet and add the red sauce.  There is no other way to explain refrigerator temperature sausages.  What happened to fresh food?\n\nAfter Ottavios went out of business, the next best place to get tomato basil soup was there at Gloria's Little Italy.  However, the soup just isn't as good as it used to be.  On top of that, I had to request that the server (yes, that same kid who was handling everything in front-end of the restaurant) take and warm up the soup the rest of the way.  Some soups are supposed to be eaten cold.  But, tomato basil soup isn't one of those.  After getting him to warm up my soup, I wasn't about to complain to him about my sausages.  \n\nMy wife's chicken alfredo was really good.  She loved it!  It seemed to be hot and fresh.  She obviously made the lucky choice.  I was a little jealous of her meal choice.  Although, over the years I have ordered the penne arrabiata maybe 10 times, this time it was sadly lacking.\n\nMy wife and I ordered a slice of cake.  Mmmm...  Now that is something that hasn't suffered with the change to the Express Lunch.  Although there were only three cakes in the display case.  In the past, there have been so many choices that it made it hard to decide what to have.  Maybe that is also a sign of an absentee owner.\n\nI think that since this is a family owned restaurant, the family needs to get involved in it again.  Leaving it up to non-family to run the kitchen isn't working!  They don't have the love, pride, and investment in the restaurant that needs to be there.  When the owner is on-site things always run better.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-10-21T12:24:29-0400", "location_id": "1027510", "id": "430398107", "user": {"username": "petr0glyphman", "user_location": {"name": "Provo, Utah", "id": "57106"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2016-09", "title": "Yep going down", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57106-d1027510-r424866506-m11068-Gloria_s_Little_Italy-Provo_Utah.html#review424866506", "text": "food ok not as good as it used to be - terrible lack of waiters they were good but only 2 in the whole place meant for little service.

The food was OK. We had 4 different people waiting on us at various points which was confusing. We ordered 2 local beers and they were out of one and only had one bottle of the other. When we sat down there were 3 dirty tables near us that never got cleared in the 30 minutes we were there for dinner. The staff wasn't that busy that they couldn't clear the tables and reset them. After my experience it was obvious why they are not busy as some other restaurants in their area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-06-30T17:06:48-0400", "location_id": "1027510", "id": "387975211", "user": {"username": "Richard R", "user_location": {"name": "Brenham, TX", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "The food was excellent and the accordian player was great.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g57106-d1027510-r375306609-m11068-Gloria_s_Little_Italy-Provo_Utah.html#review375306609", "text": "Great atmosphere on a Saturday evening.

The prago sauce was advertised as a tomato sauce with ground beef and pork.   I could hardly see any meat. The sauce tasted like tomato only, could not taste any other spices nor the meat.  A little parmesan cheese on top left us wanting more, but the server never checked with us to see if we needed anything else.  The gnocchis were ok, I would not recommend for the price.
