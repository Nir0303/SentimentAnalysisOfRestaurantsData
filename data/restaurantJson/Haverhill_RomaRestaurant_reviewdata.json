Both were large portions and delicious. We ended up taking half of our appetizers home with us. For the  main course I had the Lamb Kebobs and my friend had the Large Atlantic Sea Scallops. We also had the garden salad with a delicious blue cheese dressing. Needless to say we didn't leave room for desert. Oh well, next time!
