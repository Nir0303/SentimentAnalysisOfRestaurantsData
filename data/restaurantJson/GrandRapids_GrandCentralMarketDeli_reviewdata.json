True Southern Gumbo.  Deep rich flavors loaded with sausage (andouille) and seafood.  The gumbo had those wonderful flavors that come from working over it for hours. The dirty rice by itself had such wonderful flavors.\nThis Market has a wonderful selection of homemade foods to eat there or take home.
