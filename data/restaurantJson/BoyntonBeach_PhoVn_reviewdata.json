The pho was very tasty with excellent noodles and broth.  Our green curry was rich in flavor, but not overbearing.\nService was good.  The restaurant filled up completely after our arrival, and may have overwhelmed the wait staff, but eventually, our water glasses were refilled and extra napkins brought to the table.\nPacing of the dinner was very good.  Our dishes arrived as we finished the previous courses.\nWe are anxious to return to sample some more dishes.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-28T04:54:57-0400", "location_id": "4839446", "id": "314286963", "user": {"username": "Marvin W", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-09", "title": "Delicious ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34094-d4839446-r310314161-m11068-Pho_Vn-Boynton_Beach_Florida.html#review310314161", "text": "We found this gem online and it was excellent.
