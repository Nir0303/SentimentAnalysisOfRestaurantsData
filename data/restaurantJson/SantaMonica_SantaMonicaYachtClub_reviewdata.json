I thought Tar and Roses was my favorite Santa Monica restaurant but now it's a toss up. Andrew has done it again with his newest restaurant - SMYC, located on the other end of the block. It has a different vibe and menu than T&R. Both are charming, unpretentious and serve phenomenal food! Loved the sophisticated nautical theme done with quality finishes - teak beams overhead, glass fishing balls, rock art sculpture, enclosed patio, bar backlighting. Noise level is perfect for conversations. \nService is attentive, friendly. Top quality fresh ingredients, nice portion sizes. Some favs from T&R menu found here too (mussels in Thai green sauce and whole snapper). Overall SMYC menu leans towards fusion seafood selections. Served family style, I suggest 1-2 small plate choices per person and share, you'll want to taste everything. Pace it slowly, along with signature cocktails. Don't forget to try a couple of desserts.

Ever.  The food here was excellent, if a bit pricey,  Owner came over to find out how our meals were and chit-chat for a bit.  First dinner with my son and daughter in a very long time, and SMYC helped to make it great.  If you like chocolate, leave room for their chocolate brownie sundae.

Although I don't usually go for mixed drinks, the jars of fresh, handmade mixers lining the bar were too tempting to pass up. I asked the bartender, Cody, for something delicious with mint and ginger and he made me an incredibly yummy, refreshing cocktail. The manager, Josh, broke down the menu for us in great detail and enthusiasm. We started off with the stripped bass ceviche and mussels in green curry - both delicious and unique - and then dove into the fried red snapper. Having a whole fried fish on our table brought back memories of Southeast Asian food from our traveling days. The presentation was awesome and the fish was fantastic.
