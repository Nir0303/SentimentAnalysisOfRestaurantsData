When we entered we were greeted and seated promptly. Cool atmosphere...kinda urban/Asian/modern. Our server greeted us quickly and continued to provide excellent service for our entire dinner. I regret I cannot remember her name...young, blonde gal...very friendly and efficient.\n\nTo the food: We started with a few things to share. \n\nSoft Shell Crab Kara Age: I love soft shell crab and this was excellent and well prepared. My friends enjoyed as well.\n\nTuna Tataki: I don't care for tuna, but this was actually quite good, nice presentation. My friends who like tuna really enjoyed this.\n\nTiger's Eyes: I don't care for salmon and didn't like this. My friends who do like salmon said it was not that good either. Nice presentation but not good tasting.\n\nGodzilla: We all enjoyed this dish. Rather pricy for the portion though.\n\nBulgogi: My entr\u00e9e...certainly unlike any bulgogi I've ever had. Rather greasy and bland. very small portion for the price.\n\nBibimbop: One of my friends' entrees...once again, not like any bibimbop I've ever had/seen. The egg on top was fried hard, should have been soft or even more traditional with a raw egg broken on top with the heat of the dish to 'cook' it. I didn't sample but my friend said it wasn't that good.\n\nUdon: My other friend's entr\u00e9e...I did not sample but she was not impressed.\n\nOverall, would not choose to dine here again. Some things good, some things not so good or even bad. The fact that we had gift cards helped take the sting out of the rather pricy food.

The Crab Ragoon appetizer was delicious, the pork Gyoza dumplings were good, the Sesame Chicken was very good and the Hawaiian (white fish and rice dish) was pretty good exceopt for that nasty horseradish surprise bite. Comedy show acoustics were awful. When the mic/mike was used, the sound was muffled and we could not hear. Fortunately the mic started working sporadically and then finally not at all & was ultimately abandoned and we could hear Ok for the most part but the comedians weren't very funny. The routine seemed very amateur. Seating had no chairbacks and our bad backs hated the lack of support. Seating was also in poor formation for viewing a comedy show. We had to sit uncomfortably and look sideways, some had to turn all the way around as they were grouped into squares for visiting with friends. Hallway stench smelled like sewer backup but staff did not acknowledge it either time as they led us to our table or room for the show. Spouse honestly wondered if this was a health department violation and if we were at risk. Staff did not appear to care if we were there or not.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-10-07T20:38:06-0400", "location_id": "392558", "id": "316984190", "user": {"username": "Kim W", "user_location": {"name": "Waukesha, Wisconsin", "id": "60365"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2014-12", "title": "Decent sushi", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60097-d392558-r316465367-m11068-Sake_Tumi-Milwaukee_Wisconsin.html#review316465367", "text": "I was staying at Pfister hotel right by the restaurant, so I walked over here to eat.  the restaurant was small but it was nice.
