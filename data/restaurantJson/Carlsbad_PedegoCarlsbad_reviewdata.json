Once again the staff made everything hassle free. They safety checked the bike, made sure the batteries were fully charged, and told me if I had any problem on the road to call them and they will help me out. Anyway, my friend and I rode the tandem all the way down the coast up to the top of Torrey Pines. We were even pulling tired road bikers along to their destination down the coast. It took us about three hours and a quick stop at 7 Eleven. If you didn't know, Torrey Pines, from Carlsbad is about a 35-40 mile bike ride. So to conserve the battery, my friend and I only used the motor for hills. However, on the back we used to motor. Luckily we conserved the battery because as we returned the bike, the battery ran out of juice a block away from the bike shop. Our legs were done after the bike ride.
