It's a great bar to go to and they have a great food menu.  I can get the best of both worlds. The bar-tenders are very nice. The owner is usually on site to greet the patrons. There open for lunch and dinner. The beers that I drink are always ice cold. They have daily food specials and I have never had a bad meal there. It's a must go if you are in Kenner Louisiana.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-09-06T01:38:40-0400", "location_id": "9986291", "id": "415232602", "user": {"username": "Jorge C", "user_location": {"name": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "id": "60864"}}}]}
