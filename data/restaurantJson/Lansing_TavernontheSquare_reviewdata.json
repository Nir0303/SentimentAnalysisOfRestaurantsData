My wife lettuce wraps was a bowl of sweet teriyaki sauce with chow mein noodles to dip the chicken in.  We asked for a locally brewed beer and the waitress did not know much about the beer on tap.  Suggested Great Lakes Brewery (Cleveland brewery).  \nBottom line we ordered the wrong food, should of looked at what was coming out of the kitchen and ordered the same.  Maybe they were short staffed this night but our server did not know much about the beers on tap.  \nEvery restaurant has a off night, think we caught it on our first visit.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2013-05-04T05:15:22-0400", "location_id": "634182", "id": "159611097", "user": {"username": "torchlake99", "user_location": {"name": "traverse city,mi", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-11", "title": "5 stars.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42391-d634182-r147066681-m11068-Tavern_on_the_Square-Lansing_Ingham_County_Michigan.html#review147066681", "text": "So my boyfriend lives in Lansing but he rarely ever gets adventurous enough to find new places to eat. So we got on urbanspoon and Tavern on the Square came up. We went on a Saturday and we had to sit at the bar to wait on a table, the place is a pretty decent size with the upstairs, but someone was having a party. I LOVED the atmosphere. The staff was really nice as well. I got the Spanish Chicken salad which was super delicious and just the right size. My boyfriend got the fish and chips and the complaint was from him, no tartar sauce. Which most people expect to get with their fish and chips but I don't think he read the menu. We also got the deep fried green beans, I think they tried to dress up the name by calling it 'tempura green beans' but it was not as light as traditional Japanese tempura I can't wait to go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-12-09T07:55:43-0500", "location_id": "634182", "id": "147066681", "user": {"username": "horseplay49", "user_location": {"name": "Detroit", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-10", "title": "Trendy bar and grill.", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42391-d634182-r143801778-m11068-Tavern_on_the_Square-Lansing_Ingham_County_Michigan.html#review143801778", "text": "We went with our children for drinks and dinner.

There is a fireplace in the outdoor seated entrance and so many different types of dining options (from large group - loft area, to cozy little hide-aways for two)...

The salsbury steak soup was seasoned to perfection and the pasta with mushrooms, wine sauce, artichoke and grilled chicken was wonderful and enough food for two days (at least - could have stretched it to three).  We are looking forward to going back for a Happy Hour and with a large group because it's a really nice gathering spot!!!  Oh, and how could I possibly forget the desert?
