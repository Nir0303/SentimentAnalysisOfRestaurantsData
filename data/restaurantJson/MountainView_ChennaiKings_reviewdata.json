I came by to get food to-go in the middle of the afternoon.  The menu baffled me a bit because it is so region-specific - Southern Indian.  I ended up ordering pretty safe: biryani, chicken curry, mushroom curry.  \n\nThe food is good; well spiced and generous in portion.  In fact, the biryani had so much spice, it was tricky to eat.  Both the curries are great.  I try to order garlic naan, but they only have plain naan.  \n\nThe whole place has a youthful, energetic feel to it; lots of sports influence with the TV and team colors.  I can totally imagine young Indian engineers sitting down with their friends having a meal here and enjoy their time here.  I would love to come back and dine it.  \n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-10-23T20:14:40-0400", "location_id": "8672270", "id": "431062048", "user": {"username": "Minnie Y", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": "60713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Good south indian food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32761-d8672270-r392789528-m11068-Chennai_Kings-Mountain_View_California.html#review392789528", "text": "The ambiance is good.

That's where it ends.  I took the recommendation of the wait person on which dosa to order. He suggested Mysore Masala. They brought me Masala Dosa - perhaps thinking they could slip it by someone who was not from South India. Having a weakness for dosas and knowing the difference, I had to inquire.  The second staff member said they did not make Mysore Masala at this location. The two are not quite different in how they are made. The one I ordered was simply supposed to have an additional smearing of spice on the inside. The wait person recommended fish for appetizer. I ordered the Nithelli Fish. It was not freshly fried. was served re-fried, leathery, barely warm, and with garnishing of wilted onions. I could not eat the fish and returned it; I was not charged for the fish. Byt now the staff is no longer feeling the need to be attentive.  I finally decided to try the order of 4 Idli's shown in the menu pictures with three chutney's. The idli came warm, which justified why it took very long. There was only one chutney that accompanied. Most South Indian restaurants also have the ginger / tomato chutney. This one doesn't provide the tomato / ginger base that at all; think about it - it would be the most expensive to prepare compared to other two.  The dosa and idli both came with fewer number and random choice of chutney - what seemed to be available to the chef, not the ones show in the menu or customary in similar restaurants.  The owner was was out to India, leaving the place un-supervised and un-cared. In all, this was a disappointing experience during my trip considering the Bay Area is know for decent Indian cuisine. I can easily find an alternative next time. I asked for the fish to be added to the bill. I left a 15% tip and decided not to go return to this place or its other location in the Bay Area.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-14T20:49:44-0400", "location_id": "8672270", "id": "355444984", "user": {"username": "A A", "user_location": {"name": "San Francisco, California", "id": "60713"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Good south indian food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32761-d8672270-r350023805-m11068-Chennai_Kings-Mountain_View_California.html#review350023805", "text": "Excellent South Indian food.

We were pleasantly surprised that this restaurant also served Chettinad food - hot spicy, vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes from the Chettinad part of South India. The restaurant has limited parking in its inset location off El Camino Real near the Castro area. Street parking is available at the meters nearby. The decor is done with a cricket theme (Chennai Kings are a cricket team from Chennai in South India). The service was very pleasant and the overall dining experience a very good one. You can ask for different levels of heat in the dishes according to your own specific tastes. \n\nI had the plain dosa - pretty much OK but the accompanying sauces/chutneys were very tasty as was the sambhar. The dosas were not as crisp as I usually like them nor were they as large as the ones served in a local place in Fairfax that extend beyond your table and block the corridor!\n\nMy nephew and daughter had the idyappam with a vegetable kurma - a spicy coconut based curry that was quite tasty. My nephew also had the idli with chicken curry cooked Chettinad style and he pronounced it goos. He is himself a trained and qualified chef who has ventured into the Chettinad area both to savor the dishes and learn to cook Chettinad style.  We had the South Indian Filter coffee (it was reasonably good but is definitely recommended as a capstone on South Indian food).\n\nThe restaurant is unpretentious and is excellent for casual dining with a home cooking atmosphere and tables that are children friendly. Space is a little cramped. The menu is a simple one page one with the right amount of variety to suit many palates. The availability of both vegetarian and non vegetarian options is definitely attractive for mixed groups.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-09-29T06:12:40-0400", "location_id": "8672270", "id": "314696880", "user": {"username": "Shutterbug35", "user_location": {"name": "Fairfax, Virginia", "id": "57718"}}}]}
