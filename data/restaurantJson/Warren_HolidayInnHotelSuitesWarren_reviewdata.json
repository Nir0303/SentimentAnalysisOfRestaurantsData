I am staying here because I needed to stay somewhere close to the GM Tech Center. Upon arriving at the hotel it took 20 minutes before I received my room card (not acceptable if you ask me). There was only one women at the counter and two guests in front of me, all the while she fielded 3 phone calls from outside guests before I was taken care of. She was very friendly and apologetic and I had plenty of time to kill so it was no big deal. I took the elevator up and low and behold they put me in the room directly across from the elevator. Ughh, I tried to make it work but I am staying here on business and need to be able to get a good nice rest. I went back down stairs to request a new room and had to wait another 10 minutes in line while she struggled to check everyone in (I really felt bad because the line was literally so long that it was out the hotel door). 2 guests in front of me and 4 behind me and people calling. This hotel really needs to staff the front better and give this poor woman some assistance. She kindly swapped my room away from the elevator, yay!!! Right? No, the second room was covered in hair, hair on 3 out of 4 pillows, hair all over the bed sheet, some trash was actually left on the table (it was clothes tags from marshals) that was never picked up. None of the toiletries were replenished either, no soap or shampoo. I called down and told her the issue, she sent someone up who gave me a new room key. Okay, on to the third room, I arrived and guess what? More hair!!!! 1 out of 4 pillows had a long stringy hair on it!!! Gross....I sucked it up and just tossed it on the ground. They actually called from the front inquiring about the new room. I felt obligated to be honest and I told her I found another hair on one of the pillows but it's fine I just tossed it on the ground. She was very apologetic again and said she could not lower my rate since I supposedly had the lowest eligible rate ($99for the night) bs if you ask me (mind you I never asked for a rate down either) and I was on the companies dime anyways. She did offer to send up a fruit plate which I have not tried yet and gave me an additional 2500 points on my IGH account. Whatever...I appreciate the thought but the inconvenience is simply not worth it. Offering me free breakfast would have been nice but that did not happen. Also, to add details about the third room, there was a red stain on the tub, piece of hair on the toilet seat, could hear neighboring doors slamming all night as guests arrive. On to the air conditioning unit/fan....I had it set to 72 degrees cool (not heat) (outside weather was only a high of 66 degrees) no problem, right? No...the unit fired up about every ten minutes to cool the room and it literally sounded like a diesel truck hitting the gas outside the hotel every time, not kidding. I wish I could upload a sound clip to show everyone.?I haven't slept this bad in some time. I will rate this hotel 1/5 stars. I will not be staying here again....ever.

But, last week, on a quick business trip to Sterling Heights, the Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Warren seemed like the best option.  \n\nThe proporty is on Van Dyke, right across from the GM Tech Center.  The area is bit depressed looking.  It seems like there aging parking lots around the hotel, than fuctioning businesses.  However, with GM investing a $1B in the tech center, I'd bet that's going to change soon. \n\nThe hotel proved to be just fine for my needs.  The lobby area could use a little updating, but my room was clean, bright, and comfortable.  The wifi was free and functioned well.  I also liked that they have a free \"Customer Appreciation Dinner\" Monday through Wednesday. It was nothing fancy, but worked out well for me.  Finally, the free breakfast was actually pretty good.  It included a prepared meal AND a simple buffet.  \n\nIf you're looking for basic, no-frills accomodation in the Warren/Sterling Heights area, then this hotel will work for you.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Neran M, Director of Sales at Holiday Inn Hotel &amp; Suites Warren, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for  your review.\r\n\r\nWe greatly appreciate all your wonderful comments about our facility.

We arrived at night after a long drive and just slept early. My husband went to have his meeting in the morning as I stayed at the hotel. Around 10am as I'm about to go use the bathroom I saw a cockroach looking bug I'm not sure what to call it but it looks like a cockroach at the floor. I took pictureS of it and sent one of the pics to my husband I said I don't want to spend another night there. After my husband's meeting he went back to the hotel and complain about it showed the picture to the front desk staff and they just not charge us for our stay and gave us 5,000 points to his ihg membership. We left the room and they stopped us at the lobby to tell us that the picture is not taken from their hotel. My husband was so upset and gave them the napkin with the roach on it. And I offered to show them more pictures since they are insinuating that we're lying. This is holiday inn not a cheap motel. I have the pictures and they could see the time the picture was taken and where it was taken don't make us look like liars. We travel so much and stay in alot of hotels. We don't need refunds. the company my husband works for pays for it, we don't have to lie and bring roach. I just hope your roach did not hop in our luggage. Not staying again and definitely won't recommend.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Neran M, Director of Sales at Holiday Inn Hotel &amp; Suites Warren, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for being our guest !\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for falling short of your expectations.\r\n\r\nWhen your husband provided the photo to our desk associate of the Incest you claimed to have found in in your room, the photo we saw was clearly not a photo taken at our property, we apologize for your confusion in in this. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the room you had been in was just completely renovated and nothing in the photo you provided us shows any similarity to one of our rooms.
