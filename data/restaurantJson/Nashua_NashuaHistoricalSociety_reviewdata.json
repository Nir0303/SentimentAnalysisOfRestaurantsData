Some of the dioramas and artifacts relate to Nashua but only obliquely.  the staff is relatively uninformative and the whole place seems consumed with security to the point that you feel watched your entire visit.  Nashua Public Library is a better resource for things historic in not only Nashua but the area.  the Nashua Historic Society misses the mark on many levels.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2014-05-13T11:19:29-0400", "location_id": "630639", "id": "205402471", "user": {"username": "robcar603", "user_location": {"name": "Nashua, New Hampshire", "id": "46172"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2012-01", "title": "Good venue for opera viewing", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46172-d630639-r147277457-m11068-Nashua_Historical_Society-Nashua_New_Hampshire.html#review147277457", "text": "While the club fittings are rather old and worn, the auditorium has plenty of seating and very good audio visual equipment for viewing operas on a Sunday afternoon.
