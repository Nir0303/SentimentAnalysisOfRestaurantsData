I now realize I had been seriously missing out. It is easy to miss this seemingly small restaurant as it's nestled in a very unassuming strip mall away from the bustle of the newly built downtown attractions. But inside, it's comfortable and nicely renovated with a lot of seating and some warm, colorful touches in the simple but attractive decor. The service is impeccable and quick, at least on both weekday evenings we went (once with the groupon, then the second time without). The best thing to bet on, however, is the food. The portions are large as is typical with delis and diners, but the Woodside Reuben, Charbroiled Chicken sandwich, and the Woodside Skillet we ordered on the two visits were each impeccable. The Skillet is on the breakfast menu, served all day, and a flavorful medley of eggs, fresh diced potatoes, peppers, onions and sausage which can be replaced with turkey sausage on request. Replacements were happily accommodated (we had several!). A strawberry milkshake ordered for our toddler was served in an enormous served freshly hand spun, complete with extra ice cream on the side. The Reuben was the highlight--the ingredients were all basic, but the beef was deliciously seasoned and the rye fresh and hot. Couldn't be better. The seasoning in the charbroiled chicken was also just right. The fries are crisp and batter-fried, served piping hot and delicious--the servings are very liberal and the three of us were easily able to share one order of fries.\n\nA very nice touch is the complimentary pickle bar, which you don't usually find. About half a dozen varieties of pickles and pickled salads were for the taking, and added great flavor to our meals each time. \n\nDefinitely a five star rating for a place that has maintained its edge in a neighborhood that has no dearth of eateries...and done it the old-fashioned way: no bells and whistles, just awesome food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-10-22T11:43:06-0400", "location_id": "3512788", "id": "181987219", "user": {"username": "MadihaQ", "user_location": {"name": "maryland", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "okay for breakfast", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41353-d3512788-r157054385-m11068-Woodside_Delicatessen-Rockville_Maryland.html#review157054385", "text": "Rockville is unfortunately known for its dearth of breakfast and brunch restaurants.  We had not had a lot of luck before with Woodside deli, but we had a coupon and decided to give it another whirl.  We went around 9 on a Saturday morning and were a littel concerned that the restaurant was pretty empty.  Since we had complained before about lousy service, this quiet worked to our advantage.\n\nWe seated ourselves in a nice booth.  Hubby ordered coffee and when I inquired about types of hot tea, I was told on the the plain stuff was available, but that  they did have a chai latte.  I had never had one before, but in a word, it was yummy.  Frothy and spicy with some cinnamin sprinkled on top, it might become my new favorite morning drink.\n\nThe entire menu is identical to the other two restaurants named Woodside Deli (Silver Spring and Germantown) but it is important to note that there is no relationship between the 3 restaurants, just the menus purchased from the original (Silver Spring) location.\n\nHubby ordered his favorite - a breakfast burrito and I had a Belgian waffle with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a side of bacon.  The waitress automatically brought butter and syrup (which I did not need) before my waffle arrived as well as extra napkins which came in handy. Once she saw the waffle and ice cream together the waitress thought it might be good with some whipped cream which she brought in a separate dish.\n\nThe burrito was pretty close to the same as at the other restaurants but a little spicier.  The waffle was nice and crispy as was the bacon.  The ice cream had crystals in it, so probably could have been handled more carefully.  Coffee refills came often, but the extra salsa my hubby asked for was never delivered.\n\nParking here is pretty nasty.  You must enter through a gate located to the side of the strip stores, and then either pay, or validate (2 hours free) your ticket inside.  Lost tickets are charged the maximum rate payable by credit card on the way out of the lot.  You can only make a right turn from the parking lot, which leads you away from downtown Rockvillle, so you have to circle around to get just about anywhere else\n\nI am not sure I would come back on a busy night if for no other reason than the difficulty parking, but the food was okay and reasonably priced.  Service was considerably improved over our last visit.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-04-08T09:28:31-0400", "location_id": "3512788", "id": "157054385", "user": {"username": "mrsphud", "user_location": {"name": "Rockville, Maryland", "id": "41353"}}}]}
