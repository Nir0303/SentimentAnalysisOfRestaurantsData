After having stayed in a few less than impressive Indian-run motels, I checked the room thoroughly before committing. I was pleasantly surprised as it was very clean and the maintenance appeared to be up to scratch and the tariff was only $47.\nI returned to reception with the manager and proceeded with the booking. Upon completion, I went to go outside, only to see my husband in our car surrounded by a number of police vehicles. We learned very quickly that there was a drug and prostitution problem in that motel (and in fact all along the boulevard in that area). The police warned us not to stay and we certainly needed no encouragement to move on. The manager was upset about the claims the police were making, but did not hesitate to cancel my booking and credit card transaction.", "helpful_votes": "9", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2011-07-11T22:46:20-0400", "location_id": "2195948", "id": "115270511", "user": {"username": "bcmegan", "user_location": {"name": "Thornbury, Victoria", "id": null}}}]}
