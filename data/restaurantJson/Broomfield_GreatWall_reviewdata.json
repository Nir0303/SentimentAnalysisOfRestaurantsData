Nobody to greet or seat, just a buffet room with no signage other than the price for the buffet. So, I sat myself. And watched the owner check tables, passing me by numerous times without any acknowledgment. I finally reached out to him and asked for a water. The buffet was picked over and nearly empty. I took a pork eggroll, a wonton,  and soup thinking they would fill the bins shortly. 20 minutes later, they brought out a fresh tray of Krab covered with Cheese. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting, no additional food forthcoming. The eggroll was room temperature so I was leary of eating it. The krab wonton was so stale I am sure it had been sitting there since yesterday.  I finally just left, didn't pay for anything since so little was available to eat. YUCKY. won't be bothered to try again as the owner couldn't be bothered to even pretend to be in the restaurant business.

Great Wall is a \"hole in the wall\" type of place; only a few tables and absolutely NO atmosphere whatsoever. There is seating but I wouldn't want to sit there and eat. The food was REALLY good though (we ordered Egg Foo Young and Chicken with Eggplant and garlic sauce; I would order both again). The only reason I didn't rate it higher than Very Good is because both dishes were too greasy. I would imagine one could request less oil be used? Despite that we will continue to get take out there and pass on closer restaurants. We had enough food for 2 meals each, and the total bill was only $17. The Egg Foo Young was probably about the best we've had actually, and the gravy was good too.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-12-25T12:00:25-0500", "location_id": "4427419", "id": "245852525", "user": {"username": "madmac", "user_location": {"name": "Broomfield,  CO", "id": null}}}]}
