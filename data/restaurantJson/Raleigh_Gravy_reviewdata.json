Gravy is amazing! We were a few minutes late because we couldn't find parking, but I had made a reservation and sooo happy I did. They were full and people were still coming looking for a table or putting there name in. I started with risotto balls and they were great. The sauce that they sit on is a perfect complement to the tastes of the risotto. I had a Raspberry Limoncello Martini. It was delicious! If they ever decide to bottle and sell their house made limoncello I will ask to have it shipped to me! It made the martini so fresh and perfectly blended. My husband had a Perroni, he wasn't to pleased because it was a bit skunked but that happens with Imported beers. \nFor Dinner I had the Gnocchi with 2 types of local mushrooms, truffle oil and a delicious cream sauce. My husband had the chicken parm. My husband ate most of it but saved some so he could have more later at our hotel. I also ate most of my gnocchi, very rich and I also brought some back. We then ordered 2 more martinis and toasted to our 9yr anniversary! We were chatting and I was really enjoying my martini and our very lovely waitress brought over 2 desserts and said happy anniversary, it's on me. I thought that was a very nice gesture but unfortunately so wasted on my husband and I. I have a bit of a lactose issue and my husband doesn't really eat dessert. We both had a small amount of each. I would have eaten both if I wasn't planning on going out after dinner. Amazing, the cream was so light and airy. I can't remember what they were but I did include pictures!
