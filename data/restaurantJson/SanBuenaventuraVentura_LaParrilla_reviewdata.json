Two brothers run the front of the house while their parents run the kitchen.\nThe food is always fresh and unique in selection and style! The primary focus on food comes from the Yucatan, with accents of Mayan cooking. They serve lunch and dinner with everything from Ribeye Steaks, Carne Asada and Carnitas to Tri Tip, Tamales and Fish Tacos. The food is fresh and a wonderful value! The service is warm, hospitable and friendly! The best indication of it's quality is the very large number of Mexican families dining there every day!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-26T18:07:37-0400", "location_id": "6108910", "id": "397725072", "user": {"username": "Dennis J", "user_location": {"name": "Ventra, CA", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Mole Sauce was worth it but....", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60769-d6108910-r360791955-m11068-La_Parrilla-Ventura_California.html#review360791955", "text": "Fun to have a Mayan style type of food here in Ventura which of course has many \"Mexican\" restaurants. It was a nice change. \n\nWe went for our first time tonight and had a very nice young man as our server. (Didn't get his name. Young, very tall, thin, dark hair. Great smile, thanks!). \n\nThe food was good but I removed one star as the restaurant is a bit cluttered and cleanliness seems to not be a priority. I feel this should become a TOP priority as the lack of pride in their surroundings does take away from their tasty recipes. \n\nMy husband had the Enchiladas de Mole (chicken). I had the Enchiladas de Camaron (of course that is shrimp) but asked them to substitute the ranchero sauce for their mole on my dish. It was very good!!! Served with simple rice and refried beans. Nothing fancy on the plates, not even a simple garnish and glad the prices were only $9.95 & $10.95 as that was all the plates were really worth. \n\nI would go back for a mole dish but I don't know if that's enough to draw one in.

It is located in a funky strip mall in Ventura, close to the mall.  Anyway the food was OK but nothing distinguishing this place from any boring Mexican restaurant.  No homemade salsa, no homemade corn tortillas, nothing special about this place.  We shared nachos which were covered in canned re-fried beans, a bland cheese, canned Jalapenos, and bland pico salsa.  We didn't finish them and didn't even take the leftovers home.  We did not get a breakfast menu so I assume you have to get here early to have breakfast.\nI ordered chicken Mole enchiladas, the mole sauce was ok, not sweet and not spicy at all (which I favor) and the chicken inside was very dry.  My husband ordered Chile Verde which he enjoyed, at least he took home the leftovers.   We decided that this restaurant was not the kind of Mexican place we would return to, especially since we are comparing it to Casa di Soria!
