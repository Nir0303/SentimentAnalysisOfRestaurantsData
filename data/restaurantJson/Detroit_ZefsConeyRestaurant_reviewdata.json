I also was a devotee of the generous breakfasts. When I saw the newer Zef's in Midtown, I had to give it a try.  Parking is problem due to the light rails construction but I found a space across Woodward.  The restaurant is a simple affair with tables, booths, but little in the way of decoration.  I opted for the Western omelette and wasn't disappointed.  Since I had recognized the manager from the old Zef's I struck up a conversation and discovered that the original Zef had left the business and she had picked up the new location after recognizing the potential. Once the light rail construction is finished, hopefully business will pick up.  The newness of the operation is reason for the three star rating.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-04-26T16:39:12-0400", "location_id": "4398186", "id": "268185233", "user": {"username": "arjudd", "user_location": {"name": "Birmingham, MI", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2013-04", "title": "Gross", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42139-d4398186-r196649928-m11068-Zef_s_Coney_Restaurant-Detroit_Michigan.html#review196649928", "text": "I work in the building and tried Zef's one time.
