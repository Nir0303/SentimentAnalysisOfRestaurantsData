At this visit we met up with several of our friends that we have not seen in years & had lots to talk about. The staff did not give us any feeling that we were overstaying our time at the table on the contrary they were most friendly. The food portions are quite large to the point I don't think any of us eat all our breakfasts. I do not know if they still do but years ago they always opened on Christmas day which was both rare & convenient should you not have a place to go & you did not want to cook.
