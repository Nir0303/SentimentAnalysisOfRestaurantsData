Crust just crispy enough, fresh sauce and homemade sausage....all six of us loved it! Good local craft beer selection. Atmosphere was cool and the servers very friendly. Definitely recommend if in the area.

At last, there was silence at a pizza restaurant when we ate at Rosalee's on a recent Wednesday.\n\nThe live music was great and the food was even better. Since my partner got busy sucking down pie and garlic knots- without a single complaint, I got to enjoy the busy village pizza joint atmosphere and a couple of excellent slices. The crust is \"just right\" - not oversalted, not doughy, crisp, the perfect balance between chew and bite-through. The tomato sauce taste fresh and real and leaves plenty of room for every other flavor.\n\nWe've been back a couple of times and picked up a pie to take home - absolutely consistent in quality and awesomeness each time! Also tried the sausage knots - a MUST have!!\n\nYay - finally - New York pizza in Longmont.  Get there!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-06T15:44:17-0400", "location_id": "7990593", "id": "389909534", "user": {"username": "JenniferMK", "user_location": {"name": "Boulder, Colorado", "id": "33324"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-07", "title": "As advertised", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33527-d7990593-r388294557-m11068-Rosalee_s_Pizzeria-Longmont_Colorado.html#review388294557", "text": "Went based on the reviews and I couldn't be more impressed.
