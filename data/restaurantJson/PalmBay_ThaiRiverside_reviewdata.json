It was recently renovated, and friends recommended it to us.  We went for dinner, three adults and a four and a half year old.  When you open the door, the river is right in front of you.  Everything is sparkling clean and new.  All the familiar Thai fare is there, from sushi selections, to the curries I love, and everything in between.  The staff was very friendly, and brought out a fun set of child's chopsticks for my grandson.  We had a vegetarian sushi boat, a sushi boat, nice hot red curry, and a child's fried shrimp plate.  All of us enjoyed our entrees.  Price wise, this is in line with every other Thai restaurant in our area, that is to say, very reasonable.  What you do get here, that you don't anywhere else, is the literally stunning views from your table.
