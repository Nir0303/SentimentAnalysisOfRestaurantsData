They came exactly as ordered, the meats were tender and fresh, the bread was also moist and fresh.  It was kind of funny in a way, when the gave us the sandwiches, wrapped in the traditional deli paper, they looked really small and flat and our first thoughts were for average priced sandwiches, these are really skimpy.  However, when we tore open the paper, they were really generous with the meats.  While they still weren't the biggest deli sandwiches I've ever had, they were certainly ample and did not leave us hungry.  As a matter of fact, they were just the right amount.\n\nAlthough we didn't order any sides, the salads looked very good!

I've never personally tried the lemon bars, but a close friend tells me they are heavenly.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2013-02-19T08:48:45-0500", "location_id": "858752", "id": "152549175", "user": {"username": "Lauren S", "user_location": {"name": "Sacramento, California", "id": "32999"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2012-11", "title": "Best Davis sandwiches!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32283-d858752-r146183826-m11068-Zia_s_Delicatessen-Davis_California.html#review146183826", "text": "I drive from Vacaville to get a sandwich at Zia's in Davis - enough said!\nYou must have the pesto mayo.
