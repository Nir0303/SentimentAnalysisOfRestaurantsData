Intimate, two-level pub. TVs are muted, Musak overhead music was at right volume for conversation. Beats Crickets & even Barnett's in Waco - IMHO.  My guess is live music will prevent casual conversation at tables during music sets but dark wood ambiance & decent pub food is worth the try. And, did I mention, change in policy, NO SMOKING inside.
