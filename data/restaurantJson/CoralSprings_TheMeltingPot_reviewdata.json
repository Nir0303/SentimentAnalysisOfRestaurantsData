Made reservations for a Saturday night 6pm we were seated right away. We had the 4 course deal, it seems they start the cheese fondue in the kitchen now. I was disappointed that they no longer offer the salad or dressing that I loved. (Spinach and mushroom) and the warm dressing that was served with. They did make the salad for me but wasn't the same without the warm dressing. The entr\u00e9e was delicious and the dessert was my favorite... Dark chocolate fondue. Our server could have been more on top of refreshments, but I guess having iced tea, is easy to neglect vs alcohol. To summarize... Was a great evening and I will return.
