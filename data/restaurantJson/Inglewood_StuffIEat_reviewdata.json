We found this restaurant on our search and decided to give it a try. Not sure what it's like on a busy day and what time that would be but we stopped by on a Tuesday around 1pm and there were a few patrons inside. Good for us because we had time to decided what we wanted from the menu and spent very little time standing in line to place our order. By the way, the food concept is Southern Food Vegan style. After finding something that sounded like a good o' home cooked meal and finding something my wife and kid would like we were ready to order. We ended up ordering the Organic Soul Food Platter for my wife and the Lunch Burrito for me. \n\nI haven't been a fan of Tofu but the bbq tofu on the Organic Soul Food Platter made me think that maybe I can go Vegan. I wasn't a big fan of the mac and cheese and the cornbread reminded me almost of a whole grain or bran muffin which was pretty good. I had the lunch burrito which I just couldn't put down. That was one of the best burritos I've ever had. The burrito came with chips which my 3 year old devoured. For drinks we had the Beet Lemonade and water. That was one of the best servings of beets I've ever had. My wife and I honestly weren't sure at first but was itching to order a second drink.\n\nAll-in-all the food was great, and the service was excellent. By the way, the food was so good my wife and I didn't even realize we ate each others orders.

I like to try new things and to support small businesses. Neither of us is vegan or even vegetarian. We shared the carrot croquettes and the soul food platter, with a piece of carrot cake for dessert. The carrot croquettes were really good, and they came with two polenta cakes with gravy. I have no idea what that gravy was made from but it was delicious. That might have been my favorite part of the meal. The soul food platter comes with a nice variety of stuff, including some mac & cheese. I have eaten vegan \"cheese\" before and it's gross, so this mac & cheese was quite a surprise. It was almost magical, because there was none of that weird vegan cheese taste to it. If you like kale, the greens were good. I'm just not a fan of kale or greens in general. The black eyed peas were delicious. The cole slaw and potato salad would have been great if not for the bell peppers. Carrot cake normally comes with a cream cheese frosting, but this was different. I don't know what was on there but it was good. There was pineapple involved. It wasn't too sweet, which made it even better. \n\nThe service was very friendly and good. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The lady who took our order and the man who brought the food to the table were both super nice. When I mentioned to the waiter that the gravy was so delicious, he suggested I return for the biscuits and gravy. \n\nIt's on a block that seems to be going through a revitalization. The surrounding neighborhood is really nice. Across the street is a boarded up old theater; I hope someone renovates it and brings it back to its glory. Inside the restaurant, it's kind of Spartan but not in a bad way. There is a little living room sort of area at the front where you can hang out with your friends and talk, apart from the tables. The art on the walls is nice, and the music is good. Even the bathroom was nice.\n\nIf you find yourself in Inglewood or you need to go to LAX, I would highly recommend a meal here. Even a meat eater like me can enjoy it. I'm looking forward to going back.\n\nThe owner of the place said in the video I saw that she is 64. I found that hard to believe. Seeing her in person makes it even harder to believe. I would guess she's in her early 40s.
