They usually take a couple of minutes to make after you order them.  And when you get it, it's piping hot.  But they are SOOOOOOO good!!  Their muffins and apple turnovers are really good too.  All made fresh every day.  I haven't had their lunch items yet, but that will be my next stop!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-07-05T17:14:43-0400", "location_id": "5007331", "id": "285914761", "user": {"username": "Michelle S", "user_location": {"name": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "id": "43323"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "My go-to skyway sandwich place", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43323-d5007331-r237812105-m11068-Real_Meal_Delicatessen-Minneapolis_Minnesota.html#review237812105", "text": "I appreciate the unique sandwiches available here. The cranberry/goat-cheese/turkey sandwich is one of my favorites as it's something I'd never make for myself at home. \n\nThe line moves quickly, food tastes great, and prices are competitive for downtown-lunch-sandwich prices.\n\nBe aware that there's no eat-in area.
