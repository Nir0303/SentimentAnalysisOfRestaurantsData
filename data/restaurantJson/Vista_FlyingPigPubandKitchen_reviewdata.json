I parked early to walk around Vista a bit, enjoying the sculptures, and taking in all the new pubs, and restaurants.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-06-23T17:49:23-0400", "location_id": "8603876", "id": "385414827", "user": {"username": "Gilbert00", "user_location": {"name": "Vista, California", "id": "33231"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Mmmmm.... pork! and more!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33231-d8603876-r382627562-m11068-Flying_Pig_Pub_and_Kitchen-Vista_California.html#review382627562", "text": "Hubby and I popped out for a quick dinner, heard this place was good, decided to try. For some reason we were expecting bbq... it's not bbq. We started with the heirloom tomato salad - amazing!!!!! He chose the filet mignon, (not on the menu) and I went with our server's suggestion of the pork chop. Both were delicious. We'll share the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Including a beer each and 20% tip our total was $120. Definitely more than we'd usually spend for a quick dinner out, but the food was phenomenal and the service excellent. We really liked the decor, too. Will definitely visit again.

The service is top notch as is the beer selection.  The menu is broad enough and fits all tastes.  This is a true gastropub with a lot of imagination by the chef on the offerings and presentation.  The salads are great as is the pork chop and pork shank.  The burgers looked awesome. The steaks are cut in house and we heard others commenting on how good they were.  This location will have a full bar by the middle of June and that will only make it better ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-29T10:32:19-0400", "location_id": "8603876", "id": "377666913", "user": {"username": "Sam S", "user_location": {"name": "Folsom, United States", "id": null}}}]}
