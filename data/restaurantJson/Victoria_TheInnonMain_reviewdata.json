We stayed in the Travelers Suite which had an adorable little bathroom with two shower heads and a unique striped paint job. The suite was spacious for the two of us. We only stayed one night but it would have been good for an extended stay too. There is a sliding door that could have been closed to accommodate someone sleeping in and another person hanging in the living room area. It seems to have been updated a little from the photos online. Looks nice online but it looks nicer in person. \n\nThe two things I always note about a place (besides cleanliness) is the quality of the towels and the comfort of the bed and both were great. This room had a king bed and a super comfortable mattress topper. \n\nAlthough it's technically a \"B&B\" there is only a small little selection of oatmeal and granola bars for breakfast. This was all fine with us but I just wanted to mention that this wasn't a full spread kind of place.\n\nWe didn't have a problem with noise and felt very safe. Our key ring had our room key and a key for the outside door so we could lock everything up. \n\nSO MUCH better than just staying at a regular hotel!

Perfect location for me as it was within easy walking distance.  The bad part is that most every dining establishment downtown closes at 2pm (even with all the potential customers milling about from the festival -- some would've made a killing had they stayed open).  Instead, the only place to eat or drink was The Pump House, which was an easy $4.70 taxi ride away (or 1.5 mile walk).  The Inn itself is made up of two homes.  My room opened directly onto the outdoor patio and gardens.  There was no breakfast (just continental), so you might be more apt to stay at an actual B&B.  In the 5 nights I was there I never had a single visit from housekeeping.  It would've been nice to have a card in the room to explain this, or warn against throwing your towels on the floor (as I did the first night after showering off the grime from an airline flight), or a number to call if you wanted to receive clean towels.  But, instead, there was nothing and the owners didn't seem to be found anywhere.  Aside from that, the bed was comfortable and linens were clean.  I heard rumors there would be a new Hilton Garden Inn (or equivalent) opening on the same block soon.  If I return to Victoria, that will likely be were I stay.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2013-04-12T11:03:47-0400", "location_id": "2323281", "id": "157533595", "user": {"username": "Writer/Director", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-01", "title": "Love the Inn on Main", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56823-d2323281-r149815819-m11068-The_Inn_on_Main-Victoria_Texas.html#review149815819", "text": "I called the proprietor at the last minute for a room and he was able to accommodate us.
