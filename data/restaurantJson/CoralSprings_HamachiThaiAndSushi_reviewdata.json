It's very well and centric located in Sample Rd. and was very easy to find and drive from the hospital I was working. As I never visited before I asked the waitress to help me with the selection and wouldn't be better. What a delicious!!! The food is wonderful in this place.\nWill be back for sure, the restaurant has a very good ambiance as well.\n\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2016-02-29T13:22:53-0500", "location_id": "3337348", "id": "351967462", "user": {"username": "Efrain A", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
