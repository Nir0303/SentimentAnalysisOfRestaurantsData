The wife and I had a Restaurant.com coupon for this place and we decided to give it a try on our way to see a movie.  We allotted 2 1/2 hours for lunch, I guess we should have planned for longer given what how long it took to get our food and complete our meal.  To start things off, the iced tea I ordered had a large amount of tea grounds in the bottom of the glass so I sucked up a huge mouth full while drinking my tea.  When I brought it to the server's attention, she acted like I was being too picky (she started to roll her eyes until she noticed I was looking right at her) and then she asked if I wanted something else as that was all they had as far as tea.  (No offer to brew a new pot.)  I ordered some soda pop instead and of course, it was horrible.  The mix of syrup and soda water was way off and you could hardly tell it was supposed to be soda pop.  It also tasted like they used local water as it had the sulfur aftertaste that you get from drinking tap water in this area.  Quite a while after this all took place, the server came back and apologized stating that they were changing their menus (but had not done so yet) and some of the food items we ordered were no longer offered.  It took us a while to make up our minds about what we wanted to order instead and then it took over half an hour before we got the salad (which we had previously ordered and was available) and another appetizer.  While eating our salad I advised the server about the problem with the soda pop she had brought me and she did roll her eyes on this occasion and the look on her face said exactly what she was thinking, \"So what?\".  I asked for another iced tea stating that I would just keep my straw off the bottom of the glass and got the same attitude from the server.  The prices and food were pretty good overall however, the service and disorganization is something I wouldn't want to deal with even if I was a local in the area.  It shouldn't take over two hours to eat lunch when most of that time is spent simply waiting on poor and slow service.  I can.not recommend this place to anyone.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-08-14T16:37:11-0400", "location_id": "9757763", "id": "405466277", "user": {"username": "Steven C", "user_location": {"name": "Big Bear Lake, California", "id": "2018261"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-08", "title": "Surprisingly good sports bar food, very friendly", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34379-d9757763-r401095637-m11068-Gil_Rick_s-Largo_Florida.html#review401095637", "text": "$2.50 Shock Top on Tap, Amazingly juicy burgers on fresh brioche, friendly service, lots of tv's, and the food is way beyond what you'd expect in a sports bar.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-08-03T18:22:40-0400", "location_id": "9757763", "id": "401095637", "user": {"username": "SteveHojo", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
