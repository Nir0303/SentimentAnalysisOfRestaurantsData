She then preceded to ignore us and spent the next little while with her fingerrs in her mouth, (very sanitary). We had to go to the bar to ask for our check at which point she was rude and belligerent expecting huge kudos for not charging me for the overcooked burger we didn't eat. The bar manager dismissed us and crumpled our check up because he didn't want to stop flirting with the only other waitress there. \n1. Wait staff has poor sanitation.\n2. The food is too close to Burger King to call itself a good Bar and Grill\n3. The cook/Bar Manager can't cook anything unless its well done,\n4. They simply don't care- at all.\n5. The one decent thing: the fries are okay .\n\nIf you want a killer burger that is worth your time and money, my favorite place is just a block or two away at Riad's.
