The selection is very limited - small batches - so if you have your heart set on something specific - you may face disappointment as they run out quickly. They use quality ingredients and the presentation is perfection. Also, you can special order full cakes and other bakery items. But, and this is big - they have the most limited business hours of any bakery in Tucson. Seriously, I understand that times are tough, but only being open Friday, Saturday and Sunday limits the business. And the hours vary on those days. Perhaps being open from 10 to 6 on all three days would be a better and more consistent choice for customers? I now know to run over before 4 p.m. on Sunday, but I am sure that many potential customers show up at 5 p.m. and are turned away. \n\nSo, if you happen to be in the area when the bakery is open, you will be delighted by the wonderful treats. If you happen by and find them closed and still need to satisfy your sweet tooth, try the ice cream next door at the Cashew Cow. Their hours are more realistic. Hope both of these independent small businesses can survive.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-02T11:35:03-0400", "location_id": "4833741", "id": "295051073", "user": {"username": "M E", "user_location": {"name": "Tucson", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "Look No Further for Cupcakes", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60950-d4833741-r249501794-m11068-Sugar_Sweet_Bakery-Tucson_Arizona.html#review249501794", "text": "Stopped in to try their cupcakes after reading many great reviews.
