I first came here in the early 80's! We have a closer one that we usually go to, but when I came back to this one, I was very pleased and surprised! I have been to ALL the Sizzler's in my large area and have found that they are not all exactly the same. This Sizzler offers MANY more items in their salad bar than our usual one and also offers different specialty drink items that the other did not. It was also more modern and kept up. It has flat screens and prettier decor as well as better furniture. It even has an outdoor dining patio. The staff is very attentive and very friendly. The proximity of this restaurant to the mall in West Covina is probably why they are so on top of their game. Many shoppers come here after shopping and want a good dining experience after the mall rat-race. The entrees are always prepared fresh and if you ever have a problem, their management always helps to fix the problem or correct things in order to make things better. It is usually not busy and we don't have to wait. Try not to go on Fridays and Saturdays in the late afternoon for dinner because it gets VERY crowded. You will definitely wait in line. Also, if it is crowded and you are only a party of two and if you wish more room, INSIST on a larger booth and NOT a cramped little two seat space! That is your right to be comfortable. Aside from that, this is a great location with a very reasonably priced menu. I highly recommend this location for a good lunch or dinner. Try it out.

They had plenty of greens and things for salad.  They had a few types of soup so we got some of the potato soup thinking it was clam chowder.  The actual soup was flavored wonderfully but the potato's were a bit on the hard side.  The cheese bread, as always, was very good.  A disappointment tho was that they didn't have any chicken wings or anything like that,,,, only taco fixings and fillings and tortilla chips for nacho cheese.  Normally Sizzlers that we go to have chicken wings, meatballs, pasta and sauce, plus the taco filling and tortilla chips.\nThe best part of the meal was a baby girl that was with a family a few tables away.

Most other places, I'm able to order it rare, but not here. Medium rare is what I order here. My son thought he would give it a shot and ordered rare, and it was just far too red.

After waiting in a long line to place our order, the cashier stared at the e-mail for a while and then told us that she had to check with her manager.

Licking their fingers and putting the top of the syrup containers in their food that has already been partially eaten. Everybody sees it happening and keeps silent.
