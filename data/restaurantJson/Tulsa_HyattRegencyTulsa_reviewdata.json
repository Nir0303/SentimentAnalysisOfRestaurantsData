Glitches with reserved room block and credit card charge", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d488874-r437635429-m11068-Hyatt_Regency_Tulsa-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review437635429", "text": "Let me preface this by saying we were given some Hyatt points in recognition of the challenges we experienced, which is appreciated. However, I feel it is my responsibility to make others aware of some of the glitches so they can be extra vigilant if they do choose the Hyatt for their guests.  The Hyatt Regency knows it is the only game downtown to host events of a certain size, so perhaps the market competition is not there to motivate them step up their game.  But judging by the Trip Advisor reviews of late, and our experience, it does need to step up its game.  Does it want to be known as a tired-looking hotel with hit and miss service, or as the top of the brand? \n\nWe booked a block of rooms for our event guests.  There were many glitches with the block.  I'm not sure if this is a technology issue on Hyatt's part, lack of communication between departments, or user error.  I know of at least one guest who used the designated link to book the block rate yet got the regular rate.  This was fixed but indicates, as with some of the other glitches, that the block was never properly designated.  Then the block was closed prematurely--the contract stipulated that we had up to a certain number of nights, yet when less nights had been booked than the number specified in the contract,  we were told it was closed.  My husband essentially got a blank stare / brick wall when he kept asking about the number promised in the contract to the group sales represenative.  Also, some of the people who booked through the block did not get their welcome bags.  Look, we know Tulsa is not a top-choice destination, and thus we were serious about \"wowing our guests.\"  We put much effort and money into some very nice gift bags--wine, gourmet candy, personal notes.  We were told some of the bags had not been distributed because some of the block rooms had not been coded properly. \n\nThere was also a credit card charge error.  Friends hosted a catered event at the hotel.  This was a gift to us and was to be billed to them, of course, since it was a gift (a very, very nice one!)   Well, we got the charge for the catered event on our own credit card. This was awkward because the hosts never intended for us to know how much the event had cost.  How did this even happen?  The person in customer service with whom we first tried to resolve it kept saying, \"you signed a contract.\"  Yes, we signed a contract for the guest room block, not the hosted event.  That event was a separate contract.  So how did the charge for one contract get associated with the other contract?  Back to my original question--outdated technology, lack of communication between departments, or user error?\n\nI am confident that the Hyatt can do better.  I hope that they will identify and fix any underlying problems that contributed to these mistakes so that they do not happen again.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-11-15T14:42:03-0500", "location_id": "488874", "id": "437635429", "user": {"username": "aspiringtraveler2013", "user_location": {"name": "United States", "id": "191"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 1, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Bed bugs in room", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d488874-r437175489-m11068-Hyatt_Regency_Tulsa-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review437175489", "text": "Bed bugs in one bed.

Our 2 queen bed room was on the 4th floor overlooking a lovely little park.  While the bathroom was a bit small, it was well laid out and very clean with wonderfully fluffy and largish towels and washcloths.  The beds were comfortable, though I'd have preferred an assortment of pillows rather than all down.  There was only one chair, the desk/ office chair, but there were nice benches at the end of each bed which made dressing easier.  They had signs up in the lobby indicating that they are about to start room refurbishment.  The furniture did look a bit worn, but not really bad and the painted walls were a lovely soft yellow (I prefer painted walls to wallpaper which shows dirt and often peels) and loved the art deco styling.

I was very disappointed in my stay at the Hyatt Regency in Tulsa for several reasons:\n\nHousekeeping was subpar. I'm all about saving linen but staying at a hotel, I'd expect linens to be changes at least once during a four night stay. That never happened. There were also many surfaces that needed a good wiping down. There's nothing worse (well I'm sure there is) than seeing secret drippings on vertical surfaces. \n\nResponse time was extremely poor. I called the operator/guest services at least 5 times during my stay. A few times I had to call back because there was no answer. That's unacceptable. I called to request a wine opener and a toiletry. An hour later, I called back because no one had come. \n\nThe furniture in the room was not in great condition. The leather chair looked as if Wolverine had taken to the seat cushion. The bench at the end of the bed was torn in at least 2 places. \n\nThe building itself is just old. If you look at the trimming it looks like they just painted over very old wood. There was a suspicious black fuzz in the light fixture in the bathroom too. The headboard was made of linoleum flooring. It was odd. \n\nThe one thing I'll say that was good about the stay was that I needed a microwave and they brought one up to the room. That was the highlight of my stay at the Hyatt Regency. They really need to step up their game.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Sleep Quality", "name": "rate_sleep", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-10-31T19:04:54-0400", "location_id": "488874", "id": "433413036", "user": {"username": "KendraDawnRN", "user_location": {"name": "Vancouver, Washington", "id": "60820"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-11", "title": "Always nice ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g51697-d488874-r433395471-m11068-Hyatt_Regency_Tulsa-Tulsa_Oklahoma.html#review433395471", "text": "I've stayed at the downtown Hyatt several times and it's always nice.
