It was a true artistic experience. We saw a good play, were able to interact with the playwright. The venue is intimate but the small size of the theater makes one feel that much closer and more into the play itself. There is a little \"bar'' serving coffee and snacks during the intermission and a small display of photos depicting the scenes from recent plays. The effort of having a theater in a city like Camden should not be underappreciated and does add another dimension to the experience. The parking can be a bit tricky but not if you come early - you can leave your car near the park. There are beautiful murals near-by. The immediate surrounding seems safe. The tickets were $20 but the parking is free.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-03-17T20:15:05-0400", "location_id": "5279915", "id": "260243046", "user": {"username": "podrozniczka60", "user_location": {"name": "New Jersey", "id": "28951"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Diamond in the rough", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g46340-d5279915-r242560486-m11068-South_Camden_theatre_Company-Camden_New_Jersey.html#review242560486", "text": "Right here in our own backyard, an intimate, professional and very active, up close and personal theater the brings to life classics as well as originals.

Several were set in local South Jersey, particularly in Camden addressing the racial struggle as the ethnicity of the town changed.  The sets are amazing and very professionally done on a shoestring budget.  The theatre is located in the heart of Camden.  Some who aren't familiar with the area may choose not to attend as they are afraid of Camden in the evening.  We never had any problem.  There is a church across the street and we park in their parking lot.  The little neighborhood looks out for each other.
