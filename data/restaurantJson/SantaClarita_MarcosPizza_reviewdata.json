The place seats about twenty , but most of the business is take-out. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. Drinks are serve yourself. Did not have the pizza so I can't comment on that, but we did have the meatball sandwich and the Greek salad. Both were just okay. Not too bad, but not too good either. It was just food. For there being only two customers in the shop, the food took a long time. Oh, and it was way overpriced.
