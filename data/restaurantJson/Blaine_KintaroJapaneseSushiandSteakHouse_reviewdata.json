The 7 of us walked in and wanted to sit out on the patio. As we walked out there and saw that there were not many people and a large table of 10+ people finished with being served and preparing to leave, the server came out and told us we could not sit outside as only one table is set up for parties more than 7. We asked if we could combine two high tables - to which the waitress said she'd ask her manager. I was sure that the MANAGER would say, sure, we will accommodate as we are not that busy.  I was very wrong - the waitress came out and told us we could not sit outside due to reservations - really? People had sushi reservations at 8:15 pm on a Wednesday night? I don't buy it for a second. \n\nWhen we decided to eat inside where all the tables literally sit on top of each other, it was over 10 minutes before the waitress acknowledged us.\n\nI called the next day (today) to speak to the manager about this disgusting experience only to be told she was not in yet and to try back later. I asked if there was only one manager and of course, the answer was yes. So, because it's probably the same manager that told us NO, I figured I'd share my review to a larger audience.\n\nFYI: I am a 30 year native of the community where this restaurant is located and can say with certainty that they don't stand a chance.

The small sashimi slices and bland specialty rolls made for a disappointing second visit here.  The manager was very gracious and recognized me from the previous night, but the sushi was subpar.
