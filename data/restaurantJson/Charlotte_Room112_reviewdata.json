I was introduced to Room 112 by my roommate. I was never a sushi fan before this place, but alas I was transformed into a sushi lover. Everything on the menu is delicious whether it be the california roll, the 112, or the sexy salmon. My point is that I LOVE their food.\n\nBad News, I hate their servers. There is one girl there who does her job, and does it well. But the rest of the  serving staff seem to give a crap about their jobs or their general appearance in front of customers. Tonight we dined (My roommate, his girlfriend and I) and we had the male server who was tall and had a beard. First off, the Server walked up to my table and had his hands in his pockets and greeted us with a \"Sup, can I get you something to drink\". I've been in the food industry since I was 16 and have seen multiple servers fired for not greeting the customer the correct way. After giving us our drinks and taking our orders, the server left our table to go be on his phone for 15 minutes. We had empty glasses and watched as our apps got put in the window to sit. After starting our food, two more servers walked in and proceeded to drink their starbucks, gossip, and play on their phones. As we finished our meal we looked around wondering where our waiter was and noticed he was putting a tie on and watching the news. He also took 15 minutes to deliver our checks after we payed...\n\nMoral of this review. I love their sushi, I will always want it, but I will never dine in again. \n\nHope you guys have a better experience than me!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-08-28T16:08:14-0400", "location_id": "3831649", "id": "304518678", "user": {"username": "Caroline W", "user_location": {"name": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "id": "49022"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Nice place for lunch", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49022-d3831649-r302308177-m11068-Room_112-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html#review302308177", "text": "Visited Charlotte on the weekend and stumble into this restaurant by chance.
