My picky 2yr old loved the pizza, probably because it closely resembled plain cheese.  Only this one was far from ordinary cheese because it had a variety of yummy flavors!  The acoustic guy playing did a great job and was awesome! :)  We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back.

Overall, I enjoyed it, but there are a few things to be desired.\n\nThe food: I thought the fried cauliflower appetizer was very good.  So, off to a good start.  We ordered the Mushroom Pizza, and it was good.  The crust was thin and done just right, the kind you can only get from a real pizza oven.  However, for $17 it was (as mentioned before) on the small side.  We easily put this away (even after the appetizer).  And it\u2019s really a shame they offer a gluten-free crust but charge a full $4 more on top of the already high price.  \n\nThe drinks & service: Stick with beer and wine.  The staff tends to be young (which is fine), but it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t know their way around a bar and the mixed drinks showed.  I don\u2019t blame them, but I do blame the mgt. for not training their team.  If you offer a cocktail menu, then know how to make them, especially at those prices.  Overall service was good, and I think it helped we were seated near the bar.\n\nThe atmosphere: In a nice historic building and rather cozy.  There was a band up front that was playing some nice Blues, and even though we were close, it was not too loud (at least for us \u2013 we could still talk).  \n\nOverall, I\u2019d go back, but wouldn\u2019t plan to be too hungry and would stick to beer or wine.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-01-14T11:15:51-0500", "location_id": "7688930", "id": "340050808", "user": {"username": "TXtraveler67", "user_location": {"name": "Austin, Texas", "id": "30196"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Super thin crust pizza", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g56584-d7688930-r338329842-m11068-Fire_in_the_Hole_Stone_Pizza-Round_Rock_Texas.html#review338329842", "text": "Walked in early one evening...

My cousin lives in nearby Hutto so he brought my husband and I here for a real treat.  We got two varieties and both were delicious.  This is not your \"run of the mill\" pizza joint.  Everything about is top-notch.

After checking out some pizza chains, which were either closed, or just take out. We found this place, situated in a downtown area of Round Rock. Small storefront, but great food, beer, and friendly service. D\u00e9cor is pleasing with some repurposed items that are pretty cool. We had the Mexican pizza, which was very different, and very tasty. We tried some Octoberfest brews, and thoroughly enjoyed the d\u00e9cor and friendly helpful service. Would recommend this restaurant to all who like to try some unique, gourmet pizzas, in a rustic comfortable atmosphere. We'll certainly return if we're ever in the area.
