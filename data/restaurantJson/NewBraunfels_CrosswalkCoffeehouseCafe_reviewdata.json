This sandwich would rival the one we had at Huisache with more potobello and mote avacado. I indulged in a warmed-up cinnamon roll smothered with pecans & yellow raisins . . . Really good.

Worth another trip in spite of the following service drawbacks.\n\nMusic was a bit loud for our taste.\n\nClerk did not offer a receipt and I forgot to ask.\n\nMy wife asked for tomatoes on side, but she didn't get them.\n\nI asked for their raspberry iced tea, but it tasted like regular.  If it was raspberry, they short-changed the flavoring, big time.\n\nOnline menu says: \"Roast Beef says Served hot, sliced thin & piled high!\"  \nI understand \"piled high\" is undefined. but was a bit disappointed in the amount of roast beef on the sandwich--only because of the menu claim.\n\nYes, will visit there again.  \n\nThere is another location out past the 337 Loop.
