Out of 50 games... At Least 20 were broken , unusable or had some people leaning on it who thought YOU were rude for asking them to use the game! Kids running around physically hurting other kids with no parental supervision. Only 1 person running the prize counter and I would have to say at least 15 kids, families or groups standing around waiting to get a prize. No thank you, we took our few tickets we actually did get.. to go. I typically go to the Boca Raton location and I will continue to ONLY go to that location! \nNote to parents...

Cheese in Sunrise.\n\nWith a printable coupon online, for about US$30, we get a large pizza, four drinks and 100 tokens. This is not necessarily a great deal as the food here is just average and I think over-priced.\n\nHowever, I am not here for the food and no one should seriously come here to eat. We are here for the fun and to watch our grandson have a good time and run around like a mad man.\n\nAlthough this is a place for kids, adults can have a good time too. Racing each other as we chase down bad guys or trying to solve a \u201cWheel Of Fortune\u201d puzzle for silly tickets that are exchanged for cheap prizes is exciting for us.\n\nThe employees here are nice and in my opinion seem to enjoy what they do. I was also surprised how clean the play areas and especially the bathroom facilities are kept.\n\nEven if it is a little on the expensive side and the food is not the greatest, for what Chuck E. Cheese claims to offer, I think this location does a pretty good job.\n\nI had a fun time and no doubt so did our grandson.\n\n \n\n .", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-03-31T12:18:51-0400", "location_id": "466024", "id": "156176551", "user": {"username": "DMBTraveler", "user_location": {"name": "Miami, Florida", "id": "34438"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2011-11", "title": "Don't go for the food...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34667-d466024-r123307575-m11068-Chuck_E_Cheese_s-Sunrise_Broward_County_Florida.html#review123307575", "text": "The food is terrible, the only way to describe the pizza is cardboard with ketchup and shreded generic american cheese.
