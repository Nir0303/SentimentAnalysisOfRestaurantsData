I must say, that the fish plate and the chicken plate portions were plenty. We placed our order at the counter, received our drinks/cups, and went to find a table. The drinks were advertised in the menu as Pepsi products, but when retrieved by the clerk, were actually Coke products (my preference, anyway). The soft drinks and water were bottled and the ice water, lemonade, and punch drinks were dispensed at the back of the restaurant. Our food arrived hot and was, for the most part, very tasty. At least the fish, chicken wings, and slaw were all very good. The GF crust was amazing! We both agreed that the fries, although hot, weren't very good. Ours were not seasoned at all, and there was a 'mix' of 'fresh' fries and 'darker' old fries. Along with being limp, there was no taste. Not impressed with them at all. By the time we sat down at our table, there was a line from the order counter, out the front door. This was definitely the place to be on a Friday for lunch. The atmosphere was enjoyable. The music was not overpowering, nor were the TVs too loud. The counter staff young lady (with a 'high & tight' haircut) was VERY cordial, and walked around the restaurant checking to be sure everyone had what they needed. She 'was' the PR for the restaurant! I would come back just because she seemed to genuinely care for her customers and their experience. Our server, with her short hair and big hoop earrings, was equally cordial and friendly. We will be back whenever we're in town. And, hopefully, to a better batch of fries...

Yo Mama's was around the corner, saw the quaint colorful table and chairs outside and decided to try. Boy are we glad we did!  Beautiful family business,  beautiful environment,  music choice/volume excellent, the vibe there was simply sensational. Someone (s) has paid attention,  put a lot of thought and consideration into this business- the wonderful family.  The owners daughter cane to the table to talk and was genuinely interested in us and our experience. Mama, owner, took the time to come out from the kitchen and greet us as well.  Sorry guys, I'm terrible with names but that's of no reflection on the excellent customer service provided! \n\nOn to the food... Splendid! I had the chicken and waffle with homemade whipped cream and berries. She makes this syrup NOT on the grocery store shelves that I would certainly purchase if it were in my favorite store where shopping is a pleasure (hint hint). Bottle the syrup ladies! Found I didn't need the syrup note the wonderful homemade whipped cream; the waffle stood out on is own and melted in my mouth before I could chew it!  Six good sized chicken wingettes, fried just right,  tender, juicy and flavorful. I've had this meal at several eateries, don't dismiss it because other eateries are doing it.  That would be a mistake,  this is by far the best I've had and we eat out regularly and all over the country... Hubby had the chicken salad on croissant with chips and fresh fruit. Chicken salad hearty and absolutely delicious! Tender,  moist, a myriad of flavors yet wonderfully balanced.  Portion was right on for the money.  \n\nI can't say enough about this place.  Stop in and enjoy!  If I were local,  I'd be here weekly. Can't wait to go back.  I really felt as though I was at Yo Mama's lol! \n\nShameless plug... visit Charm across the street. Bought a beautiful antique ring in there.  Has some beautiful pieces.  Owners a little potty mouth but if you can get past that,  you won't be disappointed!", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-04-26T05:29:49-0400", "location_id": "6778122", "id": "367779725", "user": {"username": "SERETHA P", "user_location": {"name": "Montgomery, Alabama", "id": "30712"}}}]}
