We stopped into this downtown location on a workday and the sidewalks were devoid of anyone who appeared to be minimally employed in gainful work. As a visitor to Sioux City, perhaps this is how downtown works but, if so, it's depressing to the point that it perhaps influenced our feelings about eating in the area. \n\nThe soft shelled crab was fairly fresh and nicely cooked and presented. This was the high point of the meal. The sushi styles were presented well but not of notable quality so cannot be recommended. Beer was cold which is always a plus.\n\nThe decor is small town restaurant-esque with residential kitchen tables and chairs. No feeling of a sushi operation is presented or even attempted to imply something special is going on.\n\nNot sure why there are so many places like this that deliver the bare minimum to be average but perhaps the public isn't demanding better quality in product, surroundings, and service.

Okay - it's not exactly Tokyo or NYC (or even Cleveland) - so all of that could be forgiven if the sushi were fresh, tasty and served with a smile.

The sushi bar fridge was a discombobulated mess - all different types of fish sloppily piled on top of one another. I think this guy would have been jailed in Tokyo!\n\nThe rolls were not well made, the sashimi and sushi unevenly sliced - and none of it was all too fresh or tasty. It kind of reminded me of what a run-down Chinese restaurant trying to cash in on the popularity of sushi would come up with.\n\nWhy not just one star?
