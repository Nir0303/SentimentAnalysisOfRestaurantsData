He and I met in Dallas and he introduced me (and my family and friends) to FCB. Also, we have lived in most parts of the U.S. where you would expect to find excellent and authentic Chinese food (except for the Northwest). Now for the review: Hands down, this is our absolute favorite Chinese restaurant. The only place that can top it is Yank Sing in the Financial District in SF, and that's only for dim sum (like comparing apples and...pears). FCB (both Garland and Richardson locations) offers top notch Chinese dishes, some with a French or Vietnamese flair as the owners are Vietnamese. Take for example the Parmesan-Crusted Prawns: heaven on a plate. And we always order more than one plate because everyone loves it. The Tangerine Beef: tender steak with a sticky-sweet sauce that you will want to dip everything in. Be sure to order it spicy. Salt-and--Pepper Shrimp: delicious and tender prawns with the perfect crunch and amount of chiles. The Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup: oh man - so good on a cold evening. Okay, so they don't take credit cards. Who cares? And exactly what type of \"sides\" do you really expect to find in a Chinese restaurant? Mashed potatoes? You get RICE. WHITE RICE if you're really going native. If you need a side, order some of those heavenly Garlic String Beans. The are the perfect accompaniment to every dish. And don't forget Pan-Fried Noodles.
