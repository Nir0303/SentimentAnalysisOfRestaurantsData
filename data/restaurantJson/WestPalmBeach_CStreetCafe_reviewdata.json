Then had a break in the morning and didn't want to wait around in my hotel, so packed up my office and brought it to the C Cafe.  People are friendly, and it's really what a Euro style cafe is all about. Great ambiance inside, and if you have prefer to sit outside, you get a seat on the sidewalk to watch the people stroll by.  \nI had an omelette as well which was delicious.  \nI tip my hat to the management for such a great spot, and only wish every place I went had a small quaint little cafe like this.  \nAlso much quieter than the starbucks down the street.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-01-27T05:53:59-0500", "location_id": "7304408", "id": "251260011", "user": {"username": "Scot G", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-01", "title": "the best coffee in wpb", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34731-d7304408-r248374264-m11068-C_Street_Cafe-West_Palm_Beach_Florida.html#review248374264", "text": "I recently discovered C Street and I haven't been to Sbux since.\nThe coffee is the best, the muffins and baked goods taste like they are home made.\nThe staff are very friendly and eager to please.

All very tasty and the coffee was superlative. The room is large, muted tones reminiscent of a Paris cafe and the large wall mural of an autumn leaf strewn paris park with benches echoed a real bench in the room.
