I'm not a relative or friend, just an addicted customer who has been coming with my kids from their first weeks in business.

Prices are very reasonable: $2.50 for a small (probably 6 oz), $3.00 for medium and $3.50 for a large. The building is very modest and painted plain white. There are a few chairs and a bench inside but no tables. The air conditioning was running and the shop was cool. There is a large driveway and a medium  sized parking lot behind the building. It would be nice to have some picnic tables or benches outside. Located just north of I-80 and just south of 173rd Street on the west side of Calumet/ US 41, it is very convenient for quick stops.
