I ALWAYS go here when I am working in town (only every other year) but I avoid the namebrand coffee places and go to this local shop. I ordered a nonfat mocha and it was made in front of me but the lady was not friendly at all. A barista should be a morning person (although it was 7:30 a.m., so not that early) She didn't say Thank You, which I think is standard for every shopkeep, big or small. I took my drink and sipped it a few blocks away as I was walking to the Capitol. It was horrid! It tasted like chicken noodle soup. I guess the milk was sour; I am not sure. But I dumped it out and walked into IkeBox and received a much warmer reception and much much better espresso. Will never go back Crema (not that they would care or notice)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-03-18T08:52:39-0400", "location_id": "4477735", "id": "356567012", "user": {"username": "bexnate", "user_location": {"name": "salem, oregon", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Good coffee, good price", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g52053-d4477735-r354662313-m11068-Crema_Coffee_Brewtique-Salem_Oregon.html#review354662313", "text": "Central location in strip next to Equitable Center. near Nordstrom and Macy's, with pleasant inside and sidewalk seating.

It's tucked away in a beautiful little courtyard across from the Salem Center Mall between Bank Of America and Love Love Teriyaki. The coffee and bubble tea are amazing! Their baked goods are all baked fresh in house. They have a huge selection of grab & go lunch items as well as daily drink & lunch specials! The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and the staff is always welcoming! They were super easy to talk to and seemed happy to help or answer any questions I had. I didn't know much about bubble tea when I first found Crema, but the staff were very helpful and informative when it came to deciding what to try from their vast selection. You can tell they really enjoy what they're doing. I really love that they believe in using high quality ingredients and make it a point to support local businesses whenever possible! If you haven't tried Crema yet, I highly recommend you do!
