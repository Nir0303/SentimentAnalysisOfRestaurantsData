I was highly impressed with the great customer service,  food taste and quality of the meat used in the burgers. Great food, fresh veggies to top it off along with condiments. \nI had noticed while we were sitting at the table there was a dried spilled drink on the floor between us and the counter. After ordering our food I went to use the restroom. I was surprised at how gross the toilets were. Not only that, my daughter used the stall next to me. While going to use the trash receptacle she saw a used IV rig in it. Ok so there are things you can overlook, but the last item is unacceptable. I did not get told by my daughter until after we left. \nAdding to that,  when we went to empty our trays at the garbage. There was dried, like overnight or at least a day old, ketchup, mustard and other stuff on the rim of the trash. So my opinion and assumption is (since they only had been open about 35-40 minutes) is that the night crew had not cleaned the place very well. Possibly shorthanded?

We were not disappointed. The burgers are cooked to order, and are grilled, not fried. The Monsoon Burger was truly a treat. It was done perfectly and tasted terrific. And I have never been to a burger place where you chose  your own condiments, and could help yourself to as much as you wanted. The restaurant is very clean and there is plenty of parking.We will be back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-05-01T20:39:17-0400", "location_id": "4403502", "id": "369409545", "user": {"username": "E4468HCjerryb", "user_location": {"name": "Napa, California", "id": "32766"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-04", "title": "Amazing burger", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32367-d4403502-r368319683-m11068-Monsoon_Burger-Fairfield_California.html#review368319683", "text": "Last night in the states, had to try one of the best burger joints in the area. Expectations where exceeded. Ordered a 8oz cheeseburger and some onion rings. Both where the best I've tasted in a long time. Choosing your own condiments might seem a bit strange... But that way you can really fine tune the perfect burger. \nThe meat was excellent quality exactly grilled to my needs. Excellent cook.\n\nWould recommend this to anyone in the area ", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-04-27T18:54:22-0400", "location_id": "4403502", "id": "368319683", "user": {"username": "nl_patrick", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}]}
