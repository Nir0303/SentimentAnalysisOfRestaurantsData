She has WONDERFUL prepared meals to go, and you just heat them. What makes her different is the food is GOURMET at a VERY affordable price. Where else can I get a meal FULLY prepared for around $10-13 dollars for 2-3 servings! The lasagna is AMAZING as is the hashbrown casserole. I found her storefront my strolling down the main street area and can say this was an A-1 Find!! She also has a catering business for larger groups of which if our family picnic is happening this year, I will be using her services!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2015-06-17T20:29:41-0400", "location_id": "7997861", "id": "281033365", "user": {"username": "TravelWII", "user_location": {"name": "WI", "id": null}}}]}
