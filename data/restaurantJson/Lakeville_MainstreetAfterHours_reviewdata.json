The After Hours is the bar part and the coffee shop side has daytime hours. Anyway, the bar part is so nice. Very clean. Lots of wine and beer options. Flights available on wines. The light plate options look really good too. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I like that it's smaller and never crazy busy. It's very clean and it's a great change of scenery from the other dining options on that street.
