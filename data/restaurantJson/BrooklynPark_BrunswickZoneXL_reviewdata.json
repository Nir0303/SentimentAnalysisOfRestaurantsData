The lanes were pretty good and they had a good selection of rental shoe sizes and ball sizes. We ordered the sampler platter and everyone was very pleased. They were actually out of one of the items and showed excellent customer service by making up for it with something else that everyone liked. There is a lot of games for kids, and laser tag (which we did not get to do this time). On the game side, customer service wasn\u2019t nearly as good but it was very clean. We had a great time, and will be back again the next time I am in town. The only drawback, as is in any facility like this, unsupervised teenagers who have been dropped of by their parents.
