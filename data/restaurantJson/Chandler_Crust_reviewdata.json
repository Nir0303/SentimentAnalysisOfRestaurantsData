My only drawback is it was served on a wood cutting board.  I just don't know how sanitary you can get wood boards?\nMeatball sliders were awesome.\ngreat happy hour.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-02-23T14:24:45-0500", "location_id": "8726654", "id": "350383265", "user": {"username": "phxaz54", "user_location": {"name": "Phoenix, Arizona", "id": "31310"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Good Food, Good Prices", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31190-d8726654-r349666438-m11068-Crust-Chandler_Arizona.html#review349666438", "text": "We have had the Crust pizza at the ballpark but had never eaten at the restaurant.\n\nWe went for lunch and were immediately impressed with the specials--- both the variety and the prices.\n\nMy wife had the pizza and salad special; a choice of Caesar or Garden salad and a slice of pizza.  She also had a glass of Malbec wine ( price $5 ) and it was a nice pour.\n\nI had penne pasta w/ meatballs and it was a very healthy portion and came with a side roll.  Since I didn't know they also served Sicilian style pizza, I tried a slice of that as well and a soft drink.

He also explained that the dinner portions are even bigger than lunch.\n\nLocated in downtown Chandler, this has an industrial feel and opens to a nice sidewalk seating area.
