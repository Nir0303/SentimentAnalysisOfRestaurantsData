There were nearly 30 of us - JUST WHOVIANS - a more than half of us in cosplay.  From the TARDIS, to the Doctor (pick one), my son as The Master, my as a Red Dalek (wielding a plunger (clean) and whisk), it was a great time!  Originally, we were going to be seated in the back area of the bar by the pool tables, but something happened with the TV (The TARDIS broke it) and so whatever was on the big screen was changed for the group of us that were there.  Which was really awesome!  It allowed us to spread out, commingle, and go between tables and such to meet others we hadn't met before.\n\nJohnny and Sherise (forgive the spelling if it's wrong) were fantastic!  The drinks and food were slow in coming, but it's not like we weren't all going to be there for 2 hours!  Being pub food, it was average, but it still came out hot and was still tasty!  I think there MIGHT have been one other employee I saw every now and then (the cook?) who helped with delivering food items to various tables.
