I asked a friend who lives in Sunrise, FL and they suggested this restaurant for Jamaican food. It was about 8 miles away from us but it was worth the journey. We went at lunch time and the restaurant was not crowded. It is in a shopping strip, not very Fancy but clean and you can sit in and eat. I had Curried goat with rice and peas, my hubby had Cowfoot. I know you may be saying Cow foot, no way but it is really good. The food was very tasty  and hot. The service was great and a drink came with the lunch special which we thought was  a reasonable cost. They have a great menue  and also serve a full West Indian breakfast at the weekend's. My Hubby gave his Thumbs up to Aunt I's", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-06-09T01:03:16-0400", "location_id": "4683170", "id": "381047411", "user": {"username": "esme49", "user_location": {"name": "Smyrna, Georgia", "id": "35266"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": null, "title": "Hungry", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34382-d4683170-r225278908-m11068-Aunt_I_s-Lauderhill_Broward_County_Florida.html#review225278908", "text": "What better way to end the day after a grueling day at the beach?! Yep. That's it. Some Jamaican food. We took a chance and found this spot as they were closing. The lady on the phone was really rude but I'm from Louisiana, nothing new here. Nevertheless, the food was good although the rice and beans were bland but that's fine. I'd give it another try.
