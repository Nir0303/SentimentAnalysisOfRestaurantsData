The whole idea of friends and family gathering for a meal, a drink, conversation and catching a game or two.

Food has always been good (not always great...), with a nice lively setting in the bar for every match/game that patrons want to watch, with a more subdued booth and table dining area for families and older folks out the main area, and an entry courtyard that is sometimes home to live music.\n\nLast year Crown & Anchor expanded the bar, and it's a whole different version of the place only better.  It's cleaner, more alive, food's improved to very good to sometimes great (fresher, more variety, and just plain better), and service is friendlier with more personality.  The larger bar and seating area, the darts and entertainment stage, all make it a more interesting and fun place to be.

My feeling was for one of the Pies that pubs do so well and a pint. well it did not disappoint. I had a Newcastle Ale and a chicken and vege pie and after a soup my wife had the same. \nThe ambiance was fun; the sounds of clinking glasses and pitchers very social and the accents took us across the pond. there are many screens around both the bar and the restaurant as it is a sports environment.\nAs with most country pubs the food is filling and satisfying.
