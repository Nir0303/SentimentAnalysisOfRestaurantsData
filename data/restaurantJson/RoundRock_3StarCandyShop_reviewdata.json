I've tried many of their hand-made selections and I've always been satisfied!\n\nThe shop stocks over 200 bottled sodas (including pretty much the entire line of Sprecher sodas from Wisconsin which are hands-down my favorites). If you don't see what you want, you can choose flavorings to make your own custom soda.\n\nThe ice cream is served in ample portions, usually with a cute gummy candy on top. If you splurge for a fancy sundae, be prepared to be in awe. They're nearly works of art.\n\nThe shop was remodeled in 2016, adding a walk-up window -- though I'd still go inside to take a better look at everything. There are a few stools outside or you can easily take your treats down to the plaza about a block to the east.\n\nThe shop is located right downtown, making it an easy stop for after looking around the other shops or before seeing the bat colony, or as a destination in itself. There's on-street parking plus a free public parking garage that's well-marked.\n\nIn terms of candy, they have everything I've ever wanted and more. My kids enjoy picking bulk candy that might only cost a few cents, but it's also a good spot to satisfy your cravings for nostalgic candy. The candy here is also tasteful -- I haven't seen any inappropriate candies (like some candy shops I've visited in other cities sometimes feature). So, it's like most of Round Rock -- family friendly and home style. Definitely recommended.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-07-05T15:29:51-0400", "location_id": "10520550", "id": "389560147", "user": {"username": "SDSUGRAD", "user_location": {"name": "Round Rock, Texas", "id": "56584"}}}]}
