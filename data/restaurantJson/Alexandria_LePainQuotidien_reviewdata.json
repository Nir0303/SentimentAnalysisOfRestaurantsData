First of all the service is terrific.  Secondly the food is spectacular.  We both ordered the mushroom and goat's cheese omelet and I ordered the fresh fruit too (incredible).  The omelet comes with two \"hunks\" of organic bread--baguette and sourdough rye.  Great!  Good hot coffee and while others have commented that it comes in a pot and is enough for one cup we got several cups from our pot and then had to fight off the waitress wanting to add more to our pot.  I highly recommend this spot for a lovely breakfast on a Sunday morning (or any other day of the week).", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "LePainQuotidien, Guest Relations Manager at Le Pain Quotidien, responded to this review", "text": "Greetings,\n\nThank you for taking the time to reach out to us with your review and for dining at Le Pain Quotidien.

Coffee is excellent and dark but comes in a pot that is too small, only a mug full. Cappuccino, on the other hand, comes in a very big cup and was delicious.
