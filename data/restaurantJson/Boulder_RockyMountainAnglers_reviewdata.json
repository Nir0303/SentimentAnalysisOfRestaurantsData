Guide picked me up at my hotel, took me to the shop to get outfitted. Nice shop with all top notch gear. I'm a novice fly fisherman, so the point of the venture was instructional, but the guide put me on the fish! I had caught four within the first two hours on the water. Great for me. Guide was very informative of my technique, helping gain confidence.

We've since checked out their website, it's over the top, too, and loaded with information.  This shop should be on the Top Ten places to visit in Boulder (for flyfishing enthusiasts, that is).
