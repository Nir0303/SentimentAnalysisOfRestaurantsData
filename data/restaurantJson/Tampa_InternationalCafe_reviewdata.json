Its close by, the food is good and the staff are friendly.  Service is fast although it does slow down a little at lunch time which is to be expected in a busy area like downtown.  After you've been a couple of times, the staff remember you and you'll hear them calling lots of the customers by name.  If you're worried about a wait, you can call your order in.  I love their breakfast cubans and the caramel macchiato is the best coffee I've had downtown.

Everyone new what they wanted and how and I was still reading the huge menu. There were signs everywhere but to be quick I got a sandwich.

I had the ham and cheese on white. It was pretty big too. Got a pickle thrown in the bag as well. \n\nTip: if you're serving jury duty, walk past the subway which is the first thing to the right when you get out of court house. This place is across the street. There is a sign on side of building and then the front where entrance is. So much better than subway and more choices.
