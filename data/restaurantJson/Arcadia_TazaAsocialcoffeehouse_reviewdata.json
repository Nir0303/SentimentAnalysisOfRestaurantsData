I always ask for the Big Gulp size.  At Taza the largest size is a Starbucks small.  2.85 is a lot of cash for a sample size coffee.  \n\nThe coffee itself is very good - bold and strong but not bitter.   Some very  decorative donuts and other pastries looked good but I didn't try any of these.\n\nThe 2 people working were very friendly.  Very small place with no public restrooms and I didn't see much social going on as I and one lady behind me were the only ones there late on a Saturday morning.\n\nWhat's up with a coffee shop not opening until 8am?  Most people have to be at work by 8 so stopping by for a quick caffeine fix here may not be an option.\n\nIf I rated on the coffee alone this place would be a 5 star but subtract 1 for only serving samples and another for outpricing Starbucks.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-02-20T06:43:10-0500", "location_id": "5073019", "id": "349419347", "user": {"username": "purpletiger", "user_location": {"name": "Lexington, NC", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2015-10", "title": "Fantastic cappucinos", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g29105-d5073019-r320539248-m11068-Taza_A_social_coffee_house-Arcadia_California.html#review320539248", "text": "The best coffee we've had in America, made to high Italian standards.
