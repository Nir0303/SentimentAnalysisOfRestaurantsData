I have been coming here with my husband several times a week for a little over a year now. We have gotten to know Eric and he has always been welcoming and charismatic. This morning, my husband and I went about our usual routine. When we came in, the woman behind the counter were helping a group of three gentlemen before us. She saw us come in when we waited behind them. Another man came in behind us and asked if we were \"all set\". We said that we were waiting. I do not know if he took this to mean that we had already ordered and were just waiting for our food or if we had not ordered. Either way, the woman behind the counter took his order before ours. This made me livid! I was not particularly upset with him because, again, he may have been confused. But she saw us come in before him and acknowledged him before us. I was going to order a breakfast sandwich and just told my husband that I would rather pay for our drinks and leave. He persisted that he still wanted to order his coffee. So I waited, while he ordered his coffee. At this time the woman behind the counter asked what he wanted. He told her he wanted a large coffee. Another woman came in and the woman behind the counter not only took that other woman's coffee order but poured it and took her money before pouring my husband's coffee or taking his money. This topped it off for me. As much as I loved coming here, I do not think I will be coming in or at least not if this particular woman is working. She was rude and not friendly at all. We love Eric and the rest of the service that we have received thus far. It is a good place for coffee and breakfast foods, but the service needs some work.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2012-06-04T06:07:55-0400", "location_id": "822172", "id": "131261040", "user": {"username": "ivanymmik", "user_location": {"name": "Worcester, Massachusetts, United States", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "Pretty decent food here...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g41952-d822172-r19436238-m11068-Eric_s_La_Patisserie_Cafe-Worcester_Massachusetts.html#review19436238", "text": "Pretty decent food here for lunch-closes at 2pm.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2008-07-12T11:32:54-0400", "location_id": "822172", "id": "19436238", "user": {"username": "Erin F", "user_location": {"name": "Worcester, Massachusetts", "id": "41952"}}}]}
