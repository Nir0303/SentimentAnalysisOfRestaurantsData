What a let-down.  First off, the waiter was a little rude.  When asked a question, he acted like it was a great effort to respond.  We had to wait a long time to get the bill at the end of our meal, too.\n\nAnyway - - we ordered a Margarita and a Sam Adams on tap.  The beer was fine but the Margarita was pretty weak.  It could have used another shot of tequila. \n\nWe ordered a \"Pick Two Combo\" consisting of a Beef Taco and a Chicken Quesadilla. The quesadilla was placed on top of the taco, turning the taco shell into mush.  Both were simply average and no more.\n\nOur other orders were Jalapeno Poppers, which we rated a 7 on a 1 to 10, and Teresa's Favorite DIP, which was more like Teresa's Favorite SOUP.  It was so thin and watery that  you couldn't really dip anything in it.  If you tried to put it on the flour tortilla they gave you, it was like putting a spoonful of liquid with a few chunks on the tortilla - quite messy!  We intended to ask the waiter if it was normally this thin and watery, but he never came back until we were long done eating and had requested the bill.\n\nOur bill was reasonable - - $39 plus tip.  But the food was so unimpressive that we would probably never return.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-11-04T16:54:41-0400", "location_id": "873955", "id": "434686381", "user": {"username": "LyndaMN", "user_location": {"name": "Apple Valley, MN", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Great Food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g43242-d873955-r432681450-m11068-Teresa_s-Lakeville_Minnesota.html#review432681450", "text": "Stopped on our drive up to Minneapolis.
