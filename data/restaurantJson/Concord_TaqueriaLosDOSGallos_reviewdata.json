I can be full on 1 Chicken Sopes that includes warm fried tortilla chips and fresh pico de gallo sauce from the condiment bar. What I love it that I can add grilled onions from the condiment bar on top of my sopes once it is served from the counter. You order at the register and they bring the food to your table. Sometimes there is fresh sliced oranges or watermelon at the condiment bar that I also have for dessert, no additional charge and of course all the peppers, salsas radish etc that you would expect from a Mexican restaurant included.  With a drink priced under $5, not bad. Having lived in Mexico for 5 years this is one of the  closest to the real thing I have found in CA. It is not 5 star dining, but that comes at a hefty price. But it is a great meal for under 5 dollars so in value it gets the 5 star rating. Fast friendly service, Good food. Never had a bad meal yet.Have eatten there many times and my granddaugther loves the pacman game they have in the restaurant for a few quaters we can play. Both at the Contra Costa Blvd. location in PH or at the Grant street location in Concord. I also like that they have the TV's on typically with futbol (soccer) in Spanish language.
