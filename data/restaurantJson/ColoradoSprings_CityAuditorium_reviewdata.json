Too hot, no air conditioning, very little ventilation or fans, not allowed to sit at the event I went to. I was expecting to sit and since they didn't sell enough tickets (maybe) it was a standing only event. No cold water for sale within 15 minutes of doors opening, Really? you'd been setting up all day and couldn't put water on ice? We left before the first band was finished. Won't come back. No one we talked to that was working that night knew anything about any of these issues or who to call to find out any answers.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2012-08-02T15:57:14-0400", "location_id": "825817", "id": "136095922", "user": {"username": "Wendy S", "user_location": {"name": "Breckenridge", "id": null}}}]}
