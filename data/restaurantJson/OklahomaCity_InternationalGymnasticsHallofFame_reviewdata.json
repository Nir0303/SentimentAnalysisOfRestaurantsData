The place is not downtown! . The Address is wrong!! The location is inside the\nChildren's Science Museum on the 2nd Floor. Down the street from the Softball Hall of Fame building.  Here is the address for your GPS or ask the people at the SoftBall Hall of Fame: International Gymnastics Hall of Fame exhibit  at the Science Museum Oklahoma\n OmniPlex Center  2100 NE 52nd St.  Oklahoma City, OK 73111 . The exhibit is a browe on your event. You get a pass/sticker to place on your shirt at the Museum to go to the 2nd Floor. There is no one there to talk to you not even a security guard. There are a few display cases and few mats and lots of pictures mounted on a wall. This is about a 10 minutes top unless you are a big fan of Gymnastics. This place has so much potential. No other tourists were there. Just some toddlers jumping on the mats.", "helpful_votes": "6", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2014-03-06T15:41:15-0500", "location_id": "117292", "id": "196477084", "user": {"username": "jdreynoldsjr", "user_location": {"name": "Arlington, Virginia", "id": "30242"}}}]}
