On arrival we were escorted to the rear, down a flight of stairs, and into wine cellar and seated there alone. I wondered what we did wrong! But the wine cellar proved to be an  ideal location. We were not distracted by other patrons' conversations and were free to get a little silly from our drinks. My wife had a glass of Cava and I had a Balvenie Doublewood neat. Prices for these were reasonable. The liquor selection was first rate...they even had Pappy Van Winkle (which I turned down as I am saving for retirement).  \n\nI started with the foie gras. It was served on a waffle with thinly sliced peaches and candied nuts in a balsamic glaze. I enjoyed it with a glass of RIesling. The sweetness of the wine was not overpowering and paired nicely with the foie gras. The candied nuts and waffle were also nice, but pushed the sweetness a little far. Still, I enjoyed my starter. My wife started with the butter lettuce salad with strawberries, pink grape fruit, and peaches. She found the salad dressing  a bit acidic for her, but overall she loved the salad. Rolls were brought, tasty and quite buttery/oily, but delicious.  \n\nOur entrees (me): Divers scallops in a cream sauce on a bed of field peas, small pieces of fried okra, and Vidalia onions. I think the menu mentioned rocket, but I didn't perceive any of that in there. My wife got a filet with \"peanut\" (fingerling) potatoes italian pole beans, (quite chewy) porcini mushrooms, and (quite hard) carrots. She loved the steak, but not the veggies. We ordered a nice a fairly priced bottle of Jordan RR Chardonnay which paired nicely with my dinner. My wife likes white wines with anything, so she was happy. Dessert (her) was passable ice cream. I had the hazelnut mousse cake, which I did not love. \n\nService was great. No complaints there. \n\nThe bill came to nearly $300, so not a cheap date.
