My husband got the Enchiladas Rojas o Verdes with beef, wasw tons of beef and not much cheese, I believe it needed more cheese, was still good though. The other order was the Chili Relleno which looked really good and our friend said tasted really good too. Would recommend this place to anyone and will be back. The brunch sounds wonderful, really want to try it.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-07-03T08:17:04-0400", "location_id": "9739289", "id": "388734016", "user": {"username": "altonjk", "user_location": {"name": "Bakersfield, California", "id": "32037"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-06", "title": "Wonderful surprise ", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32037-d9739289-r384101151-m11068-Centro_18_Cuisine_Lunge-Bakersfield_California.html#review384101151", "text": "We were traveling through Bakersfield after a camping trip and stopped by Centro 18 in hopes of getting a table without reservations on Father's Day.

We had heard only good things and those comments proved true. The menu leans to Mexican food with some South American and Puerto Rican influences. I started with a very good house margarita to accompany freshly made chips and an excellent salsa. I had pork enchiladas and throughly enjoyed the most tender pork I've ever had. This dish can be served with a red or green sauce. I chose to have one enchilada with the red sauce and one with the green. Both were very good, though a little too sparse for my liking. My wife had the arrachera con chimichurri - a perfectly prepared (medium rare) strip steak. The chimichurri was excellent. The accompanying jalape\u00f1o potatoes and grilled vegetables were just right.\n\nThe ambiance here is pleasant but not particularly noteworthy. The only thing that kept this visit from getting a fifth star was the service. Our server was very friendly but he seemed overextended. He was constantly on the move but had too many tables to cover. The salsa was served several minutes before the chips, both of which were delayed. My wife's drink was served several minutes before mine. I was asked if I wanted a second drink, but she was never asked. The meal was so good that the service issues didn't detract from our enjoyment of the evening.\n\nBottom line: we'll certainly go back.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2016-02-14T13:10:54-0500", "location_id": "9739289", "id": "347724201", "user": {"username": "Jon R", "user_location": {"name": "Bakersfield, California", "id": "32037"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-02", "title": "Good new restaurant down town", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g32037-d9739289-r346003984-m11068-Centro_18_Cuisine_Lunge-Bakersfield_California.html#review346003984", "text": "A great new place that I hope makes it through its infancy.
