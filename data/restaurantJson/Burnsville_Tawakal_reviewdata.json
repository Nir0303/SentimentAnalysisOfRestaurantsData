On the other end, mostly under the pancake was a fresh, crispy lettuce salad with mild dressing.  I loved the spices, but I couldn't begin to eat it all.  My dining companion had the beef curry, which consisted of cubes of beef with a bit of bone still attached. I think it is made to be eaten with the fingers.  It  was a bit chewy. That dish came with delicately flavored rice.\nWe ordered mango juice, and we were brought a large pitcher of it to share.  It was absolutely delicious.\nContrary to another of the reviews, there is table service.  The server was polite and helpful, but I did have a little trouble understanding him. I see that as my problem, but be prepared to use your best listening skills.\nThis is not fine dining, this is an informal neighborhood caf\u00e9.

Ethiopian, Kenyan, Djiboutian--I love it all. When I heard that the Twin Cities metro area was host to a huge Somali diaspora, I knew there had to be some amazing food, and I found it in Tawakal.\n\nThe quality starts with the people. Yussuf, the owner, is one of the most friendly people you're likely to meet. He is able to put people at ease immediately, which is very helpful when dealing with food from an unfamiliar region (as was the case for my 60ish parents and for the 80ish couple I also saw come in for lunch). Even the cooks and busboys here will chat you up and are charming and gregarious; the Oklahoma v. Notre Dame game was scheduled to be on, and they happily changed the TV channel and discussed college football with us. You don't get that at most places.\n\nSo now, the heart of the matter--the food! We started with a vegetable soup which was fantastic. It contained cinnamon, coriander, and a curry base, with mashed potatoes for body. They then add chopped onions and carrots. I resorted to drinking it straight out of the bowl!\n\nThe chicken curry was straightforward and delicious. Nothing fussy about it--heaps of chicken with a fantastic sauce. It was mildly hot, but not such that my Okie father couldn't handle it. The accompanying rice was perfectly cooked and aromatic. I could happily eat that chicken curry every week and never grow tired of it.\n\nThe kay kay was a pleasant surprise. It was extremely delicious (and filling). It had loads of chicken and shredded japati, with an amazingly flavorful sauce. They finished it off on top with the mildest sprinkling of cheese which, oddly enough, really made the dish. You could easily share this between two people and be perfectly happy with your choice.\n\nI didn't order it, but did see a few gentlemen sharing the Sport for 2 dish. It looked fantastic. Should I ever again fins myself within 100 miles of Burnsville, I'm coming back to get it.\n\nFinally, we ordered a single sambusa and split it. It was clearly fried to order (not sitting under some heat lamp), and was piping hot and tender when it reached us. My mother, who scorns all things fried, loved it. Get one.\n\nI genuinely hope that these folks open more locations. Specifically, I'm hoping they open one in Austin, TX, where I live (my parents regaled the owner with how great business opportunities are in Austin)!

The menu offers pictures so that also helped decide on our order. My first choice was to order goat but it was no longer available that evening-the waiter said that many days it is gone by lunch time as it is a popular item. We decided to have a chicken dish with noodles. The waiter brought soup and a pineapple drink along with sambusas. The sambusas, piping hot fried turnovers filled with a seasoned ground beef mixture, were divine! I could have made a meal of the soup and the sambusas-Both were fabulous. This restaurant is small and definitely offers an interesting experience as we watched many clients come and take out foods. Prices are very reasonable and main portions are large. It seemed that the most important part for the waitstaff was to authentically please us, the customers, as you experienced new flavors.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-06-05T06:04:38-0400", "location_id": "3575165", "id": "163069827", "user": {"username": "Barbara O", "user_location": {"name": "San Diego, California", "id": "60750"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-03", "title": "heaven!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42915-d3575165-r155122650-m11068-Tawakal-Burnsville_Minnesota.html#review155122650", "text": "their chai is pure HEAVEN. the \"goat meat soup\" was excellent (where was the goat meat? must have been in the broth or blended. either way, the flavor was just perfect, nice and spicy) i  would have been satisfied to just stop there with the soup and tea. however, i had ordered a tilapia entree, which when it arrived was almost daunting in its portion size, even for me. we all ended up taking some food home and had a great supper that night with leftovers heehee and nice memories of this comfortable down to earth little restaurant. oh, and before we left, the manager gave me a refill on the chai which put me over my caffeine limit i think but a little further still into chai heaven.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-03-19T21:04:06-0400", "location_id": "3575165", "id": "155122650", "user": {"username": "a r", "user_location": {"name": "the hamptons", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-03", "title": "Well worth the adventure!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g42915-d3575165-r154437941-m11068-Tawakal-Burnsville_Minnesota.html#review154437941", "text": "Mysterious blends of spices make these dishes tantalizing!
