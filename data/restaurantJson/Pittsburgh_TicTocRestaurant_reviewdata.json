During my recent lunch I considered a number of cafeteria type items such as meatloaf, chicken pot pie, the tic-toc burger and the \u201ctic toc tea plate.\u201d I settled on the open-faced smoked turkey platter, which turned out to be exactly what was expected: a thin slice of white turkey on a plain slice of white bread, piled atop mashed potatoes and topped with plenty of salty gravy. The quality reminded me of public cafeterias of the 1950s: Warm, filling, and undisturbed by the temptations of culinary nuance.\n\nMy waitress told me that the current incarnation of the Tic Toc, dating from 1958, was moved from its original higher level location to the department store\u2019s ground floor. The restaurant sports a spacious seating area for around 150 people and a sparse but quirky d\u00e9cor that includes a selection of antique clocks along the back wall. I was especially impressed by a presentation of over two dozen historic black and white photos of Kaufmann\u2019s from what looked to be the 1930s, and some even older prints going back to the early 20th century, including a shot of a charming merchant wagon. \n\nThe Tic Toc, in short, is a virtual time machine into its host city\u2019s vigorous past. While I have given the establishment only two stars for its uninspired food, the place is worth a visit to be transported to Pittsburgh\u2019s heyday when Big Steel was king, America was a manufacturing titan and foreign competition was a small cloud on the horizon.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2012-06-07T09:38:27-0400", "location_id": "401139", "id": "131489229", "user": {"username": "RoamWriter", "user_location": {"name": "New York City, New York", "id": "60763"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": null, "title": "...for the ladies.

The wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  I enjoy going in for a bite to eat when in town because of the history of the building (the old Kaufmann's, now Macy's) and restaurant.  I'm sure this establishment was quite a place in the sixties as it really reminds me of a step back in time.  There's still a lunch counter and probably the same one from decades ago.  There are many different clocks on the back wall - a symbol of the restaurant's name.  Many department stores no longer have restaurants inside anymore, but this one sure does and it's great!
