If you look at the menu on the wall, it announces all the varieties of fresh oysters they have on hand for the day. So, I suppose, if I were in the mood for oysters, that would be a good place to start. But, all the  reviews I read raved about their cajun seafood buckets. Unfortunately, in my party, no one wanted to go for the bucket and I needed three takers to join me. So, I went for a pound of fresh crawfish. They have all types of sauces you can get and all levels of \"heat\" you can get. I opted for the Shackie sauce (basically everything) and at a medium level of heat. I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED! Thank God Kevin, our waiter suggested that I get a side of rice to pour the drippings from my crawfish over. That was the best way not to waste a truly great taste experience. One other in my party ordered the Mahi Mahi, which looked about average to me. But, another ordered the garlic noodles with everything and that also was awesome! This is one of those places where you just say to yourself when leaving that you MUST come back and dive deeper into their menu as there are clearly some treasures well worth exploring.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-04-24T08:06:29-0400", "location_id": "2536405", "id": "366881445", "user": {"username": "Jim C", "user_location": {"name": "Anaheim, California", "id": "29092"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-01", "title": "Fresh and nice dinner", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33260-d2536405-r344415056-m11068-Seafood_Shack-Westminster_California.html#review344415056", "text": "Me and friends come order some crawfish, clam and shrimps.

But the menu includes oysters ($2/each), clam chowder, wings, and garlic noodles.  SS is in on Westminster Blvd, in between Goldenwest & Beach in Westminster.  \n\nFor three of us, we ordered fries ($4); 1 lb of shrimp w/ shack sauce ($10 - MP); calamari ($9); clam chowder ($5 - sorry no pic); 6 fish sauce wings ($6); and garlic noodles w/ sausage, clams & shrimp ($13).  The first thing I noticed about SS is the prices are very reasonable.\n\nThe fries were very good.  The portion was large for the price, they came out piping hot and were nicely seasoned:  4 Stars.  Secondly, the shrimp were also better than average.  They were plump & juicy, and the shack sauce had good flavor w/o overpowering the shrimp:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the calamari was just OK.  They were all rings (and of uniform size), so they were prolly frozen.  I like tentacles!:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the clam chowder was really good.  It was chocked full of clams, and had a nice flavor to it.  The only room for improvement was the broth could have been thicker:  4 Stars.  I heard the wings were good, but the fish sauce ones were very average.  You could taste the fish sauce, but it didn't seem like the wings were seasoned.  Nonetheless, they were crispy:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the noodles were very garlicky, and very tasty.  Despite different cooking times, the seafood was moist & the sausage was tender.  This dish was a good way to end the meal:  4 Stars.\n\nThe service was really good.  The waitress was very friendly as was the remainder of the staff.  In addition, the food came out quickly:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the motif is a bit whimsical, with faux nets, life preservers and fishing rods:  3 Stars.\n\nI definitely want to return and try the oysters, and more Cajun Viet seafood.  I had recently been to Kicking Crab, and I wasn't in the mood for more this evening.  Plus, they have Longboard beer from Hawaii!!!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2014-08-14T10:55:52-0400", "location_id": "2536405", "id": "221830785", "user": {"username": "J P", "user_location": {"name": "Los Angeles, California", "id": "32655"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2013-06", "title": "If you want at great meal at the right price go to Seafood Shack!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33260-d2536405-r163020578-m11068-Seafood_Shack-Westminster_California.html#review163020578", "text": "The freshest seafood, head and shoulders above the rest, hands down, the for real smokin' white hot deal!
