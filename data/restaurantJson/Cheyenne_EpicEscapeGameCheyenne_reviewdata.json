If you haven't, you're in for a treat! We did the \"Clued In\" room (a board game theme) and had a great time -- can't wait to go back for the other 3 themes. Basically, all escape rooms have a setup story about why you're \"trapped\" in the room (you aren't really, there is always an emergency way to get out if necessary) and you have to solve puzzles to find what you need in order to get out within the time limit (usually an hour).  The best part is that you have to discover what to do by just searching and guessing.  This room was just the right level of difficulty for my group of 5 adult newbies and myself (who had done a couple before) -- the staff watches what you're doing through a camera and will give you just the right amount of guidance and hints via a typed message on a monitor or by intercom if you seem stuck or going in the wrong direction.  We made it out in 58:47, just barely in time!  This was a \"moderate to challenging\" room so we are working up to the more difficult ones (you can gauge difficulty by the posted \"success rate\" of teams in the room -- the one we did, for example, has a 32% success rate).  The rooms accept up to 8 people, and I wouldn't recommend trying it with less than 4 because it's very helpful to have multiple people working on different puzzles at the same time.  If you have less than 8 there is also a  possibility you could be in the room with strangers to fill the extra spaces.  That can be a fun way to meet new people -- or it can also be a problem, especially if they are very experienced (and solve the puzzles before you get a chance) OR if they are frustrated because YOU are hogging all the glory (LOL).  Just keep this in mind!  It would also be great fun with more mature teens 12 and up, though it might help to have some adults in the room too.  It takes about 90 minutes start to finish (to learn the rules, practice locks, etc. beforehand and then take a triumphant/consolation group photo after) and you don't need to bring anything other than your brain.  GO!  You'll have a great time and will help keep this great new option for Cheyenne fun going for the rest of us!", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": {"lang": "en", "author": "Jessika_and_Sarah, Owner at Epic Escape Game Cheyenne, responded to this review", "text": "Thank you for taking the time to express your honest opinions.
