The friend we were visiting in Dubuque had been to a neighborhood Gyros place but could not recall the name.  A quick search of the internet offered Zoro.  As we walked into the restaurant, our friend reported that this w2as not the place.  About then, we were rigorously greeted by a Greek sounding & looking man.  Made to feel like old friends we each ordered our choice of gyros & were soon served.  Our food was good but made special by the thickness of the meat slices & the quantity in each serving.  It was good, the atmosphere casual, & the joyful greeting made for a good experience.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2016-11-08T13:11:15-0500", "location_id": "5577474", "id": "435701247", "user": {"username": "folkways", "user_location": {"name": "Georgetown", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Really good food", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g37853-d5577474-r426752640-m11068-Zoro_gyros-Dubuque_Iowa.html#review426752640", "text": "We have been here before, but it had been a long time.
