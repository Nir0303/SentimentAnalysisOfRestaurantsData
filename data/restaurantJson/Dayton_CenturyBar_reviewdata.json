Along one wall is a beautiful lovingly crafted wooden bar with the requisite bar to ceiling mirrors and deco art glass lights in the ceiling. Along the other side are tables made from oak barrels with round tops surrounded by three or four barstools matching those at the bar. There is a larger room in the back, and I headed there because the slightly brighter lights over a table for 8-10 were inviting.\n\nBut after a few minutes my eyes adjusted and I made my way back into the main room to sit across from the bar and be joined by friends.\n\nWhat is great: \nThe ambiance. On a weeknight it is happy but quiet, with a deeply Americana vibe. \nThe bartenders know their stuff cold. But they aren't only extraordinarily knowledgable about the whiskeys and bourbons for which the bar is well known. Those come by the dozen and are lovingly described and poured. \nThey also have a short list of cocktails, and can make whatever you like, though I assume sticking to the classics is going to be your best bet. But they do cocktails the old fashioned, Casablanca/Maltese Falcon silver screen kind of way. Jack and Coke is better made with real sugar cubes for balance\u2026 the Last Word is sweet with cherry and chartreuse but packs a slow punch. And the Amaretto Sour is a must. Made with frothed egg whites atop amaretto and simple syrup, all expertly shaken and poured - with no sour mix- it is perfection. It's all about the craft here. No sprite clumsily topped on amaretto, no lazy lists for amateur mixologists. These guys are the real deal.\nThey will be helpful when you want, but they leave you alone. We enjoyed great conversation for over two hours, listening to piped in jazz, lazing in the dark shadows of the wood paneled room, basking in soft and hazy light.\n\nWhat is not so great: \nThey only have barstools to sit on. If you're young and spry and fit to a stool easily and have no back complaints and are not a larger sized person, you're fine. But I have shorter legs and a more ample body, and today I can still feel the ache of sitting on a backless stool with no place for my feet but the rungs beneath me (barrel tables = cool. no place to dangle feet = not so cool)\nThere were some folks who looked like they brought in food. I have read a review saying they offer food. That may be on weekends or special nights. To my knowledge, there was no food, which is really only an issue if you're drinking and need something to sop it up a bit.\nFinally, there were no servers on the weeknight. This was really NOT a problem. But you need to know.\n\nOne related issue is parking. The lot behind the bar is usable but cost $4 and may cost more or less on given nights. There is parallel parking on the street but of course, this means you may have to hunt, and you need change.\n\nWhile I'm still looking for a loungey, girls-night-out friendly, chat and have cocktails with fruit in them kind of place for a midweek meet up with my girlfriends, I absolutely will return to the bar with my man or another couple or visitors for the expert drinks and interesting Last Century feel.\n", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-06-17T14:26:27-0400", "location_id": "4661359", "id": "280991288", "user": {"username": "Christine D", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": "2014-08", "title": "Bourbon Drinkers Paradise", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60785-d4661359-r279249789-m11068-Century_Bar-Dayton_Ohio.html#review279249789", "text": "While I am not much of a Bourbon drinker, this is the place to go if you are.
