This is the place you never want to leave. Gail, the owner, has cookies and coffee, her puppy, and the coziest store I have ever been in. They often have knitting and weaving clubs or classes. The yarns are stunning. Most definitely a great stop if you are in town.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Solo travel", "published_date": "2016-10-12T10:22:23-0400", "location_id": "11677645", "id": "427317964", "user": {"username": "Joan R", "user_location": {"name": "Longmont, Colorado", "id": "33527"}}}]}
