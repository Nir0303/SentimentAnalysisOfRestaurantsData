Delicious food that is packed... In other words, if you are counting calories, this place is not for you because their sandwiches are enormous.\n\nIt's an interesting location because there is an airplane that is used as a restaurant.\n\nGranted, the place does get pack and if you are there for lunch, just know it takes a while for them to barbecue and prepare the meal.  \n\nThe only thing is it does get hot during the summer inside the plane and even with powerful fans, there are a lot of flies which I didn't like.\n\nBut overall, it's one of the best sandwich shops out there.  \n\nI heard there is new ownership now for the location taking over the restaurant, so I hope they maintain the quality of the food.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-02-27T19:03:48-0500", "location_id": "4948726", "id": "351451260", "user": {"username": "kndy2099", "user_location": {"name": "California", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 3, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Well, we went there once...", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g33193-d4948726-r297243315-m11068-Richard_s_Lunchbox-Tulare_California.html#review297243315", "text": "We have heard and read mixed reviews and thought, since they were mixed we would judge for ourselves.  I can see why the reviews were mixed.  We arrived about 6:45 on a Saturday night (they close at 8).  We ordered a \"Randy burger\" and a pulled pork sandwich.  They were out of the hot-link, which go on the Randy burger, but had linguisa instead.  We ordered the burger dry, no sauce at all, and no pickles.  The wait for this burger is 20 minutes and we were prepared to wait.    The entrees were brought to our picnic table.  They looked great and we were about to dive in, but first wanted to make sure the burger was dry.  It was not!  It even had the pickles.  We returned the burger and they prepared a new bun.  By this time, the meat was cold and they  still didn't serve it dry.  This time they put mustard bbq sauce on the burger.  We gave up and decided to keep it.  The burger was good, but the bread didn't hold up for even half of the burger.  The pulled pork was good and spicy, but again the bun didn't hold up and was soggy.  The bean side was good and the people were friendly.  But, sadly this isn't a place we will return.  But hey, check it out, maybe you will have better luck than us.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Couples", "published_date": "2015-08-09T10:11:22-0400", "location_id": "4948726", "id": "297243315", "user": {"username": "ShreRnae", "user_location": {"name": "Exeter, CA", "id": null}}}]}
