There was not one clean table that was unoccupied in the whole restaurant.  I'd like to say I'm exaggerating, but sadly, I'm not.  Every empty table was covered in dirty dishes that had clearly been there for awhile.  In fact, we had to ask one of the employees to clear a table for us so we could sit.  He seemed annoyed, but did it.  The floors were just as disgusting as the tables covered with napkins, food, and other debris.  Where was the manager? How could anyone allow a restaurant to get to this condition?  Also there were no napkins or clean silverware; we had to use the takeout, plastic silverware packets which was fine with me as I trusted that more than anything they may (or may not) have cleaned.\n\nThe only reason this review is a 3 star rather than a 2 star is because the food was good, but eating in that mess caused me to lose my appetite and question the cleanliness of the kitchen.

The soup was tasteless and salty with small manufactured wontons in abundance.  Its probably not fair to judge a restaurant on the basis of one item but this restaurant is part of a large successful chain and they should be ashamed to present this item as part of their menu.
