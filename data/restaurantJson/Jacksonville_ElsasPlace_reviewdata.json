Everything I've had is REALLY good. They have great Caribbean food like Jerk Chicken, Curry Chicken, and its mixed with some southern favorites like Fried Pork Chops, Smothered Chicken, oxtails, Fish, all kinds of great fresh veggies Collards, cabbage, Mac and Cheese, just to name a few. They have plenty of other meats too, and they'll fix it any way you want it. For instance some of my favorites is Jerk Shrimp, Smothered Jerk Chicken, Stewed Chicken and veggies and the list goes on. They literally cook your food to order the way you want it.  That being said, it does take them a while to make it, so if you're short on time you NEED to call ahead 30 mins. And there's a chance you may still have to wait depending on how many people have ordered before you. This is not a 5 star restaurant, its a hole in the wall home town dive, the floors are a little sticky, the tables are a little wobbly, but that adds to the charm. But if you look past that they are great people, nice and they really work hard serving great, fresh food, and the portions are enormous, 2 people could share easily. Also they're jerk is pretty spicy, so keep that in mind, if your not a spicy fan go with smothered chicken or pork chips, stewed chicken or fish, there's plenty of options for anyone.   So if you have some time give them a try.

The staff here are very friendly and have a great sense of humor.  You do have to have patience if you order onsite.  It might take a little bit for the food to be cooked, but it is well worth it.  I highly recommend calling your order in advance so that you can arrive onsite and dine in/ or take out.  They have many items to choose from on their menu, and a lot of sides to go with their meals.  The jerk chicken does have a little bit of a kick to it, but highly recommended.  I've had their chicken curry in the past, which was also very delicious, but I'm not used to picking out the bones compared to indian/ japanese curries.  The atmosphere is a little dark, but again the food is worth it.  There have been many times where I've been lured in by the smell of the food, standing several blocks away.

I was looking for Jamaican food and heard there was a restaurant in Jacksonville, NC.  At the time, I was visiting family in New Bern.  I left out with a friend headed for a nice day in the sun.  When we arrived, they had not yet opened.  It was around 11:30 am and they opened at 12:00 pm.  This was stated on the web, but we left early to make sure we could find it.  It is tucked away in a small space downtown.  You can enter from the front or the back and there was plenty of parking behind.  As we sat there waiting, the crowd started to form.  We were encouraged trying it for the first time to see so many people waiting to go in.\n\nWhen we went in, it is quaint.  Caribbean colors and flags are on the walls.  It is not new, but the counter and table were clean.  We were given a menu and took a seat.  The gentleman that waited on us was very friendly.  Seeing it was our first time, he sat at the table and walked us through the process.  It smelled great!  They have oxtail and goat on Saturdays only.  I had not had either so he gave us a sample to try.  The menu was full of options and plenty of sides.\n\nWe ordered the jerk chicken, oxtails/goat, the plates came with rice and peas and 2 sides.  We tried the fried squash, fried okra, mac and cheese and jamaican stir fry vegetables.  We were informed everything was cooked fresh so it would be a wait. That was no issue for us.  We took the number so we could call ahead the next time. And there will be many more times.  The jerk chicken was a flattened, nice sized chicken breast with jerk seasoning spicy enough to make you sniffle a bit.  The fried veggies were crunchy with a light batter and seasoning.  It was hard to tell if that was a little spicy seasoning on them because my mouth was plesantly on fire.  The stir fry veggies had a combination of cabbage, carrots, and onions, at least with a little brown sauce.  Not sure if that was soy sauce or not.  \n\nThe tea was sweet and so was the lemonade...with free refills.\n\nThere were about 12 tables and it was busy from the time we arrived until we left.  The flavors tasted authentic.  The spice was nice and hot, flavorful but not too much.  The oxtail and goat was stewed to perfection, falling off the bone (or tail).  We also ordered a beef patty to try.  It was light and crispy. The filling was tasty.\n\nThe portions were generous.  I enjoyed the ambiance and the occassional shout to the cook in a beautiful accent.  \n\nIf you don't order ahead, don't be in a rush. It will be fresh.  If you do order ahead, it will be fresh.  Either way, I don't think you will be disappointed.\n\nA great find tucked away with flavor and no frills, just good food.  When I am in the area again, I will be there.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-03-09T10:42:26-0400", "location_id": "2650347", "id": "258613474", "user": {"username": "PurpleTrippin", "user_location": {"name": "Durham, North Carolina", "id": "49092"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2014-10", "title": "Great Carribean Food, Place needs Cleaned Up Though", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49242-d2650347-r236025706-m11068-Elsa_s_Place-Jacksonville_North_Carolina.html#review236025706", "text": "First, I am giving it four stars based on the food alone.
