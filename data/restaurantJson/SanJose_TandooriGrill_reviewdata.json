Restaurants have sprung up in Milpitas, Sunnyvale and Mountain View but good ones are still sparse in San Jose.\n\nThis was by far and away the best Northern Indian food I've had in San Jose - even better than the more expensive but better situated place with the stellar reputation.\n\nWe went for the lunch buffet and everything was good. The butter chicken was actually spicy - which might NOT be to everyone's taste but suited us.\n\nThe decor is down market  and it's definitely more of a cafe than a restaurant but is very well worth visiting for a casual lunch.\n\nI'll be back to report on the a la carte items.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2016-10-15T18:41:50-0400", "location_id": "11621002", "id": "428285427", "user": {"username": "Margaret S", "user_location": {"name": "San Jose, California", "id": "33020"}}}]}
