Thus it has many business people amongst its devotees. Being close to City Hall and the County Courthouse, it also serves many government people. It's a testament to the quality of this unpretentious establishment that many residents of the Scranton area go out of their way to dine at Abe's. The proprietor is a warm outgoing fellow who is most welcoming. The restaurant has an ample seating area and is very clean and bright, But it also caters to a take-out clientele.  \nUnusual for kosher restaurants, Abe's serves both meat and dairy dishes. They prepare these two cuisines separately. The menu lists dishes as diverse as mozzarella and tomato in toasted pita to substantial sandwiches of pastrami, corned beef, turkey, salami, etc. Abe's serves a breakfast special that is a real bargain-2 eggs served any style, home fried potatoes, and toast for a very low price of $2,50. On one visit the foursome in our party had a variety of dairy specials that included blintzes, a lox omelet, tossed salad with baked salmon, and falafel in a wrap with quinoa tabouli. Everyone spoke highly of the quality and tastiness of the fare. Service is superb. On another day we savored the meat menu-a platter of knockwurst with baked beans and a side of cole slaw, a huge pastrami sandwich with a side of potato salad, chicken soup with matzo balls, and brisket of beef. Again, all dishes were superb. The staff exudes the same warmth as the owner, They are always there with an extra napkin, filling coffee mugs, and answering any questions that arise. That warmth is captivating and it is not unusual for strangers at nearby tables to strike up a conversation. Summing up Abe's Deli serves a wide variety of well prepared tasty food at very reasonable prices. That along with the bright cleanliness, excellent service and warm atmosphere make this a delightful place to dine. Abe's is a real find.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-10-30T07:31:59-0400", "location_id": "836665", "id": "432928923", "user": {"username": "Arthur M", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-10", "title": "Good food reasonably priced", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60969-d836665-r427881954-m11068-Abe_s_Kosher_Delicatessen-Scranton_Pennsylvania.html#review427881954", "text": "Enjoyed it so much we went twice in our 3 day stay.
