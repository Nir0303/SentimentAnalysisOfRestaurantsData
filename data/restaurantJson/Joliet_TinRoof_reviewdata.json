It was not crowded, but the singer and his guitar were so loud that we couldn't talk the whole dinner. I ordered the burger, which was just a very average, non juicy burger. the homemade fries were pretty good. My mom ordered the salmon, and said that it was ok. She gave it a 5 out 10. Her biggest complaint is that she told the waiter that she can't have anything spicy, and the rice that came with it was spicy, so she couldn't eat it. It was expensive for a piece of salmon with no sides to eat(oddly her dinner came with no optional sides, but my hubby's dinner came with a choice or a side and a soup, and they were under the same list of dinners on the menu. Not sure how they decide who gets a side and soup, and who doesn't?). The kicker was my hubby's steak. He ordered the ribeye steak medium rare. It came out and he cut into it and it is well done. It is a thin steak, so understandably this can happen. He showed the waiter, and the waiter looked at it and totally agreed that it was well done. He took his plate back to the kitchen and came back less that a minute later. The cook told him to cut in to the other side of the steak, since it is slightly thicker. Seriously??? We are talking about an 1/8th of an inch thicker, and it was just as well done.  I've never in all my life heard of a cook sending the same steak back and suggesting that the customer try cutting in to the other side and try to find some medium rare area. The waiter took the plate back, and they did replace the steak. Hubby said it was pretty good, but really not worth the hassle he felt that he shouldn't have gotten.\nA couple good notes, the drinks were tasty, although expensive, hubby loved his chili, and his potatoes were really tasty.

When we arrived I was almost taken aback by the band (Saturday night). I thought they were too loud. But little did I know, we ended up having a great time. Unique food and drinks, great bartenders, esp. Danny - the GM.  He made us feel welcome, offered us a taste of drinks and mixtures we've never seen or tried before and kept us company when he wasn't busy with other customers. The band was very entertaining as well. We will definitely be back soon. We can't wait to bring the guys a taste of Czech Beherovka and Eastern European aged brandy.
