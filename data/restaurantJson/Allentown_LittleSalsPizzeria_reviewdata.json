We all  had their angel-hair pasta with Sal's extraordinary meat sauce and found it to be not only a more than ample but an above average tasty dish of pasta. Add the complimentary glass of red or white wine or a cold bottle of beer if you chose, their endless basket of garlic sticks and you end up having one heck of a satisfying lunch or dinner. Left with my friends and vowed that we'd all be back for another get together at Little Sal's on Roth Avenue. An incredibly friendly and attentive staff helps that from the time you walk in until you leave, just makes you want to return to this little best kept secret of the Lehigh Valley. You won't be rushed through the time you spend here which at times has been a problem at some of the dining spots we've been to in the past. It's a must to put Little Sal's on your list and you won't ever regret stopping for one fine plate of pasta.
