Well, there were several tables unoccupied, but we still had to wait way past our reservation time. Then upon seating until the time our food was brought to our table was an hour and a half!!!!  We were full of water and iced tea before food was insight!  We contemplated many times just getting up and leaving. We noticed all the tables around us were  waiting long times for their food also. Many unhappy diners at this restaurant.  The servers are all over the place, forgetting to bring starters.  Don't try and order a  cocktail refill, it will take even longer to get it.  There is such a breakdown in the front of the house communication with the kitchen.  Do you blame the server or blame the kitchen?? Our decision is to forego this place in the future.  There are many other great places in town to eat, this place is not a place we will go to again.  We did give it a shot and both times a huge let down.  Don't waste your time at this place.
