Now we have it in our own backyard and we couldn't be happier!  My daughter and I discovered it on a cruise down Pollasky Avenue in Old Town Clovis and stopped in right away.  They have only been open six months but already there are three distinct seatings areas - cafe tables in front along the sidewalk, patio in the back, and then the  main room.\n\nWe were greeted by the owner's daughter and the barista and treated in such a friendly manner that we felt we knew them immediately.  When we inquired they told us about plans to expand the menu and bring live music to the large patio area and then we were given a personal tour of the place.  I went back the next week with two friends and we sat out front and watched people and cars meander slowly by.  Felt like the best part of Mayberry! (Or Cayucos, or Morro Bay.)\n\nWe just love it here and can't wait to go again and bring the vacation feel and friendliness to our lives on a regular basis.  No Starbucks or coffee house in Clovis can top this.  They did it right with attention to detail, color, atmosphere, and most important - treating their customers like friends.
