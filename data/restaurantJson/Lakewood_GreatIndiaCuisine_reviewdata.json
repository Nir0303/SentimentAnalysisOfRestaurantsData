When I learned their version was thighs and drumsticks I passed.  I ordered the chicken Tikka also from the Tandoor menu and expected moist pieces of chicken.  I got a sizzling platter with raw onions and peppers. I was told that was the way it was served in India.  Not like any sizzling platter version I had ever had before.  I asked that they be cooked more.  Instead of nicely caramelized onions that I have had with other sizzling platters, I got greasy onions and peppers that had fairly heavy spice levels but still were not cooked. Their green chutney was fine.\n\nHowever, the chicken tikka pieces were so dry that I had to order some raita to moisturize the chicken.  Their version is that the chicken tikka is breast meat, so of course it is going to be dry.    Given the short time it took for my entree to come out, there is no way that it was cooked to order. It was dry because it had been reheated.\n\nMy husband's chicken jalharzi (incorrect spelling) had ok chicken thigh meat, but it was a very small dish with very few vegetables.  He ordered it for the vegetables.\n\nWhite basmati rice was totally unacceptional.  No saffron seasoning, and just a few black carraway seeds.\n\nOur server was friendly and accommodating, and water was refilled, but none of that could make up for the poor food that cost $35 including a 15% tip.\n\nFoot-long sandwiches at Subway would have been a better value and experience.

It was pretty good but I would order off of the menu next time and skip the lunch buffet. They had some great naan and paneer and other dishes. The mango lemonade was pretty good too. I think the menu items are probably tastier since they are fresher than the buffet. But the buffet was good and hot :)", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s4.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2011-08-29T14:04:24-0400", "location_id": "915769", "id": "117422967", "user": {"username": "Jenwee", "user_location": {"name": "San Antonio, Texas", "id": "60956"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 5, "travel_date": null, "title": "Phenominal lunch buffet!!", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g58555-d915769-r70964805-m11068-Great_India_Cuisine-Lakewood_Washington.html#review70964805", "text": "This is best kept secret in Lakewood!! It's not a big place ( about 15 tables) and I haven't had the chance to go for their great dinner menu, but every chance I get, I go for  the lunch buffet. They make great butter chicken, and saag paneer, and tandoori chicken is always a staple on the lunch buffet. The meat dishes change each day, but I have yet to be disappointed. Most dishes aren't too spicy----they clearly label the spicy ones; and it goes great with their mango lemonade.  :)   I live in Lakewood, i've been going here for about 5 years, and have never been disappointed.", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": null, "published_date": "2010-07-14T21:27:03-0400", "location_id": "915769", "id": "70964805", "user": {"username": "scrappinbug", "user_location": {"name": "Lakewood, WA", "id": null}}}]}
