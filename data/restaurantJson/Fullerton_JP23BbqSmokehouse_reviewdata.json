One of the worst dining experiences of my life.  We came here because another site recommended it highly.  The dining area was only about 15% occupied at 5:30 on a Saturday night.  WE figured we were ahead of the evening rush.  The hostess did her job by sitting us.  Then after a few minutes someone came by to ask if we had been taken care of?  Since we had no menus, water or dirks I didn't think I had to answer the question.  I held back on my sarcasm.  Someone else arrived and introduced herself as the manager and immediately complained that a worker hadn't shown up for work.  Not our problem!  She took our order for drinks.  Then some guy shows up with our two Arnold Palmers and a glass of wine for my gal.  OMG, when he set the wine on the table we all noticed that he had his entire palm resting on the rim of the glass.  He realized his mistake and took the glass back.  Our Tea drinks were not Arnold Palmers!  When the manager returned I informed her that they forgot to add the lemonade to the drinks.  I asked her who made the APs and she said she did.  I asked her what makes an AP  She said she knew the ingredients.  I told her that she did not..  It seemed the she wanted to make a point that the customer is not always right.    She took the drinks away and returned with just about the same tea colored drinks!  Forget it.  By then we had ordered our food.  I'd say that it took about 25 minutes to deliver our food.  Way to long for BBQ and a nearly empty restaurant.  The food was nothing to write home about.

Upon our arrival, we walked in and found the atmosphere to be clean and inviting with approx. 25+ televisions with sports on the tube (nice).  As we looked around for a hostess or waitress for seating directions (since there's a hostess podium near the front door) for the next few minutes we were greeted by stares from who we originally thought were other customers enjoying the game.  We eventually located a waiter who directed us to a table.\n\nThe waiter recommended their two top specialties (ribs and brisket) at which time we took his recommendation and ordered one of each.  \n\nAs we waited for our food and enjoyed watching the baseball game we noticed that those \"customers\" who stared at us when we first walked in eventually left their table and began working in the restaurant.  These customers were actually employees!  \n\nOur main course arrived in about 15 minutes.  The ribs were smoked to perfection and the brisket was dry.  They have 4 different types of BBQ sauce to try but we settled on the original recipe (which wasn't so tasty).  We personally like the old store bought bbq sauce so maybe that's what were accustomed to.  If you enjoy ribs without any sauce then these ribs are for you.  Overall the rest of the meal was on the bland side and just okay.  \n\nIf you're looking for a place to watch a sports game and drink a beer then this is the right place.\n\nThe location is at the corner of a busy intersection and in a premium spot but so far every business that has opened there has only lasted 12-18 months and unfortunately, I see the same for this place.  We had some high hopes but at the end of the day.......there'll be no cheers here.", "helpful_votes": "1", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-10-04T21:30:55-0400", "location_id": "4440404", "id": "179772664", "user": {"username": "FRANK M", "user_location": {"name": "FULLERTON", "id": null}}}]}
