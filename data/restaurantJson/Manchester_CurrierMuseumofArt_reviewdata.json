The first few times I went to this museum, I was with my daughters. Each time, we were stalked by the docents, making it difficult to enjoy the art. This last time, I went with a friend (adult). Friendly front desk staff greeted us and so I thought, \"this time will be different!\" Sadly, no, it was not. We were still followed around and in one of the galleries, the docent there literally paced at a fast clip across the room, over and over. At times, he even brushed past me and my friend. I don't understand why the Currier has such overzealous/aggressive docents - I have never felt as uncomfortable in a museum as I have each time I visited the Currier. I like that we have good quality art to appreciate, but please, Currier powers that be, please be kinder and less aggressive so your patrons can enjoy their experience there.\n\nThat said, the cafe is nice and I had the best sandwich there - it was an Asian-inspired sandwich with pork belly - it was surprisingly delicious and I would go there just for that if I knew for sure it was still on the menu, but I hesitate to return because of all of the uncomfortable experiences that have left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't see similar complaints in other reviews - am I the only one noticing this and it's not as bad as I think it is? Or, are people just not aware of what is going on around them? No idea.

We appreciate candid, helpful reviews, and yours, while not giving us high marks, will prove helpful. \n\nI think you are probably referring to our Security team, rather than the docents. The docents are volunteers who provide tours of the Museum and Zimmerman House. I will pass this information on to our head of Security and see what adjustments they can make in this regard. Do know that sometimes, when the Museum isn't filled with visitors, it can seem like you're being \"trailed\" by Security, but they are simply being moved from room to room to provide a safe experience for you (and the art, of course).
