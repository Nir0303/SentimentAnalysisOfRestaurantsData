Brussel Sprouts are composed of almonds, and cheese. The flavors combine were immaculate. The flavors just become alive. For main course I suggest Grilled Swordfish, served with eggplant pur\u00e9e and sided with arugula which was reasonably priced at $24.00. To top it off your dinner with a local desert is a must.

Complimented well by perfectly crisped and piping hot sweet potatoes! The sauce for the fish comes separate so you can adjust if you don't want it smothered and actually want to enjoy the fish's flavor.

However, I had to write a second review, because it is so important to acknowledge consistent excellence! During our visit in May, we enjoyed crawfish bisque, the crawfish omelet,  matzo ball soup, and salad luke. The food was Fantastic!! The server was a little off, but he made up for this with two complimentary \"to go\"cups of champagne. That small gesture went a long way! I would highly recommend this restaurant, again.
