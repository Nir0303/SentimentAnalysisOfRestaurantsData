I ordered a Coke and my wife ordered iced tea: both came to our table in cans!  I asked for a glass or a cup and they said they were out of glasses and cups!!!  My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which was cooked until the chicken was hard.  I ordered a Coney dog and a Chicago dog.  The Chicago was OK, but the hot dog was shriveled, like it had been in the cooker for days.  The Coney had some sort of a chili on it that was ground so fine that it was like a syrup instead of chili.  Our onion rings were fine, but the portion was very small (6 small rings).  There are no tables - just hi-rise bar stools and and hi-rise bar tables: very uncomfortable.  This place was awful.

We went on a Saturday afternoon and ordered two burgers with fries.   The burgers were cooked to our request.  The fries were hot and firm.  The service was prompt and friendly.  Best of all, we had a coupon from the local Deerfield Beach Observer that was a bogo for the burger. Although the location is off of the main traffic routes (it is north of Hillsboro Blvd. and across from City Hall) it is worth the effort to get a burger that is better than what the franchise chains offer.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s5.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Food", "name": "rate_food", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Atmosphere", "name": "rate_atmosphere", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2013-05-21T09:30:58-0400", "location_id": "4137523", "id": "161412556", "user": {"username": "Esti93", "user_location": {"name": "Florida", "id": null}}}]}
