Being paranoid from the night before when my waitress forgot my salad; I asked her if it was coming.  She replied since it is home made, it will take a while.  Soon there after the soup came.  It looked like egg drop soup with vegetables.  It was tasty and very fresh.  I liked it, but didn't think it was hot and sour soup, till the waitress told me it was.  Must be the Canton Minnesota version.  Then I waited a little long, and was informed they cannot make a pint of house fried rice, only a quart.  I change to the veggie rice.  It call came shortly after that.\nThe chicken was cooked perfectly and tasty.  Not over powering with orange taste, but ok.  The rice was good.  I had asked for hot mustard with the meal.  I received a small cup of it.  When I asked for more, she told me the cook had to make more for me.  She then got me a few more cups.  There was plenty to eat and average for taste.
