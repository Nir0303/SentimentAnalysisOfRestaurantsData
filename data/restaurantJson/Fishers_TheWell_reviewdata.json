Looked industrial but toned down by barn wood accented throughout. \nThe decor on the inside is very modern an inviting with a couple of semi-private rooms for meetings, etc. Service was good and they just happened to be featuring a very good Ethiopian pour over that was fantastic. A bit pricey, but very good. My wife had the Earl Grey Lavender Tea that smelled great and she enjoyed very much. I looked around and saw a couple of breakfast plates like scrambled eggs, muffins, etc. which looked pretty tasty but we had just eaten and only wanted the pick me up. \nWe didn't stay long due to a scheduled meeting but we'll be back on our next visit to Fishers. There were some other choices that looked very good as well. Cold drip, latte, chai, and more. Check it out, good stuff!!
