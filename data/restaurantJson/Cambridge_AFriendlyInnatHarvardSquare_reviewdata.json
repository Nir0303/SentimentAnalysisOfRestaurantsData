I was at Harvard for a conference. The stay was booked and paid directly by the university (about $250). \n\nThe Inn is a lousy and depression place. Despite its prime location, some of minimal functions as an acceptable lodging are lacking. There does not seem to have an individual heating unit in the room. Even in May, the New England weather is so unpredictable. I woke up with freezing temperature at 4am. No mention how low quality of the bed, blanket, etc - far below Motel 6 standard.\n\nThe breakfast was a joke. There were plenty of pastries (like those cheapest ones one can get at Stop and Shop) which were not attractive to me at all. There were also some fruits and hard boiled eggs (cold served). The problem is that the food doesn't look fresh and seems to be there for many days already. \n\nParking: this is the main complaint that I am writing the review. It may be very biased because of my personal poor experience. I checked out the hotel at 8am and went straight to the conference, while leaving my car at the Inn. I did ask if I can pick up the car later at 6pm after the conference. The person at the front desk was not sure about it, but didn't give me affirmative NO neither. When I picked up the car, I was charged $100 for parking, with the rate $30/hour. It is an outrageous rate.\n\nJust for one night stay, my impression is that this Inn is not running a good business. Even during the busiest days around  the commencement, this Inn is still quite vacant (most of the people stayed there for the same conference). My feeling is that they are trying to make profit from any \"incidental\" charges. \n\nCompare A Friendly Inn with other lodging nearby. The Irvine house which is just next door, on the other hand, was very lively. My husband stayed there a few times, and was okay with it. We also stayed at The Charles Hotel a couple of times and loved it, but it is a more luxurious hotel (on the other hand, their valet parking is \"only\" $40/night).", "helpful_votes": "3", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s1.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Value", "name": "rate_value", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "1", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss1.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-05-25T05:58:56-0400", "location_id": "123187", "id": "376399428", "user": {"username": "Lan-Hsuan H", "user_location": {"name": "Hartford, Connecticut", "id": "33804"}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2016-05", "title": "Reasonably priced for it's location", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d123187-r374533363-m11068-A_Friendly_Inn_at_Harvard_Square-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review374533363", "text": "This quaint B&B is within walking distance to Harvard campus and the T.

The rooms are heated by massive old radiators that raise the temperature to 80F in the room so we found it impossible to sleep\n2) Opening the windows to reduce heat let in loud street noise. (Bring earplugs.) \n2) Wifi was very unreliable.  We lost it for 2 hours on 2 different nights, and when it was running it frequently dropped the connection. This made Skype and FaceTime impossible to use.\n3) First room we had was very small (size of our spare bedroom at home) with OK storage and nice bathroom. Second room was larger with large bath but no dresser. \n4) Because there isn't enough parking for all the rooms (7 or 8 spots for 17 rooms) if you use your car you may not get a spot when you come back.  If you don't mind just parking it, it's OK. If you were planning on driving to suburbs like me, it's a problem.\n5) Breakfast pastries were so stale we couldn't eat them.  Every morning we went to Darwin's or the convenience store to get food that was fresh. (The Inn could do this!)\n\nGetting to our room involved two tall flights of narrow stairs.  Nice to have exercise but were glad we didn't have large cases. TV's were size of our laptop screens but we didn't need them because we brought out laptops :-)\n\nSummary: The awesome location and \"low\" price ($200 once you add taxes) are enough to make this place a 3* even though we couldn't sleep. If they would fix the temperature so you could sleep and wifi so you could FaceTime/Skype it would be a 4* for people who want a clean, well-located room with private bath at a good price.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Location", "name": "rate_location", "value": "5", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss5.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Business", "published_date": "2016-04-14T16:08:04-0400", "location_id": "123187", "id": "364251770", "user": {"username": "Havanistim", "user_location": {"name": "Montreal", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 4, "travel_date": "2015-11", "title": "Convenient", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d123187-r329080576-m11068-A_Friendly_Inn_at_Harvard_Square-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review329080576", "text": "Enjoyed our stay.

It was in a quiet corner but I could hear all the noises in the aisle and stairs.\nNot a place I would come for a longer stay.", "helpful_votes": "0", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s3.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Friends getaway", "published_date": "2015-09-30T07:34:40-0400", "location_id": "123187", "id": "315078383", "user": {"username": "Ale N", "user_location": {"name": null, "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Pay for location?", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d123187-r297371909-m11068-A_Friendly_Inn_at_Harvard_Square-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review297371909", "text": "The accommodations here can best be described as \u201cEuropean\u201d.  It is located two blocks from the north-east corner of Harvard Yard.\n\nMy wife and I stayed in Room 104 for six consecutive nights in early August.  Our room-rate was $187, but with the 14.5% tax rate added in, the total bill for six nights was $1284.  Our room with a queen bed measured 15 ft x 15 ft.  It had an adjoining private bathroom that measured a tiny 4 ft x 6 ft.  The bathroom contained a toilet, a tiny sink with a basin measuring 8 in x 12 in, and a stand-up shower with a triangular floor in which the long sides were 3 ft x 3 ft.  The furnishings were old-ish and a bit worn but were clean and fully functional.  The dresser drawers had an odd musty smell but looked clean.  Decorations were sparse; there\u2019s none of the Victorian bric-a-brac that one can often find in more traditional bed-and breakfasts.\n\nThe free breakfast each morning was strictly continental, served in a common room in the basement.  It consisted of cereals, fresh fruit (bananas, apples and mandarin oranges), hard-boiled eggs and store-bought pastries.  Some of the pastries were above average; certainly better than the type found in a Hampton Inn.  Coffee, tea, milk and orange juice were provided.  The tea was bitter, but the orange juice was excellent.  It had the taste of not-from-concentrate from a carton.  Breakfast is served until 10:30 am.\n\nThere are six parking spaces provided in the paved back-yard of the inn, on a first-come, first-served basis for the 17 rooms that might be booked.  We were lucky enough to be able to park our car for five of our six nights.  On one night when the lot was full, we parked in a public garage a good half-mile away on the opposite side of Harvard Square at a cost of $28 for the night.  If you plan to just stay in the Cambridge/Boston area, you won\u2019t need a car.\n\nUnlike some of the tripadvisor reviews, we did not notice any noise from adjacent rooms and generally had a very quiet stay.  We ran our window AC unit at night on an automatic thermostat.  However on our first night, we were awakened at 1:30 am by a loud thump-thump-thump of water drops falling onto our outside AC unit from the AC of the room above us.  This continued all night and we got little sleep.  The next evening we taped a bit of cloth onto the top of our AC outside our window and had no further problems.\n\nOur room and bathroom were kept very clean by the maids.  However on our first night in the room, upon pulling back the covers of the bed at 11 pm, we noticed a long black hair on the bottom sheet.  After fully pulling all the covers off, we found a total of nine hairs, both long and short, all over the bottom sheet.  The sheets otherwise looked very clean and the bed was tightly made.  I went to the front office to complain but it was closed due to the late hour.  But then after calling 0 on the nearby phone, a clerk immediately answered and came to the office within just a half-minute, and immediately gave me a fresh set of sheets to put on the bed.  Our room was otherwise well-kept during our stay and our one experience might have been anomalous to the standards of this establishment.\n\nIn summary, A Friendly Inn is nothing fancy but provides basic reasonable accommodations very close to Harvard.  I just can\u2019t believe that they can get away with charging so much for such basic and small accommodations.  I suppose the price is for the location.  The competing inn next door has tripadvisor reviews that are equally disappointing and charge a higher price.  Hotel prices in the area are mind-boggling.  I think if I were to return, I might have to stay here again, but before I do, I would certainly spend more time checking out the offerings on airbnb.", "helpful_votes": "2", "rating_image_url": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/img/cdsi/img2/ratings/traveler/s2.0-11068-5.png", "subratings": [{"localized_name": "Rooms", "name": "rate_room", "value": "2", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss2.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Cleanliness", "name": "rate_cleanliness", "value": "3", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss3.0.gif"}, {"localized_name": "Service", "name": "rate_service", "value": "4", "rating_image_url": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/ratings/traveler/ss4.0.gif"}], "owner_response": null, "trip_type": "Family", "published_date": "2015-08-09T18:46:22-0400", "location_id": "123187", "id": "297371909", "user": {"username": "gtcochran", "user_location": {"name": "Louisiana", "id": null}}}, {"lang": "en", "rating": 2, "travel_date": "2015-08", "title": "Disappointed Big Time", "url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60890-d123187-r297243414-m11068-A_Friendly_Inn_at_Harvard_Square-Cambridge_Massachusetts.html#review297243414", "text": "Stayed here a couple of years ago and parking was no problem.

Our room this visit was TINY- small as in European small - like no real space for normal suitcases.  The stairs are really steep and narrow, which makes schlepping suitcases a true challenge.  Breakfast was okay - served in a dungeon like room in the basement, with regular choices like cereals, pastries, toast (but no butter), coffee, etc. Hosts are pleasant and the location can't be beat - 15 minute walk to Harvard Square and the Red Line!!
