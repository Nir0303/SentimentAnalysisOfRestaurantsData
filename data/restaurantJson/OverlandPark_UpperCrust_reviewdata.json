Stumbled across Upper Crust after strolling through the Farmer's Market. Saw a dozen or more happy people sitting outside and in with pie in their hands, in their mouths, and on their faces. I immediately wanted some of that joy, so I went inside. So. Many. Pies. So many choices, Omg what to do! I bought a peanut butter cookie, a slice of Bumble Berry pie, and what's pie without coffee... (It was good coffee, by the way). Dang! Out of bumble berry. I dared to be adventurous and try gooseberry for the first time ever. It was tart (no pun intended), which was a perfect counter-balance to the sweet crust. Normally I don't eat pie crust because I've never found one that was good enough to eat by itself (like my Grammy used to make). Crusts are usually either too dense, too chewy, or woefully bland. But the pie crust at Upper Crust rocks! It was amazing. It was almost like a pastry by itself: flaky, but doesn't fly everywhere when you bite into it; light but substantive, mildly sweet and flavorful. Very nice place to stop for pie and coffee after a hard day of shopping.
