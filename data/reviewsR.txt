Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.~negative
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.~negative
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.~negative
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.~negative
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.~negative
Avoid this place!~negative
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.~positive
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.~positive
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.~positive
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.~positive
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.~positive
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.~negative
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.~negative
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.~negative
Food was okay, nothing great.~negative
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.~negative
I/we will never go back to this place again.~negative
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!~positive
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!~positive
You can't go wrong here.~positive
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.~positive
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.~positive
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.~positive
Can't wait wait for my next visit.~positive
I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.'~negative
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back.~negative
The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.~negative
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.~positive
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).~positive
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.~negative
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.~negative

We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.~negative
What's the difference between the two?~negative
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!~positive
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!~positive
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!~positive
we love th pink pony.~positive
THe perfect spot.~positive
Food-awesome.~positive
Service- friendly and attentive.~positive
Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.~positive
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.~positive
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.~negative
(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..)~negative
the food is decent.~negative
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.~negative
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.~negative
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.~negative
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience.~negative
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.~negative
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.~positive
I had a great experience.~positive
Food is great.~positive
Service is top notch.~positive
I have been going back again and again.~positive
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.~positive
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.~positive
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.~positive
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.~positive
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.~positive
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.~negative
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.~negative
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.~positive
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.~positive
The food was well prepared and the service impecable.~positive
I'm going back.~positive
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.~negative
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.~positive
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.~negative
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).~positive
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!~positive
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.~negative
It is terrific, as is the value.~positive
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.~positive
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.~positive
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.~negative
Go hungry and enjoy.~positive
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.~positive

I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.~positive

The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.~negative
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.~negative
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.~negative
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.~positive
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.~negative
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.~positive
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.~positive
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.~positive
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.~positive
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.~positive
The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.~positive

I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.~negative
IT WAS HORRIBLE.~negative
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!~negative
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.~negative
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.~negative
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.~negative
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.~negative
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.~positive

A big disappointment, all around.~negative
I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.~positive
The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.~positive
The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.~positive
Worth the trip from Manhattan.~positive
Was there Friday night.~negative
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.~positive
And I've been to many NYC delis.~negative
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.~positive
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.~negative
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.~positive
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.~positive
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.~positive
This place is worth an one-hour drive.~positive
I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.~positive
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.~positive
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.~positive
Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter.~negative
Decent wine at reasonable prices.~negative
Decent wine at reasonable prices.~positive
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.~positive
Our teenage kids love it, too.~positive
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.~positive
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.~positive
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.~positive
You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.~negative
I'm partial to the Gnocchi.~positive
This place is incredibly tiny.~negative
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.~negative
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.~negative
The food was bland oily.~negative
I just don't understand all the hype...~negative
We went to Ino for Valentines.~negative
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.~positive
We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.~positive
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.~positive
When we sat, we got great and fast service.~positive
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.~positive
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.~positive
This is a fun restaurant to go to.~positive
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.~positive
But the pizza is way to expensive.~negative
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.~negative
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.~negative
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.~negative
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.~negative
I don't think I would go again.~negative
This place is great.~positive
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.~positive
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal!~positive
Service was prompt, friendly and great.~positive
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!~negative

There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.~positive
Located at the end of a magnificent block.~positive
Very cozy and warm inside.....~positive
I will be back!~positive
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.~positive
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.~negative

The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.~negative
Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .~positive
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .~positive
The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .~negative

It's all about the food !!~positive
I went there with my friend last saturday.~negative
first it took us a long time to find the place.~negative
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.~negative
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.~negative
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.~negative
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.~negative
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.~negative
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.~negative
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.~positive
Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.~positive
Try everything for that matter, it is all good.~positive
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.~positive
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.~positive
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.~positive
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.~positive
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.~positive

Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.~positive
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.~negative

Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.~positive
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!~positive
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!~negative
Much more reasonably priced too!~negative
I take all my NYC guests to VT's.~positive
Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!~positive
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.~positive
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.~positive
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.~positive
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.~negative
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .~positive
it's delicious!~positive
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!~positive

Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.~negative
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.~negative
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.~negative
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.~negative
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.~positive
Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.~positive
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.~negative
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction~positive
Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant.~positive
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.~positive
It is also extremely well priced.~positive
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.~positive
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.~positive
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.~positive
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!~positive
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.~negative
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...~negative
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes.~negative
Such a disappointment...~negative
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one~negative

I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!~positive
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.~positive
Our server was very helpful and friendly.~positive
I am bringing my whole family back next time.~positive
The food was good too.~positive
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.~positive
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.~positive
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.~negative
Service was prompt and courteous.~positive
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.~positive
Great service, great food.~positive
Prices are in line.~negative
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.~negative
But too far east!~negative
I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.~negative
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.~positive
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.~negative
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.~negative
So eat fast and order a lot.~negative
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!~negative

By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.~positive
fine dining restaurant quality.~positive
Over 100 different choices to create your own.~positive
A must try!~positive
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.~positive
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.~positive
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.~positive
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!~positive
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.~positive
I grew up on these bagels.~negative
The staff is no nonsense.~positive
The food options rule.~positive
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.~positive
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.~positive
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A.~negative
Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.~negative
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni. (~negative
For those of you who don't know, Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese, which happens to be my favorite.)~negative
He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!~positive
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.~negative
The sake menu should not be overlooked!~positive
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.~positive
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.~positive
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.~negative
Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.~positive
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).~positive

Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.~positive
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.~positive

I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.~positive
To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok.~negative
Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.~positive
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.~positive
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.~negative
As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.~negative
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.~positive
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.~positive
The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.~positive
I've never ordered anything else from their menu...there's no need to.~negative
It's simply the best meal in NYC.~positive
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.~positive
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.~positive
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.~negative
The restaurant is cute but not upscale.~negative
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.~positive
I would highly recommend it.~positive
It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.~positive
We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.~positive
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.~negative
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.~positive
The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.~positive
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.~positive
I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!~positive
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.~positive
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.~positive
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.~positive
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.~positive
Please take my advice, go and try this place.~positive
Its located in greenewich village.~negative
You will not be disapointed at all.~positive
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel.~negative
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem.~positive
The bagel was huge.~positive
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.~positive
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).~negative
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.~positive
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.~positive
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.~negative
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.~positive
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.~positive
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.~positive
All the staff is absolutely professional!!~positive
I sometimes see the waiters don't have enough knowledge of their dishes.~negative
But they do.~negative
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do...)~positive
If you want to dine with large party, I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT.~negative
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).~positive
This restaurant was way overhyped.~negative
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.~negative
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.~negative
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.~negative
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.~positive

keep up the good work.~positive
Hats off to the chef.~positive
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.~negative
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.~negative
It was wonderful.~positive
the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.~positive
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.~positive

Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.~negative
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.~positive
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.~positive
Salads were fantastic.~positive
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.~positive
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.~positive
We will be back.~positive
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.~positive
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.~negative
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.~positive
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.~positive
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.~negative
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.~positive
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.~positive
They have it all -- great price, food, and service.~positive
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.~negative

And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).~positive
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.~positive
This place is always very crowded and popular.~positive
Went here on a friend's reccomendation.~negative
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.~positive
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.~positive
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.~positive
We'd go back again~positive
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.~positive
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.~positive
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.~positive

The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.~positive
And where does Patis go wrong; no where.~positive
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.~positive
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.~positive
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.~positive
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).~negative

My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.~positive
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.~positive
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.~negative
Overall I would recommend it and go back again.~positive
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)~negative
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.~positive
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.~negative
MMmmm... it was delicious.~positive

We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.~negative
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!~positive
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.~positive
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.~positive
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.~negative
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.~negative
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.~negative
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.~negative
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.~positive
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.~positive
The filet mignon dish was superb!~positive
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.~positive
It's a small cute restaurant.~positive
I absolutely love this place!!!~positive
From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.~negative
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.~positive
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.~negative
The sushi is amazing!!!~positive
And amazingly cheap.~positive
Big thumbs up!~positive
Very affordable and excellent ambient!~positive
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.~negative
We were very disappointed.~negative
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.~negative
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.~positive
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.~negative
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!~positive
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.~positive
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.~positive
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.~positive
Check this place out!~positive
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!~positive
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.~negative
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.~negative
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.~negative
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.~negative
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.~negative
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.~negative
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc....~negative
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.~negative
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.~positive

To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.~negative
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.~negative
Fish was overdone.~negative
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.~positive

Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.~negative
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.~positive
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.~negative
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.~positive
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.~positive
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.~positive
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.~positive
It is simply amazing.~positive
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.~positive
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.~positive
You will find yourself returning quite often.~positive
P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.~negative
LOL~negative
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.~positive
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.~positive
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!~positive
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.~positive
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.~positive
Beautiful experience.~positive
The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.~positive
The staff offers impeccable service.~positive
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.~positive

I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.~negative
It was divine melts in your mouth.~positive
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .~positive
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough.~positive
We had Lava Cake... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it.~negative
It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!!~positive
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!~positive
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.~positive
If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.~positive
It's very spicy but not offensive.~positive
We will definitely go back.~positive
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.~positive
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.~positive
The wine list is excellent.~positive
The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.~positive
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.~positive

People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.~negative
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.~negative

With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.~negative

The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.~negative
We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.~negative
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.~negative
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.~negative
No plans to return anytime soon.~negative
This place is so much fun.~positive
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.~positive
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.~negative
I think the stuff was better than Disney.~negative
Our food was great too!~positive
And really large portions.~positive
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.~positive
We will go back every time we are in the City.~positive
If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.~positive
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.~positive
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.~positive
I highly recommend it.~positive
I am going to the mid town location next.~negative
The place is a lot of fun.~positive
My six year old loved it.~positive
The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.~positive
The food however, is what one might expect.~negative
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.~negative
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.~positive
We had a good time.~positive
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.~negative
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.~negative

Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.~negative
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.~positive
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.~positive
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.~positive
The lox is always fresh too.~positive
Highly recommended to all!~positive
I have to agree with the previous reviewer.~negative
I don't get it either.~negative
Not impressed with the food.~negative
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.~negative
Zero ambiance to boot.~negative
I thought this place was totally overrated.~negative
Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.~negative
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.~positive

When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices.~negative
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.~positive
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.~positive
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.~positive
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.~positive
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.~positive
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.~negative

This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!~negative
We weren't!~positive
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.~positive
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.~positive
Went there for an office lunch.~negative
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.~negative

I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.~positive
I had the best ravioli ever.~positive
The wine the service was very good too.~positive
Moderate prices.~negative
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!~negative
Molto bene!~negative
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.~positive
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.~positive
Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.~positive
Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.~positive

I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.~positive
If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.~positive
Check out the secret back room.~positive
Old school meets New world.~negative
I pray it stays open forever.~positive
Thank You Emilio.~positive
Ciao Bella~negative

Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad.~positive
Great staff.~positive
Always great service!~positive
I go twice a month!~positive
Fantastic!~positive
The food is good, I can't lie.~positive
But the staff was so horrible to us.~negative
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.~negative
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.~negative
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.~negative

The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.~negative

Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.~negative

First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.~positive
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by.~negative
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here.~negative
I am happy i did the food was awsome.~positive
JUST AWSOME.~positive
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.~positive
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey.~negative
but overall i give it a 10~positive
10~positive
I haven't been to the other locations.~negative
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.~negative
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.~negative
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.~negative
Will never be back.~negative
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.~negative
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.~negative
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.~negative
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.~negative
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice.~negative
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish.~negative
the waitstaffs are nice though.~positive
wont come back again for sure!~negative
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.~negative
Once for dinner and once for brunch.~negative
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.~negative
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.~negative
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.~negative
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.~negative
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.~negative
This was a great surprise.~positive
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.~positive
The service was attentive.~positive
I look forward to eating here again~positive
Planet Thai is great!~positive
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!~positive
The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!~negative

Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!~positive
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!~positive
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.~negative
It's popular w/the late crowd.~negative
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.~negative
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.~negative
Overall, not worth the money.~negative
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.~positive

Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.~positive
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.~positive
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.~negative
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.~negative
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.~negative
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.~positive
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.~positive
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.~positive

Went to Village last night for my birthday.~negative
We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.~negative
We were very pleasantly surprised.~positive
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.~positive
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.~positive
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.~positive
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.~positive
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.~negative
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.~negative
Why?~negative
They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.~negative
please don't fool us.~negative
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.~negative
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.~positive
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.~positive
Of course, it is crowded but who cares.~negative
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.~positive
Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.~positive
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.~positive
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.~positive
(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)~positive
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.~positive
Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.~positive
Definitely a neighborhood favorite.~positive
I loved this place!!~positive
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.~positive
The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great.~positive
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.~positive
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!~negative

The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.~negative
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.~negative
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.~negative
We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.~negative
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.~negative

It is thick and slightly soggy.~negative
Decor is charming.~positive
Service is average.~negative
What a great place.~positive
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.~negative
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.~positive
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.~negative
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!~positive
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.~negative
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.~negative
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently~negative
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.~negative
The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.~negative
Never again!~negative
I absolutely Loved this place.~positive
My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.~negative
Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.~positive
this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions.~positive

My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.~positive
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.~positive
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.~positive
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.~positive
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.~positive
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.~positive
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.~positive
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.~positive
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend.~negative
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had.~positive
I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.~positive
My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good...not outstanding, but good.~negative
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.~positive
Overall, excellent restaurant!~positive

But, they were too big for the bun.~negative
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.~negative
Also they were $15 each!~negative
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.~negative
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!~negative

The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.~negative
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.~negative
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.~negative
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.~positive
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.~positive
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.~positive
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.~positive
I will definetly be going back.~positive
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.~positive
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.~negative

it helps if you know what to order.~negative
and you can't beat the prices.~positive
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all.~positive
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.~positive
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).~positive
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.~positive
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.~negative
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.~positive
Also very inexpensive.~positive
A great choice at any cost and a great deal.~positive
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.~positive
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.~positive
Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.~negative
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.~positive
Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.~positive
Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.~negative
I've waited over one hour for food.~negative
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.~negative
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?~negative
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.~negative
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.~negative
This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money.~positive
An excellent service~positive
Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night.~negative
We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.~positive
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.~positive
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.~negative
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.~positive
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.~positive
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.~positive
I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.~negative

Always a nice crowd, but never loud.~positive
Go here.~positive
Good for dates or with friends.~positive
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.~positive
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.~positive
By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.~positive
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.~positive
For all you lazy folks that don't want to come to Alphabet City, I say, good - stay out.~negative
less wait time for me!~negative
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.~negative
The menu has so many fish items and oysters.~positive
We all ordered different entrees so we could share.~negative

All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!~positive
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.~positive
It's to die for!~positive
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.~negative
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.~negative
There are other people waiting!~negative
We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.~negative
As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.~negative
Our friends have not arrived yet.~negative
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!~negative
For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!~negative
I've been here twice now.~negative
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.~positive
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.~negative
I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.~negative
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.~positive
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.~positive
While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.~positive
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else.~positive
Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming.~positive
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!~positive
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.~positive
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.~negative
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.~negative
The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.~negative
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.~negative
The view is spectacular, and the food is great.~positive
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!~positive
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!~positive
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.~positive
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap... what more could you ask for?~positive
(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).~positive
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.~positive
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.~positive
Kind, attentive wait staff.~positive
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).~positive
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos.~positive
Delicious crab cakes too.~positive
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.~positive
Great neighborhood joint.~positive
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.~positive
Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.~negative
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.~negative
The counter service is bad.~negative
They charge different prices all the time.~negative
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.~negative
NO PIZZA 33 for me!~negative
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.~negative
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.~negative
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.~negative
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.~negative
Seriously, this place kicks ass.~positive
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.~positive
Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).~positive
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.~positive
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.~positive
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.~positive
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.~positive
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.~positive
This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.~positive
Great sushi experience.~positive
Nice value.~positive
Unique apppetizers.~positive
Try sushimi cucumber roll.~positive
Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.~positive
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.~negative
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.~negative
Murray won't do it.~negative
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.~negative
But who says Murray's is anything about service.~negative
So close, but not good enough.~negative
Don't be fooled by crowds of people.~negative
The service is awful.~negative
This place is not worth the prices.~negative
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.~negative
Love Pizza 33..~positive
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing... their Pizza.~positive
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.~negative
It hits the spot every time~positive
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.~positive
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.~positive
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).~negative
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.~positive
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!~negative
They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.~positive
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!~positive
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!~positive
A little crowded but they move that line really fast!~negative
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!~negative

Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!~negative
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!~negative
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!~negative
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..~negative
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..~positive
the turkey burgers are scary!~negative
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.~negative
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.~negative
The sushi was awful!~negative
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.~negative
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.~negative
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.~negative
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.~negative
Good, fast service.~positive
I would highly recommend.~positive
Food is great and inexpensive.~positive
The location is perfect.~positive
Give it a try and enjoy.~positive
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.~negative
Jimmy is Dominican!~negative
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.~negative
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.~negative
Would NEVER go back there.~negative
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.~negative
That place was awesome,,,  sally !~negative
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.~positive
Always busy but fast moving.~positive
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.~positive
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)~positive
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.~positive
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.~positive
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.~negative
What more can you ask for?~positive
For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.~positive
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).~negative
Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.~positive
Everything about this restaurant was special.~positive
The service was attentive, yet discreet.~positive
The flavors robust and subtle.~positive
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.~positive
I'm saving up for my next visit.~positive
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.~negative
The place was quiet and delightful.~positive
Service was good and food is wonderful.~positive
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)~positive
It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.~positive
As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.~positive
The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b way).~positive
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.~positive
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.~positive
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.~positive
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.~positive
You can't go wrong with this place.~positive
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.~positive
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.~positive
I LOVE their Thai~positive
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!~positive
I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.~negative
I will go back to Suan soon!~positive
In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!~positive
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.~positive
I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.~positive
I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.~positive
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.~negative
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.~negative
I wish they would change back to what it was before.~negative
The food now is inconsistent.~negative
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.~positive
The setting is casual and romantic.~positive
Prices are very good.~positive
The food is excellent!~positive
if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!~positive
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.~negative
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.~negative
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.~negative
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.~positive
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.~positive
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.~negative
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.~negative
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:~negative
(1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard~negative
(2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal.~negative
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.~negative
I was pleasantly suprised.~positive
The food was exceptional.~positive
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.~negative
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.~positive
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.~positive

the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily.~positive

i would just ask for no oil next time.~negative
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.~positive
The fried dumplings are GREAT!~positive
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!~positive
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.~negative
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.~negative
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!~negative
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.~negative
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.~negative
Never fails to please.~positive
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.~positive
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.~positive
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.~negative
Service is fast and friendly.~positive
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.~negative
But that is highly forgivable.~positive
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.~negative
The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.~negative
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.~negative
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.~negative
I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.~negative
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.~positive
You must try the shrimp appetizers.~positive
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.~positive
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.~positive
Great food, great prices, great service.~positive
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.~positive
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.~positive
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.~positive
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!~positive
I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.~negative
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.~negative
Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.~negative
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.~negative
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.~positive
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).~negative
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!~negative
The food was absolutely amazing!!~positive
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!!~positive
The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!~positive
The waiter was attentive.~positive
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.~positive
Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix: Appetizers were ok, waiter gave me poor suggestion..try the potato stuff kanish best one.~negative

Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.~negative

Dessert is a joke...dont bother~negative
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.~positive
The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.~positive
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.~positive
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.~positive
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...~negative

Fantastic place.~positive
Cute and decorative.~positive
A pleasant surprise.~positive
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.~positive
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.~positive
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.~negative
Great food, great decor, great service.~positive
I recommend it!~positive
Just ignore the trendy wannabes.~negative
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!~positive
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!~positive
Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)~positive
Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.~positive
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!~positive
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!~positive
Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...~positive
What a great place!~positive
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.~positive
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.~positive
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!~positive
Loved it!~positive
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.~negative
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.~positive
It is expensive but well worth the money.~negative
It is expensive but well worth the money.~positive
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.~positive
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.~positive
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.~positive
Wonderful at holiday time.~positive
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.~positive
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.~positive
Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.~negative
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.~positive
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.~negative
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.~positive
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.~negative
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.~negative
A real dissapointment.~negative
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.~negative
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.~negative
Priced at upper intermediate range.~negative
I really liked this place.~positive
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.~positive
It was pretty inexpensive too.~positive
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.~positive
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).~positive
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.~positive
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.~negative
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.~positive

Quick and friendly service.~positive
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.~positive
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy.~positive
When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St. Bart's.~negative
When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.~positive
The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.~positive
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.~positive
Ahhh...~negative
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.~positive
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.~positive
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.~positive
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.~positive
They all know you.~positive
Good food.~positive
Good drink.~positive
How do you rate home?~positive
I have never had cheescake like this.~positive
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.~positive
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.~positive
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.~positive
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.~positive
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.~positive
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.~negative
We were less than impressed.~negative
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.~positive
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.~negative
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.~negative
Probably would not go again...~negative
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.~positive
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.~positive
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.~negative
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.~negative
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.~positive
i would recommend reservations on weekends though.~negative
skip dessert.~negative
Best Reuben sandwich ever!~positive
A classic!~positive
Don't miss Bloom's on your next trip to Manhatten.~positive
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.~positive
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.~positive
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.~negative
The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.~negative
It just wasn't Thai.~negative
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca).~negative
Was surprisingly disappointed.~negative
Pizza was a little soggy.~negative
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.~positive
Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.~negative
Not enough wines by the glass either.~negative

Authentic Pakistani food.~positive
People are always friendly.~positive
Don't waste money on decor.~negative
Just straight up cheap, good food.~positive
Faan is sooo good.~positive
The best pad thai i've ever had.~positive
The design and atmosphere is just as good.~positive
bottles of wine are cheap and good.~positive
What more could you want?~positive
The food was actually aweful.~negative
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.~negative
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.~negative
Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.~positive
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!~negative
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.~positive
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.~positive
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.~positive
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.~positive
If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!~negative
go here for the drinks!~positive
esp. during happy hour!~negative
enough said!~negative
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.~positive
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.~positive
My fav was the sassy lassi...~positive
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.~positive
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.~positive
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.~positive
Amazing!~positive
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.~positive
The food's as good as ever.~positive
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.~positive
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.~positive
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.~negative
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.~negative
Can't wait to go back.~positive
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!~positive
Beef noodle soup is good as well.~positive
The service is good and the resturant is clean.~positive
Best Taiwanese food in NY!~positive
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.~positive
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.~positive
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.~positive
Good luck getting a table.~negative
My roommate and I LOVE this place.~positive
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.~positive
Indoor was very cozy and cute.~positive
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.~positive
While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.~negative
Staff is very accomodating.~positive
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.~positive
I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.~positive
But $1 for each small piece???~negative
Not worth it.~negative
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.~negative
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.~negative
The decor is very simple but comfortable.~positive
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.~positive

You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.~positive
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.~positive
I loved it and would go again.~positive
Great Indian food and the service is incredible.~positive
The owner truly caters to all your needs.~positive
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.~positive
Everyone was more then happy with his choices.~positive
Great food and the prices are very reasonable.~positive
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.~negative
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).~positive
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.~positive
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.~positive
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.~positive
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...~positive
Service is not what you are coming here for...~negative
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need...~negative
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.~positive
this place... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend.~negative
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.~positive
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.~positive
even the wine by the glass was good.~positive
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.~negative

Consistently good Japanese Tapas.~positive
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.~negative
Always good drinks and service is pretty good;~positive
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...~positive
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks...~positive
Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.~positive
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...~negative
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.~negative
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.~negative
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.~negative
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.~negative
No thanks!!!~negative
This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!~positive
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!~positive
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.~negative
We were then shooed inside.~negative
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.~negative
We left, never to return.~negative
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.~negative
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.~negative
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.~negative
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.~negative
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.~negative
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.~negative
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.~negative
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.~negative
They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.~negative
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.~positive
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.~negative
He offers subpar service and has no personality.~negative
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.~negative
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.~negative
There is no excuse for such lousy service!~negative
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.~negative
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.~negative
You can do it here.~positive
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.~positive
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.~positive
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.~negative
Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.~positive
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also.~negative
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!~positive
Me and my girls will definitely go back.~positive
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.~positive
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.~positive
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.~positive
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.~negative
The food is great.~positive
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.~positive
I heartily recommend.~positive
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.~negative
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.~negative
Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.~negative
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.~positive
The pizza was pretty good and huge.~positive
The price very reasonable.~positive
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.~positive
We got most of it back at home with us.~negative
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.~negative
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol~negative
No, really.~negative
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.~negative
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.~positive
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.~positive
I have been twice to this restaurant.~negative
I love it.~positive
I plan on stopping by next week as well.~positive
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.~positive
I recieved prompt service with a smile.~positive
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.~positive
Definately check it out!!!~positive
This place blew me away...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side.~positive
The wine list is extensive and impressive.~positive
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.~positive
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.~positive
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond.~negative
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.~positive
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.~positive
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!~positive
I lOVE THIS PLACE!~positive
Keep up the good work guys!~positive
My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.~negative
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.~positive
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.~positive
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.~positive
We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?~negative

Last night of holiday ruined by all appetisers and main courses served within 10 minutes. restaurant turned us over in 50 minutes from the moment we walked in. Terrible attitude from management.~negative
The food is all watered down. The Sushi is fake. Service is terrible and do not EVER order from them for delivery because NO ONE speaks Engrish!~negative
